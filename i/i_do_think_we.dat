2500|$|Asked by the Dallas Observer for {{his view}} of {{religion}} and spirituality, Lennon said,I'm not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society {{and it can be}} helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is mythology. ... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all have a spirit, and I think there's a lot more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. But I prefer looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously logical.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, sir. I {{am glad to}} {{hear the}} news, for {{to tell you the}} truth, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> want a little fresh blood amongst us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} might manage a shark, sir. I once saw one of those animals, and I do really believe the sogdollager would {{outweigh}} him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might manage a shark, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} go {{anywhere}} together, for my niece is {{in the care of}} this gentleman. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should be free from annoyance here, but I see I was mistaken. Mr. Parker, will you oblige me by taking Dolly home at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{buy that}} land {{if it was}} oil you were after. One time <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might strike it, but those as know told me there wasn't any there, after they'd looked the {{property}} over," [...] replied the old man, as with trembling hand he held the money toward George.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{shall have}} a verdict; <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> indeed. <b>I</b> {{would not say}} so before Lady Mason if my opinion was not very strong. The jury may disagree. That is not improbable. But I cannot {{anticipate}} that the verdict will be against us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is no {{time for}} rash acts or excited feelings, Joyce. Though, were my gallant boy with us, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might make a push at these fellows, with very {{reasonable}} chances of success." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. [Dreamily.] No! [To SNOW.] I 've been inquiring of the servants. This {{man does}} hang about the house. I shall feel much safer {{if he gets}} a good long sentence; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to be {{protected}} against such ruffians.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Mabel; and God {{bless you}} for {{thinking of the}} welfare of men as humble as we are. We have our pleasures, it is true, {{as well as our}} gifts, but we might be happier; yes, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might be happier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} absurd in one way," [...] Margaret agreed, [...] "but, {{as a matter}} of fact, my father's {{attitude}} about the place has always rather set me against it. I didn't feel that there was any pleasure to be gained by coming here. I won't tell you really what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think.</b> <b>We</b> must keep to our bargain. We are not to anticipate." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{want to get}} rid of patriotism, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could, even if {{we wanted}} to do so. It seems to be {{necessary}} to his moral life, that a man should feel himself part of a community, belonging to it, and it belonging to him. And that this community should be a single and lovable reality, inspired by a common idea, with a common fashion and aim.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell," [...] {{answered}} Evelyn. [...] "It's {{comforting to}} remember that she knows it better than <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to make for the Hause; there's only one place that's really steep. Keep up to the left a little; the Scale Crags must be close beneath us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Slife! What an impudent rogue have we here!" [...] {{cried the}} angry Duke, who {{conceived}} that Richard was purposely dealing in effrontery. [...] "Mr. Trenchard, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are wasting time. Be so good as to confound them {{both with the}} truth of this matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had an {{excellent}} mother, Oakes! Little do we think, in youth, how much we owe to the unextinguishable tenderness, and far-seeing lessons of our mothers! Ours both died while we were young, yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were their debtors for far more than we could ever repay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that, Bertie; and as we are in no extraordinary hurry <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might have been satisfied with felling the trees to- day, and cutting off the branches and getting them into place to-morrow. Still, as Dias seemed to make nothing of it, I {{did not like to}} knock off at the very start." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 interview, Middleton stated: [...] "It was a {{good time}} to call it a day. Unless theres a {{definite}} need and desire for us to play, <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should ever get back together. We always said we would again when we split up, but I think maybe its still too soon. Maybe in a few years when weve got time, well maybe try something for a laugh. Who knows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Captain Fort, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{are moving}} back to the apes; if we ever came from them. Those boys have the souls of heroes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUBEDAT [coming to them] I {{felt that}} I must {{shake hands with}} his friends once before we part to-day. We have shared {{together}} a great privilege and a great happiness. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can ever <b>think</b> of ourselves ordinary people again. We have had a wonderful experience; and that gives us a common faith, a common ideal, that nobody else can quite have. Life will always be beautiful to us: death will always be beautiful to us. May we shake hands on that? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{say what}} you like, Zephaniah, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were meant to have some {{happiness}} and pleasure on earth. If we were intended to go through life without laughing, why should {{we be able to}} laugh? Oh, how I should like to hear one hearty, natural laugh again before I die, such as I used to hear when I was a girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} were struck with that, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{have been a little}} rough to him." [...] Verena's we was angelic. [...] "He was {{particularly}} attentive to you, my dear; he has got over me. He looked at you so sweetly. Dearest Olive, if you marry him----!" [...] And Miss Tarrant, who was in high spirits, embraced her companion, to check her own silliness.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, Dick, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} try. I know I don't try half hard enough. It {{does n't do}} any good to think; when you think, {{everything}} seems so mixed, as if there were nothing to lay hold of. I do so hate to feel like that. It is n't as if we didn't know what's right. Sometimes I think, and think, and it 's all no good, only a waste of time, and you feel at the end as if you had been doing wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Margaret; [...] "as all her elders {{thought it}} right, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could advise her to refuse absolutely. Besides, {{it was a}} promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am {{giving you}} three weeks pay, which you <b>do</b> not deserve. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need {{to prolong the}} discussion," [...] and Captain Putnam turned away.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Ayotte {{criticized the}} 2008 bailouts, saying [...] "I wouldn't have {{supported}} the TARP or the bailouts... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should have bailed out the private sector." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Ethel, I {{think that}} most likely they will. As we came across the plain, I noticed several other parties quite in the distance. There must be a very strong body out altogether, and {{probably}} they have resolved upon vengeance for their last year's defeat. They had better have left it alone, for they have no more chance of taking this house, with us all upon our guard, than they have of flying. There is one advantage in it,--they will get such a lesson, that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall be perfectly free from Indian attacks for the future.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, we {{have brought}} our lads {{up to that}} feeling, certainly, though I would not have you fancy I am quite of that way of thinking. I am too old, and have seen too much service, Wallingford, not to know that every battle is liable to {{accidents}} and vicissitudes. There is some difference in service, I must suppose, though not half as much in men as is vulgarly imagined. The result {{is in the hands}} of God, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are fighting his battles, in this fearful war: therefore, I trust he will take care of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Ethel, I {{think that}} most likely they will. As we came across the plain I noticed several other parties quite in the distance.

6000|$|... "I do declare," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Archibald, [...] "everything {{is in the}} newspapers! <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> might {{settle down}} here and enjoy {{ourselves}} without people talking about our reason for coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|CAESAR. I {{will not}} forget. Farewell: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall meet again. Farewell. (He kisses {{her on the}} forehead. She is much {{affected}} and begins to sniff. He embarks.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kitty eats everything,' was the placid answer, 'and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{can blame}} Ellen, for she often comes down after our dinner to find {{something}} for the nursery supper.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me that was just the reason why I could speak about it, Miss Hannay. We may none of us get out of this fix we are in, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought all to be friends {{together}} now. Richards and I both agreed that as it was certain neither of us had a chance of winning you, the next best thing was to see you and Bathurst come together. Well, now all that's over, of course, but is it wrong for me to ask, how is it you have come to dislike him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Mary," [...] said she, [...] "I {{wish you}} had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; {{and when we got}} to the George, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Bible talk don't go {{for much}} in politics. Sabba' days are {{set aside for}} the Bible, and week-days for public and private matters. Now, here is Hugh Littlepage, of the same flesh and blood as my {{neighbor}} Holmes and myself be--no better and no worse; yes, I'm willing to allow he's no worse, in the main, though in some things <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might claim the preference; but I'll allow he's no worse, for the sake of argooment. Each on us rents a farm of this Littlepage, of a hundred acres good. Wa-al, this land we till, and crop, and labor, with our own hands, and the hands of our sons, and hired help, perhaps; and yet we have to pay fifty dollars apiece, annually, to that youngster, Hugh Littlepage, for rent; which money he takes and squanders where he pleases, in riotous livin', for't we know. Now, is that right, I ask; and isn't it an onsuitable state of things for a republican country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Henry {{spread his}} hands. [...] "After that, Killigrew, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can go further in this matter. Sir Oliver must go {{with us to}} England, and there take his trial." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not wish}} to {{discourage}} him by saying that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had yet reached Crocker's, but I believed I had a much better appreciation of our horse's slowness than he had.|$|R
6000|$|The girl's {{face flushed}} a little, {{and it was}} {{pleasant}} to see the quick indignation sparkle in her eyes. [...] "You never did anything unscrupulous; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are very rich," [...] she said.|$|R
