5|$|Large {{areas of}} {{limestone}} on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for caving. Some of the caves {{have been known}} about since {{the establishment of the}} Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit {{the vast majority of the}} caves, but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are easily accessible to the public. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to <b>discover</b> <b>new</b> caverns.|$|E

5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant. His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British landscape to check the location of previously recorded sites and <b>discover</b> <b>new</b> ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map. Based on his research in this region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open {{the path to the}} Phazon meteor impact crater, while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some of the items are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress. For example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or <b>discover</b> <b>new</b> ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the debris at the 10-megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test {{was a part of}} long-term project, {{one of the goals of}} which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm2·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary {{analysis of}} debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to <b>discover</b> <b>new</b> chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.|$|E

In this study, battle scenes in street dance were selected as an example of improvised performances. We conducted an experiment to investigate real-time cognitive processes. The results indicated three features: 1) Dancers mainly used well-practiced patterns, and <b>discovered</b> <b>new</b> patterns of dance; 2) In the process of <b>discovering</b> <b>new</b> patterns, dancers often utilized errors in their performance; 3) The processes of discovery were different in the performance of one dancer (solo scene) and the performance of two dancers (battle scene). In solo performance, dancers <b>discovered</b> <b>new</b> patterns by concentrating on their patterned dance. In battle performance, dancers <b>discovered</b> <b>new</b> patterns by utilizing stimuli from the situation (e. g. the music, their opponent) and using errors as an opportunity to loosen the constraints of their well-practiced patterns...|$|R

UNISOR was a consortium {{at that time of}} 13 institutions whose research scientists were collaborating at Oak Ridge supported by U.S. Energy Department grants together with Oak Ridge Associated Universities, of which Virginia Tech was one. Ijaz's research focused on the discovery of new isotopes using ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor. The reactor was built in 1965 with the highest neutron flux of any reactor at the time. It produced more medical isotopes while allowing higher fidelity of materials research than any other reactor available in the U.S. Energy Department's science and energy laboratory system during the 1970s.
