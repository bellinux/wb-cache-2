Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other embedded systems. By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate microprocessor, memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes.

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} a {{construction}} of a formal generic watermarking model in two stages, namely the basic model and the key-based model. The challenge here is to consider a ‘complete’ set of watermarking <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> and component <b>functions</b> in general from their specific information domains and function families. However, the problem {{can be reduced to}} a watermarking application(s), where a set of ‘possible’ <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs</b> and component <b>functions</b> can be defined in general to capture the fundamental properties of prominent schemes proposed today for the application(s). We therefore narrow down our scope to only the watermarking applications in digital images, and start constructing a basic model with considering the possible watermarking <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> component <b>functions</b> used in the applications. Later, a key-based model is developed by incorporating keys to the basic model for completeness. This would allow a designer to achieve any required security properties (e.g., authentication, confidentiality) and to employ any suitable cryptographic technique as a building block in a watermarking scheme.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} interpolative sigma delta modulators (SDMs). The design problem is formulated as two different optimization problems. The first optimization problem {{is to determine the}} denominator coefficients. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the energy of the error function in the passband of the loop filter in which the error function reflects the noise <b>output</b> transfer <b>function</b> and the ripple of the <b>input</b> <b>output</b> transfer <b>function.</b> The constraint of the optimization problem refers to the specification of the error function defined in the frequency domain. The second optimization problem is to determine the numerator coefficients in which the cost function is to minimize the stopband ripple energy of the loop filter subject to the stability condition of the noise <b>output</b> and <b>input</b> <b>output</b> transfer <b>functions.</b> These two optimization problems are actually quadratic semi-infinite programming (SIP) problems. By employing our recently proposed dual parameterization method for solving the problems, global optimal solutions that satisfy the corresponding continuous constraint are guaranteed if the solutions exist. The advantages of this formulation are the guarantee of the stability of the noise <b>output</b> and <b>input</b> <b>output</b> transfer <b>functions,</b> applicability to design rational IIR filters without imposing specific filter structures such as Laguerre filter and Butterworth filter structures, and the avoidance of the iterative design of numerator and the denominator coefficients because the convergence of the iterative design is not guaranteed. Our simulation results show that this proposed design yields a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the existing designs...|$|R

40|$|Cost or revenue {{efficiency}} measurement {{based on}} the approach initiated by Farrell has received great attention from academics and practitioners since the fifties. Farrell’s approach decomposes cost efficiency into two different sources, viz. technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. Technical efficiency is estimated by {{the implementation of the}} Shephard’s <b>input</b> or <b>output</b> distance <b>functions,</b> while allocative efficiency is derived as a residual between cost or revenue efficiency and its corresponding technical efficiency component. The directional distance function (DDF) was introduced later in the literature to complete duality theory with respect to the profit function and as a generalization of the Shephard <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> distance <b>functions.</b> Considering the case of cost efficiency we show that, although the DDF correctly encompasses the technical efficiency component of the Farrell approach, this is not true for the allocative component. Additionally, we show that allocative inefficiency is underestimated when the DDF-additive approach is used for decomposing cost inefficiency unless technical efficiency is assumed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOverall {{inefficiency}} {{measurement and}} decomposition {{are important for}} firms facing a world of changing prices since the resultant loss has implications on managers׳ decision making. In this paper, we draw attention to some problems within existing approaches to decompose overall inefficiency into its sources and propose new revenue and cost inefficiency measures based on the well-known Russell measures. Specifically, the technical inefficiency component is calculated by the Russell <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> measure, which is able to incorporate all sources of inefficiency corresponding to the <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> side, specifically <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> slacks, whereas allocative inefficiency is retrieved residually. All our results are derived from a new Fenchel–Mahler inequality using the theory of convex conjugates. This paper has several implications in theory and practice. From a theoretical point of view, we establish a natural dual relationship between the revenue (cost) function and the Russell <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> measure; despite the previous unsuccessful attempts in the literature to provide such duality result. From a practical point of view, we provide a way of decomposing revenue (cost) inefficiency into allocative inefficiency and a component that measures technical inefficiency {{in the sense of}} Pareto, contrasting with the usual approaches for decomposing revenue (cost) inefficiency, such as those based on Shephard׳s <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> distance <b>function</b> and the directional <b>output</b> (<b>input)</b> distance <b>function...</b>|$|R
