The Lincoln Journal started the trend in 1973. In some papers (such as the Tulsa World and Orlando Sentinel) Doonesbury appears on the opinions page alongside Mallard Fillmore, a politically conservative comic strip.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of understanding such transformation is {{it provides a}} more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, {{as well as other}} ecological settings, as places where indigenous populations <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> forces of nature. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an environment, not a society. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of anthropogenic transformation of both waterways and landscapes.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of intercalation fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside {{of this approach is}} that it is not possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomical {{classification}} {{of the glass}} frogs has been problematic. In 1991, after a major revision of the species and taxonomic characters, the herpetologists Pedro Ruiz-Carranza and John D. Lynch published {{a proposal for a}} taxonomic {{classification of}} the Centrolenidae based on cladistic principles and defining monophyletic groups. That paper was {{the first of a series}} of contributions dealing with the glass frogs from Colombia that led them to describe almost 50 species of glass frogs. The genus Centrolene was proposed to include the species with a humeral spine in adult males, and the genus Hyalinobatrachium to include the species with a bulbous liver. However, they left a heterogeneous group of species in the genus Cochranella, defined just by lacking a humeral spine and a bulbous liver. Since the publication of the extensive revision of the Colombian glass frogs, several other publications <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> glass frogs from Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.|$|E

500|$|Gallifrey was a Pip & Jane Baker {{script for}} four 25-minute episodes that was {{commissioned}} on 11 March 1985 {{in the wake}} of the hiatus announcement, that reportedly would <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> destruction of the Doctor's aforementioned home planet.

500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and for what purpose is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "Offerings {{to earth and}} water in Pre-Roman and Roman Times", Merrifield explores {{the various forms of}} archaeological {{evidence}} for ritual deposits in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain. He provides an overview of the evidence for animal and human sacrifice, as well as that in support of ritual offerings in bodies of water such as the River Thames. Merrifield deals with votive deposits on land, in particular looking at the evidence for deposition in ditches, shafts and wells. He rounds off the chapter by examining evidence for Iron Age rituals that took place at the commencement and termination of building constructions. Chapter three, [...] "Rituals of Death", deals with the religious rituals accompanying death and burial, and their visibility in the archaeological record. It explains the three main ways which human communities <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corpses of the dead: through exposing them to elements and scavengers, through inhumation and through cremation. Looing at beliefs surrounding the afterlife, Merrifield discusses ways in which these beliefs might be visible in the archaeological record, such as through the deposition of grave goods. Discussing evidence for rituals of separation through which the deceased is separated from the world of the living, including those that deal with the decapitation of the body, Merrifield then looks at the effect of Christianity on burials in Europe, arguing that it brought a new intimacy with the dead through the collection of relics, which was in contrast to the pagan beliefs of the Roman Empire, which portrayed the deceased as unclean.|$|E

2500|$|Legal scholars' main {{criticism}} of the decision was its failure to define [...] "testimonial".

2500|$|Contemporary specialists, {{primarily}} {{physicians who}} <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eminescu case, reject both hypotheses on {{the cause of}} death of the poet. According to them, the poet died of cardio-respiratory arrest caused by mercury poisoning. Eminescu was wrongly diagnosed and treated, aiming his removal from public life, as some eminescologists claim. Eminescu was diagnosed since 1886 by Dr. Julian Bogdan from Iași as syphilitic, paralytic and on the verge of dementia due to alcohol abuse and syphilitic gummas emerged on the brain. The same diagnosis is given by Dr. Panait Zosin, who consulted Eminescu on 6 November 1886 and wrote that patient Eminescu suffered from a [...] "mental alienation", caused by the emergence of syphilis and worsened by alcoholism. Further research showed that the poet was not suffering from syphilis.|$|E

2500|$|The 1990 {{collection}} In Search of Civil Society: Independent Peace Movements in the Soviet Bloc {{is structured}} around {{the transformation of}} the peace movements into anti-communist and dissident forces in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Hungary, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and East Germany. It notably includes articles by two participants in such movements, Hungary's Miklós Haraszti and Russia's Eduard Kuznetsov. American University reviewer Laszlo Kürti called the volume [...] "a milestone that will remain on reading lists for many years to come", but criticized Tismăneanu for not explaining neither the end of such movements nor their absence from other countries. Writing in 1999, scholar Gillian Wylie noted that, with In Search of Civil Society, Tismăneanu was one of the [...] "few academics beyond those involved in the peace activist community" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> topic of peace movements in Warsaw Pact countries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} {{accuracy of}} Livy's account is disputed among modern historians. [...] They {{are willing to}} accept that while Livy might have simplified {{the way in which the}} Sidicini, Campani and Samnites came to be at war, his narrative is here, at least in outline, historical. [...] The Sidicini's stronghold at Teanum controlled an important regional crossroads, which would have provided the Samnites with a motive for conquest. [...] The First Samnite War might have started quite by accident, as Livy claimed. [...] The Sidicini were located on the Samnite river side of the Liris, and while the Roman-Samnite treaty might only <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> middle Liris, not the lower, Rome does not appear to have been overly concerned for the fate of the Sidicini. The Samnites could therefore go to war with Sidicini without fear of Roman involvement. It was only the unforeseen involvement of the Campani that brought in the Romans.|$|E

2500|$|Several Jewish writers <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{issue of}} theodicy: {{whether and how}} God is all-powerful and all-good, given the {{existence}} of evil in the world, particularly the Holocaust. Jon D. Levenson argues that omnipotence doctrine fails to [...] "give due regard to [...] "'the formidability and resilience of the forces counteracting creation" [...] (such as the primordial state of chaos existing before creation) and [...] "leads to a neglect {{of the role of}} humanity in forming and stating the world order. Hans Jonas proposed a [...] "tentative myth" [...] that [...] "God 'chose' in the beginning to give God's self 'over to the chance and risk and endless variety of becoming, entering into the adventure of space in time." [...] Jones expressed the view that [...] "God does not create the world by fiat [...] (although God does create the world), but leads it by beckoning it into novel possibilities of becoming.

2500|$|In early January 2009, Romney {{supported}} the $750 billion federal {{economic stimulus package}} proposed by the incoming president, Barack Obama, {{who had not yet}} taken office. Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers of jobs that had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E
2500|$|Condemnations of slow {{government}} {{action in the}} relief effort {{in response to the}} typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed. Media reports criticized the Aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation. Up until November 12, five days after the typhoon struck, survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter while remote towns in Leyte and Samar were yet to be reached by aid. The Philippine government responded by saying that they <b>have</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tragedy [...] "quite well" [...] but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees, who were usually the first to respond in these events, were victims of the typhoon themselves. Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors. The national Government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the Bureau of Fire instead to the Department of Health. Dr. Racquel Fortun, one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of DOH.|$|E
