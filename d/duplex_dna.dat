5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of <b>duplex</b> <b>DNA,</b> and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. Homologous recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
25|$|During DNA replication, the {{replisome}} will unwind {{the parental}} <b>duplex</b> <b>DNA</b> into a two single-stranded DNA template replication fork in a 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is the template strand {{that is being}} replicated {{in the same direction}} as the movement of the replication fork. This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5' to 3' {{in the same direction as}} the movement of the replication fork.|$|E
25|$|In G1 {{phase of}} the cell cycle, many of the DNA {{replication}} regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, {{the vast majority of}} DNA synthesis occurs during S {{phase of the}} cell cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G2, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental <b>duplex</b> <b>DNA</b> and one nascent antiparallel strand.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient, PCR-mediated protocol for random chemical mutagenesis of cloned <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The method involves a single molecular cloning step and {{is compatible with}} a wide variety of recombinant DNA vectors.

40|$|An {{important}} step in genetic recombination is DNA branch migration, {{the movement of the}} Holliday junction or exchange point between two homologous <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> We have determined kinetic parameters of spontaneous branch migration as a function of temperature and ionic conditions. The branch migration substrates consist of two homologous <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs</b> each having two single-strand tails at one end that are complementary to the corresponding single-strand tails of the other duplex. Upon rapid annealing of the two <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs,</b> a four-stranded intermediate is formed that has a Holliday junction {{at one end of the}} duplexes. Branch migration to the opposite end of the duplexes results in complete strand exchange and formation of two duplex products. The rate of branch migration is exceedingly sensitive to the type of metal ions present. In magnesium, branch migration is quite slow with a step time, tau, equal to 300 msec at 37 degrees C. Surprisingly, branch migration in the absence of magnesium was 1000 times faster. Despite this difference in rates, apparent activation energies for the branch migration step in the presence and absence of magnesium are similar. Since metal ions have a profound effect on the structure of the Holliday junction, it appears that the structure of the branch point plays a key role in determining the rate of spontaneous DNA branch migration. We discuss the role of proteins in promoting the branch migration step during homologous recombination...|$|R

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{neighboring}} bases and secondary structure {{to detect the}} frequency of frameshift mutations has been investigated in depth using fluorescence. Fluorescently tagged DNA, by means of base analogues, permits one to study the local changes of a DNA sequence. Studies {{on the effects of}} the length of the primer strand reveal that an equilibrium mixture of four hybridization conformations was observed when template bases looped-out as a bulge, i.e. a structure flanked on both sides by <b>duplex</b> <b>DNA.</b> In contrast, a double-loop structure with an unusual unstacked DNA conformation at its downstream edge was observed when the extruded bases were positioned at the primer–template junction, showing that misalignments can be modified by neighboring DNA secondary structure.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a major}} DNA {{repair process}} in bacteria. [...] It is also important for producing genetic diversity in bacterial populations, although the process differs substantially from meiotic recombination, which repairs DNA damages and brings about diversity in eukaryotic genomes. [...] Homologous recombination has been most studied and is best understood for Escherichia coli. [...] Double-strand DNA breaks in bacteria are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. [...] Breaks that occur on {{only one of the}} two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway.

40|$|Adenovirus DNA binding {{protein is}} a {{multifunctional}} protein essential for viral DNA replication. To investigate {{the role of}} the DNA binding protein in this process its interaction with partial <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> was examined. <b>Duplex</b> regions of <b>DNA,</b> created when a short DNA strand is annealed to its complementary sequence present in the single stranded form of M 13 phage DNA, were efficiently unwound by DNA binding protein in a reaction that required neither ATP nor MgCl 2. The unwinding activity of DNA binding protein was reduced by conditions which increased the stability of <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes.</b> <b>DNA</b> unwinding by DNA binding protein was highly co-operative and required the single stranded DNA to be completely coated with the protein. Completely double stranded DNA could also be unwound by DNA binding protein but this reaction was sensitive to the G+C content of the DNA and could only be observed with relatively short <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> up to 45 base pairs in length. When these short double stranded DNA molecules contained binding sites for the transcription factors NFI and NFIII addition of the cognate factor blocked DNA binding protein mediated unwinding of the particular <b>DNA</b> <b>duplex.</b> Cleavage of <b>DNA</b> binding protein with chymotrypsin and isolation of the 39, 000 molecular weight C-terminal fragment indicated that the unwinding activity was located in this domain of the protein. In support of this contention a monoclonal antibody, which had previously been mapped to this region, specifically inhibited the DNA unwinding activity. These activities of DNA binding protein are likely to be involved in DNA replication, where the destabilisation of <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> could be important both during initiation and elongation...|$|R
40|$|The {{stabilization}} of G-quadruplex DNA structures by using small molecule ligands having simple structural scaffolds {{has the potential}} to be harnessed for developing next generation anticancer agents. Because of the structural diversity of G-quadruplexes, it is challenging to design stabilizing ligands, which can specifically bind to a particular quadruplex topology. To address this, herein, we report the design and synthesis of three benzothiazole hydrazones of furylbenzamides having different side chains (ligands 1, 2 and 3), which show preferential {{stabilization of}} promoter quadruplex DNAs (c-MYC and c-KIT 1) having parallel topologies over telomeric and <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The CD melting study revealed that all the ligands, in particular ligand 2, exhibit higher stabilization toward parallel promoter quadruplexes (Delta T-m = 10 - 15 degrees C) as compared to antiparallel promoter quadruplex (h-RAS 1), telomeric quadruplex and <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs</b> (Delta T-m = 0 - 3 degrees C). FID assay and fluorimetric titration results also reveal the preferential binding of ligands toward c-MYC and c-KIT 1 promoter quadruplex DNAs over telomeric and <b>duplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Validating these results further, Taq DNA polymerase stop assay showed IC 50 similar to 6. 4 mu M for ligand 2 with the c-MYC DNA template, whereas the same for the telomeric DNA template was found to be > 200 mu M. Molecular modeling and dynamics studies demonstrated a 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry in which stacking and electrostatic interactions play important roles in stabilizing the c-MYC G-quadruplex structure. Taken together, the results presented here provide new insights into the design of structurally simple scaffolds for the preferential stabilization of a particular G-quadruplex topology...|$|R

40|$|An {{endonuclease}} {{associated with}} the core of Friend leukemia virus (FLV) has been purified more than 10 (3) -fold by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined by gel filtration to be about 40, 000. Divalent cations were required for the endonuclease to function and KCl concentrations above 50 mM inhibited the enzyme activity. In the presence of Mg++ the purified enzyme nicked preferentially supercoiled circular <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> and {{in most of these}} molecules only one single-stranded nick was introduced per strand. The regions into which the nick could be introduced appeared to be randomly distributed on the circular molecule. When Mn++ was substituted for Mg++ the number of nicks introduced into DNA by the purified enzyme was greatly increased, and both relaxed circular and linear <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> were nicked as well as supercoiled circular <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes.</b> Prior to its purification, however, in the presence of Mn++ the endonuclease activity in the virus extract was able to differentiate between circular and linear <b>DNA</b> <b>duplexes,</b> since both supercoiled and relaxed circular duplexes were nicked much more readily than linear <b>duplexes.</b> Single-stranded <b>DNA</b> functioned poorly as a substrate for the purified enzyme...|$|R
