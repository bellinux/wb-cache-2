40|$|Design {{activity}} modelling {{has received}} significant attention in research {{over the last}} 30 years {{with a focus on}} both descriptive and prescriptive models. This has resulted in the development of models offering different viewpoints of the design process, such as the description of the process in terms of activities/stages, the cognitive nature of design as described by Smithers and those relating design within an overall model of product development. These models focus primarily on the activities required to create a design solution, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>design</b> activities, in isolation of the activities involved in managing the process by which that solution is developed, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>design</b> management activities, and the relationship between them. This paper presents a novel formalism describing activities focused both on the design and its development, i. e. the design development process. The model describes how outputs of design and design management activities are evaluated within a model of performance measurement and management in design development...|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{secondary}} analysis of a prior systematic review {{was to determine the}} degree to which group dynamics–based physical activity interventions align with research processes and outcomes that are more likely to facilitate the translation of research into practice. To accomplish this, a systematic search was conducted within Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, and MEDLINE databases to identify articles published prior to 2010 that used at least one group dynamics–based strategy (e. g., group interaction, group goal setting) in physical activity promotion. These 17 intervention studies were identified and coded based on the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance framework and Pragmatic–Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (for trial design characteristics). Reporting was infrequent for external validity factors (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> representativeness, adoption, cost, maintenance) but more frequent for internal validity factors (e. g., inclusion criteria). Intervention costs were not reported. Studies {{were more likely to be}} pragmatic (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>designed</b> to determine the effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it will be applied) in areas of participant compliance and practitioner adherence and explanatory (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>designed</b> to determine the effects of an intervention under ideal conditions) and in areas of practitioner expertise and flexibility of intervention protocol. While a number of these interventions were tested in more pragmatic settings, external validity factors were still underreported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} model checking real-life VHDLbased hardware designs via their automated transformation to a model verifiable using the SMV model checker. In particular, model checking of asynchronous <b>designs,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>designs</b> driven by multiple clocks, is discussed. Two original approaches to compiling asynchronous VHDL designs to the SMV language such that errors possibly arising from the asynchronicity are preserved are proposed. The paper also presents results of experiments with using the proposed methods for verification of several real-life asynchronous components of an FPGA-based router being developed within the Liberouter project. ...|$|R
