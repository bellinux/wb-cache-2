5|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 5,045,356 houses in Ohio, of which 4,499,506, or about 89.2% are estimated to be occupied; this is 0.8% above the national average rate of occupation. Houses with a mortgage are estimated to cost owners about $1,216 per month, which is $186 below the national average. The United States Census Bureau also estimates that 3,150,239 houses are owner-occupied, or about 70%, which is 2.7% above the national average, and that an estimated 1,349,267 houses are renter-occupied. The median house value is $135,200, which is a significant $50,000 below the national average. Also, {{there are an}} estimated 545,850 unoccupied houses. It is also <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plurality of houses in Ohio were built from 1940 to 1959 (1,175,325 houses), and that 3,058,721 houses are in some way dependent on utility gas.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine {{strategy}} at this battle, ambushing a raiding army on its return journey {{when it would}} be slowed by plunder and captives, is exactly what is prescribed in much earlier Byzantine military treatises, such as the Tactica of Leo VI (886–912). This points to a retention by Byzantine commanders of knowledge of the successful military strategies of the past.|$|E

25|$|Testaments are {{regarded}} as exhortatory writings; ethics therefore are fundamental to the text. The Testaments have many different ethical motifs, the foremost of which is adhering to God's commandments. In this regard, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ethics in the Testaments generally start out very precise; each testament discusses a certain vice or virtue. Usually this is then concluded with a very vague and general reference to God's law and commandments.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself {{is nothing to be}} concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is strongly exothermic, so the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature. However, {{a temperature of}} around 400°C is {{required in order to}} achieve a reasonable rate of reaction with currently available catalysts. Formation of ammonia is also favoured by high pressure, as the volume decreases when the reaction takes place. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same reaction, nitrogen fixation, occurs at ambient temperatures in nature, when the catalyst is an enzyme such as nitrogenase. Much energy is needed initially to break the nitrogen–nitrogen triple bond even though the overall {{reaction is}} exothermic.|$|E

25|$|The 25mm is {{a one-man}} {{operated}} weapon that complements the larger caliber artillery systems. It remains {{as a popular}} gun mount on smaller vessels, particularly landing ships and mine warfare designs. Machine guns such as the 12.7mm and 14.5mm are also classified as automatic weapons; being widely operated as short-range self-defense weapons on most amphibious craft. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of Chinese naval auxiliary ships possess manually operated anti-aircraft artillery, {{in contrast to the}} majority of Western navies, which have few or no armaments on board their auxiliaries.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, Masten built a barn. He made {{few other}} {{modifications}} to the property, and passed it along to his son Hiram in 1876. It remained in the Masten family for another two decades, until 1895. Afterwards it passed through several different owners until becoming property of John and Kate Linton in 1909. They continued to own it until John's death in 1948 (his wife predeceased him), when it was passed to his wife's nephew Joseph Quinn. It's <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house never contained an indoor toilet until after Linton's death, as {{he felt that the}} practice was unsanitary. The Linton's were buried in Sylvan cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the demands}} of {{performance}} companies who insisted on higher ticket prices to justify a trip to Coldwater, Jackson {{found it necessary to}} raise ticket prices for the first time. This was met with stiff opposition and criticism by reviewers from the two major local newspapers, The Courier and The Republican. Although these newspapers were unable to deny Jackson's successful management of the theatre, the rift between the press and Tibbits increasingly began to widen. It was a third upstart newspaper, The Daily Reporter, which defended Jackson's management. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only paper that ultimately went on to survive was the one that tied its loyalty to the historic opera house.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mean percent {{methylation}} of H19 CpGs {{at sites}} 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals. This is because methylation of CpGs after the transcription start site {{is assumed to}} interfere with RNA polymerase II during transcription. Another point of interest is the significant difference in CpG methylation at site 11 between normal and hyperplasia adrenals. The mean percent CpG methylation at site 11 for hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals is significantly {{different from that of}} normal adrenals and carcinoma adrenals, leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread methylation of the H19 promoter.|$|E
25|$|Not {{far from}} the Porta Venezia is the Porta Nuova, the work of Giuseppe Zanoia, {{completed}} in 1812 in a design inspired by Rome's Arch of Titus. Here it is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two customs offices have been integrated {{into the body of}} the arch. As sandstone was used for the project, the original decorations have been seriously worn. Nevertheless, some of the figures sculpted by Camillo Pacetti and Luigi Acquisti remain in excellent condition. Also in the vicinity is the single-arched Porta Garibaldi, until 1860 called the Porta Comasina, which was designed by Giacomo Moraglia in 1807. The customs houses were added in 1836. Its less monumental proportions are better suited to the surrounding streets as the gate {{was at the end of}} a road with several bends, hardly compatible with a grandiose project.|$|E
25|$|The Beard {{eventually}} {{transferred to}} New York {{where in the}} 1967–1968 Obie Theatre Awards, it won Best Director and Best Actress. It has since played successfully {{all over the world}} and is a favorite with American university drama groups. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> play has enjoyed particular success in London, having been produced there twice. In 1968, actor Rip Torn directed a notable production at The Royal Court Theatre and it has most recently been revived at a smaller venue, the Old Red Lion Theatre in 2006 under the direction of Nic Saunders with new music by Terry Riley. The play is currently out of print in both the US and UK. Saunders would collaborate with McClure a second time in 2008 on the award-winning short film Curses and Sermons, which would mark the first time McClure had authorized a filmed adaptation of one of his poems.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Turkish films {{produced}} before 1950 were projects {{initiated by}} import companies owned by local families, most notably İpek Film, a daughter {{company of the}} İpek Merchandise, an import company that was advertising in Ottoman literary journals such as Servet-i Fünun {{as early as the}} 19th century. Another important company in the early era of Turkish cinema was Kemal Film, a company whose continuous presence as a leading import company has been often overlooked for a few local films it produced during the 1920s. (It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> founders of Kemal Film bought their first film camera on loan from the Ipek Merchandise). Both companies would be the strongest film distributors until the 1950s and the only companies that were financially sound enough to produce films themselves, with low risks for financial failure as they already were in possession of a distribution system and theatre chains that guaranteed a return on investment.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of two supplementary functions, D and E, {{have also been}} proposed {{in addition to the}} A, B and C functions already discussed. Function D specifies the identity of the ovule, as a separate reproductive function from the development of the carpels, which occurs after their determination. Function E relates to a physiological requirement that is a characteristic of all floral verticils, although, it was initially described as necessary {{for the development of the}} three innermost verticils (Function E sensu stricto). However, its broader definition (sensu lato) suggests that it is required in the four verticils. Therefore, when Function D is lost the structure of the ovules becomes similar to that of leaves and when Function E is lost sensu stricto, the floral organs of the three outer most verticils are transformed into sepals, while on losing Function E sensu lato, all the verticils are similar to leaves. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gene products of genes with D and E functions are also MADS-box genes.|$|E
