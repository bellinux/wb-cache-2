50|$|In {{numerous}} {{industries such as}} agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, <b>halogenated</b> chemicals abound. <b>Aryl</b> halides {{are also}} important intermediates in the syntheses of other compounds due to their versatility in reactions such as nucleophilic aromatic substitution and coupling reactions. Traditionally, in chemical synthesis, arenes are halogenated by electrophilic aromatic substitution, a process that often suffers from poor regioselectivity and makes use of toxic reagents and catalysts under harsh reaction conditions. Tryptophan 7-halogenase circumvents these issues, halogenating its substrate regioselectively and using halide salts and molecular oxygen as reagents at room temperature and fairly neutral pH. Consequently, much research has been dedicated to modifying characteristics of tryptophan 7-halogenase to change properties such as substrate scope, optimal operating temperature, thermal stability, regioselectivity, and more.|$|R
40|$|This thesis details {{synthetic}} studies {{towards the}} total synthesis of RP 66453, a natural product isolated from {{a strain of}} Actinomycetes bacteria which is shown to bind to the neurotensin antagonist of guinea pigs. RP 66453 provides an attractive target as its bis-macrocyclic core contains a biaryl axis that displays atropisomerism. The natural atropisomer of RP 66453 is less stable than its diastereoatropisomer. To date {{there have been no}} reported syntheses of the natural product, and just one reported synthesis of the unnatural atropisomer. This thesis describes a new approach towards the synthesis of this challenging natural product. Model studies are described towards the formation of the biaryl macrocyclic ring via a radical induced transannular ring contraction of a <b>halogenated</b> benzyl <b>aryl</b> ether. Also described are model studies towards the formation of the biaryl linkage via phenanthrene formation, accessed in turn from a radical induced transannular ring contraction of a halogenated stilbene. Unfortunately, though short synthetic routes to these macrocyclic precursors were established, we were unable to realize either of the key steps. Synthesis of the second macrocycle (ether ring) was achieved via an SNAr ring closure. Coupling of this fragment to an advanced tetrapeptide intermediate was achieved. Further macrocyclisation is needed to advance this material to the natural product. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Organophosphates in {{increasing}} amounts and wider varieties of molecular structure {{are being used}} to replace the organochlorine pesticides. It has been assumed that the organophosphates as a class would have a minimal chronic toxicity due to rapid hydrolysis and an unfavorable partitioning as regards to lipids. The physicochemical properties of a number of representative organophosphates were determined, including the octanol/water partition coeffecient, hydrolysis, and binding to proteins. Those having a <b>halogenated</b> <b>aryl</b> substitution were found to have partition coefficients not largely different from the organochlorines, suggesting the possibility of fat deposition. Certain of these compounds are sufficiently stable toward hydrolysis to allow bioaccumulation to occur. These preliminary findings appear to indicate a correlation between readily determined physical properties and the potential for chronic effects in this class of compounds...|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} and charge transport {{properties of the}} derivatives based on tetracene with aryl and <b>halogenated</b> <b>aryl</b> substituents have been investigated theoretically. This kind of functionalization is demonstrated {{to have a significant}} effect to stabilize the molecular orbital, densify the molecular packing, enhance the electronic coupling, and further lead to a high mobility, though it would also cause some increases in the reorganization energy. The packing modes of FPPT and PPT crystals are analyzed in details and effective coupling projected areas are put forward to understand the intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, FPPT is found to have a well-ordered packing as well as the improved hole mobility of 4. 67 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1). In addition, the contributions of different frequencies of vibration to the total reorganization energies are also discussed with the normal mode analysis. This study clarifies the halogenated substituent effect on transport properties and provides the guide for molecular design of novel functional materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Mixed {{cultures}} of anaerobic bacteria capable of reductively dechlorinating freshly spiked 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1, 2, 3, 4 -TeCDD) {{were obtained from}} freshwater sediments of streams near Bitterfeld, Germany. All of these sediments have been impacted by industrial wastewater for decades, but have comparably low levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and-furans (PCDD and PCDF), not exceeding 500 ng toxicity equivalents (I-TEQ) per kg dry weight. Reductive dechlorination of 1, 2, 3, 4 -TeCDD in the primary enrichments as well as dechlorination of trichlorinated dioxin congeners in subsequent transfers showed that dioxin-dechlorinating bacteria could be enriched from these low-level contaminated sites. The amount of two transformation products, 1, 3 - and 2, 3 -di-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was different in the studied cultures, demonstrating preferential substitution of chlorine in either peri- or lateral positions of the molecule. Ten different dioxin-dechlorinating cultures were analyzed with a 16 S rDNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to detect phylotypes of bacteria known {{to be able to}} reductively dechlorinate several <b>halogenated</b> aliphatic and <b>aryl</b> compounds. Using this qualitative approach, we could not assign a specific dechlorination pathway to {{the presence or absence of}} specific dehalogenating organisms. However, it was shown that members of Desulfito-bacterium and Dehalococcoides were present in all communities studied, including cultures from Spittelwasser sediments (Bunge et al., 2001), and might be involved in reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated dioxins...|$|R
40|$|The esterases and lipases {{from the}} / {{hydrolase}} superfamily exhibit an enormous sequence diversity, fold plasticity, and activities. Here, we present the comprehensive sequence and biochemical analyses of seven distinct esterases and lipases from the metagenome of Lake Arreo, an evaporite karstic lake in Spain (42 ° 46 =N, 2 ° 59 =W; altitude, 655 m). Together with oligonucleotide usage patterns and BLASTP analysis, our study of esterases/lipases mined from Lake Arreo suggests that its sediment contains moderately halophilic and cold-adapted proteobacteria containing DNA fragments of distantly related plasmids or chromosomal genomic islands of plasmid and phage origins. This metagenome encodes esterases/lipases with broad substrate profiles (tested over {{a set of}} 101 structurally diverse esters) and habitat-specific characteristics, as they exhibit maximal activity at alkaline pH (8. 0 to 8. 5) and temperature of 16 to 40 °C, and they are stimulated (1. 5 to 2. 2 times) by chloride ions (0. 1 to 1. 2 M), reflecting an adaptation to environmental conditions. Our work provides further insights into the potential significance of the Lake Arreo esterases/lipases for biotechnology processes (i. e., production of enantiomers and sugar esters), because these enzymes are salt tolerant and are active at low temperatures and against {{a broad range of}} substrates. As an example, the ability of a single protein to hydrolyze triacylglycerols, (non) <b>halogenated</b> alkyl and <b>aryl</b> esters, cinnamoyl and carbohydrate esters, lactones, and chiral epoxides to a similar extent was demonstrated.

It was evident from the QSARs for PCBs that there was an excellent correspondence between the in vivo and in vitro potencies of the individual PCB congeners. The effects of substituents on both receptor binding and AHH/EROD induction was determined for a series of 4 '-substituted (X) - 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobiphenyls (where X = H, Cl, Br, I, OH, OCH 3, NO 2, COCH 3, F, CF 3, CH 3, C 2 H 5, i-C 3 H 7, n-C 4 H 9 and t-C 4 H 9). Not unexpectedly, there was a linear relationship between the -log EC 50 values for AHH and EROD induction, and these results confirm that both enzymatic oxidations are catalyzed by the same cytochrome P- 450 isozyme(s). The effects of substituent structure on receptor binding for 12 substituents was subjected to multiple regression analysis which correlates the relative binding affinities of the compounds with the physical chemical characteristics of the substituents. The analysis gave the following equation: log (1 /EC 50) = 1. 53 sigma + 1. 47 pi + 1. 09 HB + 4. 08 for n = 12, s = 0. 18, r = 0. 978; where n is the number of substituents, s is the standard deviation, r is the correlation coefficient, and sigma = electronegativity, pi = hydrophobicity (log P) and HB = hydrogen bonding capacity for the substituent groups.
