5000|$|Glass {{and plastic}} can be coated to {{diminish}} the amount of ultraviolet radiation that passes through. Common uses of such coating include eyeglasses and automotive windows. Photographic filters remove ultraviolet to prevent exposure of the film or sensor by invisible light. UV curable coatings {{can be used to}} impart a variety of properties to polymeric surfaces, including glare reduction, wear or scratch resistance, anti-fogging, microbial resistance, chemical resistance. Computer screens, keyboards, and most other personal electronic devices are treated with some type of UV-curable coating. Coatings are usually applied to plastic substrates via spray, <b>dip,</b> <b>roll,</b> flow and other processes. UV-curable coatings are often specified for plastic parts because the process does not require heat, which can distort the plastic shape. http://www.pcoatingsintl.com/article/2007/0503/article_205.html ...|$|E

50|$|Rigging a {{preventer}} on a yacht's mainsail {{is often}} performed {{when the wind}} is behind the beam (i.e. when it's coming from more than 90° off the bow). It can also be useful at other times when there is more swell than wind, a situation when the wind {{may not have the}} strength to keep the boom in place as the boat <b>dips</b> and <b>rolls.</b>|$|R
50|$|David Martin persuaded Binder to run Philippe's at its new location. Binder {{kept the}} restaurant's menu {{virtually}} the same, focusing on its famous French dip sandwiches, which uses roast beef, ham, roast pork, lamb or turkey on a French <b>roll,</b> <b>dipped</b> in au jus.|$|R
60|$|The gunners of {{this piece}} had been well trained. In a moment the boom was swung around, the cannon reloaded, and when Crab K fixed her nippers on the rudder of the Adamant, two more shot came down upon her. As in the first {{instance}} she <b>dipped</b> and <b>rolled,</b> but the ribs of her uninjured armour had scarcely sprung back into their places, before her nippers turned, and the rudder of the Adamant was broken in two, and the upper portion dragged from its fastenings then a quick backward jerk snapped its chains, and it was dropped into the sea.|$|R
30|$|Highwall mining {{systems have}} {{improved}} mining operations {{due to their}} safety and productivity. However, the application is restricted by coal seam conditions such as the <b>dip,</b> thickness, <b>roll,</b> split of the seam, the existence of faulting and folding, etc. It is difficult or almost impossible to apply the system into steeper dipping coal seams, over 15 °. Therefore, another type of system was developed, aimed at coal seams in the 16 °– 25 ° dip range. A high-powered auger machine, for use in seam dips of up to 23 °, was developed and introduced at a coal mine in Australia (Matsui et al. 2003).|$|R

[...] In Medicine, the characters are told, [...] "A <b>roll</b> <b>dipped</b> in human blood [...] [...] [...] can cure any consumption!" [...] though this promise proves false. Scholars have suggested that Lu Xun's family experience with traditional Chinese medicine was crucial in forming his psychology and personality.|$|R
60|$|The {{method of}} aiming was as novel as the bomb itself. In this process nothing {{depended}} on the eyesight of the gunner; the personal equation was entirely eliminated. The gun was so mounted that its direction was accurately indicated by graduated scales; there was an instrument which was acted upon by the <b>dip,</b> rise, or <b>roll</b> of the vessel, and which showed at any moment {{the position of the}} gun with reference to the plane of the sea-surface.|$|R
40|$|The {{sol-gel process}} is a method for the {{preparation}} of inorganic materials and organically modified ceramics by "soft" chemistry. The possibility of adjusting the rheology of intermediates leads to products for coating procedures. As coating techniques <b>dip,</b> spin-on, spray, <b>roll,</b> and others are possible. Different applications for glasses are possible: to improve the surface properties of glass (e. g. strength) and to generate special effects or functions (optical, chemical reactivity, sensitive, protective, and others). A general survey over coating problems is given and some special applications are discussed. (ISC...|$|R
5000|$|Poison darts are {{prepared}} by the Chocó by first impaling a frog {{on a piece of}} wood. [...] By some accounts, the frog is then held over or roasted alive over a fire until it cries in pain. Bubbles of poison form as the frog's skin begins to blister. The dart tips {{are prepared}} by touching them to the toxin, or the toxin can be caught in a container and allowed to ferment. Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous. Other accounts say that a stick siurukida ("bamboo tooth") is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs. This causes the frog to perspire profusely on its back, which becomes covered with a white froth. The darts are <b>dipped</b> or <b>rolled</b> in the froth, preserving their lethal power for up to a year.|$|R
5000|$|..... called rana de veneno by the Spanish, {{about three}} inches long, yellow on the back, with very large black eyes... {{those who use}} poison catch the frogs {{in the woods and}} confine them in a hollow cane where they {{regularly}} feed them until they want the poison, when they take the unfortunate reptile and pass a pointed piece of wood down his throat and out of one of his legs. This torture makes the poor frog perspire very much, especially on the back, which becomes covered in a white froth; this is the most powerful poison that he yields, and in this they <b>dip</b> or <b>roll</b> the tips of their arrows, which will preserve their destructive power for a year. Afterwards, below this white substance, appears a yellow oil, which is carefully scraped off, and retains its deadly influence for four to six months, according to the goodness (as they say) of the frog. By this means, from one frog sufficient poison is obtained for about fifty arrows." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{became a}} {{positive}} duty {{to look at}} the Packet preparing to go across; aboard of which, the people newly come down by the rail- road were hurrying in a great fluster. The crew had got their tarry overalls on - and one knew what THAT meant - not to mention the white basins, ranged in neat little piles of a dozen each, behind the door of the after-cabin. One lady as I looked, one resigning and far-seeing woman, took her basin from the store of crockery, as she might have taken a refreshment-ticket, laid herself down on deck with that utensil at her ear, muffled her feet in one shawl, solemnly covered her countenance after the antique manner with another, and on the completion of these preparations appeared by the strength of her volition to become insensible. The mail-bags (O that I myself had the sea-legs of a mail-bag!) were tumbled aboard; the Packet left off roaring, warped out, and made at the white line upon the bar. One <b>dip,</b> one <b>roll,</b> one break of the sea over her bows, and Moore's Almanack or the sage Raphael could not have told me more of the state of things aboard, than I knew.|$|R
60|$|Miss Fennimore bade Robert compose {{his voice}} to pray aloud, and what he read tranquillized all except Mervyn, who {{understood}} this to mean the worst, and burst away to sit cowering in suspense over his fire. Miss Fennimore then offered Bertha a morsel of <b>roll</b> <b>dipped</b> in port wine, but fasting and agitation had really produced a contraction of {{the muscles of the}} throat, and the attempt failed. Bertha was dreadfully terrified, and Phoebe could hardly control herself, but she was the only person unbanished by Miss Fennimore. Even Robert's distress became too visible for the absolute calm by which the governess hoped to exhaust the hysteria while keeping up vitality by outward applications of warmth and stimulants, {{and from time to time}} renewing the endeavour to administer nourishment.|$|R

40|$|The {{zinc coated}} steel sheet has been mostly used for {{automobile}} and other industries {{because of its}} high corrosion resistance. This paper deals {{with the development of}} new ceramics support roll used for a continuous galvanizing pot to manufacture stable galvanizing steel sheet. Usually stainless steel rolls coated by tungsten carbide are used to support and stabilize the strip in a continuous galvanizing pot, which is filled with molten zinc. However, corrosion and abrasion arise on the roll surface only in a few weeks, and causing the deterioration of quality of plating. Although developing all-ceramics rolls is most desirable, risk of fracture has to be reduced when the ceramic <b>roll</b> <b>dips</b> into molten metal. In this paper, therefore, how to reduce the thermal stress is considered when the ceramic rolls are installed in molten metal using finite volume method and finite element method. The usefulness of silicon nitride having extremely high conductivity is also discussed...|$|R
6000|$|What retort Isabel {{might have}} made cannot now be known, for she was arrested at this moment by a rumor amongst the {{passengers}} that they were coming to the Long Sault Rapids. Looking forward she saw the tossing and flashing of surges that, to the eye, are certainly as threatening as the rapids above Niagara. The steamer had already passed the Deplau and the Galopes, and they had thus had a foretaste of whatever pleasure or terror {{there is in the}} descent of these nine miles of stormy sea. It is purely a matter of taste, about shooting the rapids of the St. Lawrence. The passengers like it better than the captain and the pilot, to guesses by their looks, and the women and children like it better than the men. It is no doubt very thrilling and picturesque and wildly beautiful: the children crow and laugh, the women shout forth their delight, as the boat enters the seething current; great foaming waves strike her bows, and brawl away to the stern, while she <b>dips,</b> and <b>rolls,</b> and shoots onward, light as a bird blown by the wind; the wild shores and islands whirl out of sight; you feel in every fibre the career of the vessel. But the captain sits in front of the pilothouse smoking with a grave face, the pilots tug hard at the wheel; the hoarse roar of the waters fills the air; beneath the smoother sweeps of the current you can see the brown rocks; as you sink from ledge to ledge in the writhing and twisting steamer, you have a vague sense that all this is perhaps an achievement rather than an enjoyment. When, descending the Long Sault, you look back up hill, and behold those billows leaping down the steep slope after you, [...] "No doubt," [...] you confide to your soul, [...] "it is magnificent; but it is not pleasure." [...] You greet with silent satisfaction the level river, stretching between the Long Sault and the Coteau, and you admire the delightful tranquillity of that beautiful Lake St. Francis into which it expands. Then the boat shudders into the Coteau Rapids, and down through the Cedars and Cascades. On the rocks of the last lies the skeleton of a steamer wrecked upon them, and gnawed at still by the white-tusked wolfish rapids. No one, they say, was lost from her. [...] "But how," [...] Basil thought, [...] "would it fare with all these people packed here upon her bow, if the Banshee should swing round upon a ledge?" [...] As to Isabel, she looked upon the wrecked steamer with indifference, as did all the women; but then they could not swim, and would not have to save themselves. [...] "The La Chine's to come yet," [...] they exulted, [...] "and that 's the awfullest of all!" ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{calculated}} the mineralogical {{properties of the}} Earth 2 ̆ 7 s mantle and the lithological units constituting the subducting oceanic slabs within {{a wide range of}} P–T conditions within the CaO–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system, except for the basalt top-layer of a slab, for which the system is extended to include Na 2 O. The mineralogical data are then converted, using the appropriate P–V–T relations, to bulk densities. The calculated adiabatic density vs. depth profile of the mantle between 200 and 725 km depths is in good agreement with geophysical and experimental data. The density data of the different compositional units are combined with {{calculated the}}rmal structures for a variety of slab–mantle systems to construct equilibrium density profiles as a function of depth. The mean equilibrium densities of the slabs within the transition zone (400 – 660 km depth) are found to be ∼ 0. 04 – 0. 05 g/cm 3 greater than those of the ambient mantle within the same depth interval. For the entire upper mantle, density differences between slabs and ambient mantle are slightly less, but the slabs still remain denser than the latter. At 670 km depth, slabs have lower density than the ambient lower mantle because of the commencement of perovskite forming reactions within the mantle, and displacements of these reaction boundaries to higher pressures within the slabs as a consequence of their negative P–T slopes. If perovskite forming reactions within slabs are hindered for kinetic sluggishness, then neutral buoyancy would be achieved when the slabs have penetrated ∼ 100 km into the lower mantle. However, using the available data on the kinetics of spinel to perovskite plus periclase reaction, we conclude that the reaction would go to completion in a Peru-type young slab (41 Myr), and very likely also in a Tonga-type old slab (110 Myr), before these penetrated 100 km into the lower mantle. Thus, slabs should always remain negatively buoyant, and therefore continue to subduct through the lower mantle once it penetrates through the 660 km discontinuity. Despite a negative buoyancy force, a slab could deflect {{at the top of the}} lower mantle (660 km) because of factors resisting subduction, namely viscosity jump, low <b>dip</b> angle, slab <b>roll</b> back, and metastable persistence of olivine in cold slabs. If published scale model experiments represent realistic approximations of the factors affecting plate subduction, then according to our density data, any slab with a dip angle of ≤ 40 – 50 ° would bend at the 660 km discontinuity if there is a viscosity jump of at least by a factor of ∼ 10 and trench migration. The basalt top-layer of a slab is denser than other slab components and the ambient mantle at all depths to 660 km, and therefore should continue to sink into the lower mantle, especially if a slab directly penetrates the 660 km barrier, instead of peeling off in the transition zone to form a “perched eclogite” or “piclogite” layer, as previously proposed. The harzburgite layer, which is sandwiched between denser basalt and lherzolite layers, faces greater resistance to subduction, especially in a young slab, and thus could significantly contribute to the deformation of a slab near the 660 km discontinuity...|$|R
