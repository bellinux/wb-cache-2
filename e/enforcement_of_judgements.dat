" The European judicial area {{is regarded as the}} most progressive area of private law in the European Union. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam unification of regulation in this area has undergone remarkable development. The Council Regulation (EC) No. 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgements</b> in civil and commercial matters (regulation Brussels I) is the center {{of this work}}. The regulation Brussels I is the successor of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgements</b> in civil and commercial matters (Brussels Convention). Brussels Convention was the first general multilateral instrument on the recognition of judgements which directly regulated the jurisdiction of the Contracting states. The first part of this work concerns the object of the european civil procedural law, the origin of the Brussels Convention {{and the role of the}} Court of Justice of the European Communities. In the whole work is emphasis the importance of relevant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, particularly in the part about juridiction.

For this purpose it is essential to elaborate on the judicial structures {{and its impact on the}} <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> laws in the PRC. The court system as well as its size and performance, the prosecution system, the lawyer system, the jurisdiction and the arbitration system will be briefly discussed. Thereafter, the study focuses on the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>judgements</b> and arbitral awards in the PRC. The organization <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> and its procedure, laws and regulations in general will be addressed before the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>judgements</b> and arbitral awards will be investigated in detail. The investigation <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> judgments in the people’s courts of China is separated in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> domestic judgments and foreign judgments.

This {{publication}} is an {{output of}} the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation ([URL] Queensland University of Technology.

In a narrow sense it refers to whether a court has the authority to hear a case in relation to specific people and activities (subject matter) but in a broader sense it also encompasses what law should be applied (choice of law), whether the court is a suitable court to hear the case (choice of court) and the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgements.</b> The notion of jurisdiction provides a tool for efficiently managing litigation and traditionally has been based upon notions of connection to a particular territory. In the global transnational world of the Internet the concept of jurisdiction has struggled to find a sensible meaning. 1 Does jurisdiction lie everywhere that the Internet runs or is it more narrowly defined?

According to the title of regulation this tesis is diveded in several parts explaining the key elements of developing the other maxime of the EU-free movement of judgements. First part includes the general fundamentals for determination of jurisdiction in cases with transborder element which is essential for aplication of this regulation as a part of legislation on international private law.

Second part and third part turn to recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in order to ensure the situation when "the declaration that a judgement is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion on any of the ground for non-enforcement provided by this Regulation". The last part contents future trend in this sphere which can be seen from application of other regulation (European enforcement order, European order for payment procedure) giving rise to rapid and simple mechanism in specific cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the rules of jurisdiction applicable to the cases arising from contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts). Considering the elements of foreign origin that often affect this type of contracts, and the lack of a global agreement regarding international jurisdiction and recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgements,</b> the objectives pursued by the author are:- identification of rules of jurisdiction applicable to the cases arising from e-contracts,- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. At European Union level, according to the provisions of Brussels I Regulation, as a general rule, actions against a person domiciled in a Member State shall be brought to the courts of that State. According to the same Regulation, cases resulting from a contractual relationship may be decided by the courts of the place of performance of the contractual obligation. In lack of specific jurisdictional rules, the above rules apply to B 2 B e-contracts. In the case of B 2 C e-contracts, the consumer can bring proceedings either before the courts of the Member State of his domicile or before the courts of the Member State of the defendant’s domicile. The consumer can only be sued in the Member State of his domicile. The rules protecting the consumer apply if the trader ‘directs its activities’ to the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled. If the defendant is not domiciled in a Member State, the international jurisdiction is determined, in each Member State, according to its national rules of international private laws...|$|E
40|$|The key {{instrument}} {{providing for}} a worldwide regulation of international {{parental child abduction}} {{has long been the}} Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child.   The Convention has been in force since 1983 and has proved a phenomenal success. Within the European Union, the operation of the 1980 Convention has been modified by certain provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning Jurisdiction and the Recognition and <b>Enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judgements</b> in Matrimonial Matters and the Matters of Parental Responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No. 1347 / 2000.   The Regulation entered into force on 1 March 2005 and applies to child abduction cases between the EU Member States except for Denmark.   This regional instrument aims at creating even more ambitious rules on child abduction by imposing stricter obligations to assure the prompt return of a child. Despite the ambitious goal of strengthening the deterrence of child abduction within the borders of the Union, the new child abduction regime did not receive a warm welcome by commentators. The thesis aims at critically evaluating the evolution of the new intra-EU child abduction regime, and examining to what extent the European Union complied with its standards of good legislative drafting during the negotiations on the Brussels II bis Regulation.   It also seeks to demonstrate that there was no real legal need for the involvement of the European Union in the area of child abduction, and tightening the 1980 Hague Convention return mechanism. Not less importantly, the thesis aspires to reveal how effectively the new return mechanism operates and what are the points of concern in respect to the functioning of the new child abduction scheme.

40|$|This {{research}} {{faces the}} problematic of the authentic instrument drawn up formally by public notaries as a suitable enforcement instrument, especially {{related to their}} 'enforcement in natura' or their specific performance under the scope of national and European legislation. Although the authentic instrument is a well known enforcement instrument in civil law countries due to the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judgements</b> in civil and commercial matters (modified by the Council Regulation (EC) 44 / 2001, of 22 December 2000) the authentic instrument has gained importance and could well play in the future an important role. It is essential not to forget that under {{the scope of the}} Brussels Convention a document which has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic and is enforceable in one Contracting State shall be enforceable in the State in which enforcement is sought. Therefore the authentic instrument can be enforced in a country in which these instruments are unknown or even that they do not allow their enforcement, when claim of specific performance is being seeked. As a result, it is our duty to establish whether in the civil law countries a common 'ratione materiae' for the authentic instruments does exist and if this enables us to speak of a 'Common European Authentic Instrument'. Therefore main interest lies in the compared study of the different forms of public notaries as well as their capacity of drawing up enforceable instrument in Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria under national legislation. Throughout the above mentioned countries different legal situations are to be taken into account, but they all allow the enforcement for a claim of payment. On the other hand Germany, Austria, Portugal do allow the specific performance, but in France, Italy and Spain this is not the case. Therefore is it possible to modify or reform the legislations or are we in front of an unavoidable obstacle. At this stage {{we should point out that}} in recent times a discussion towards reintroducing specific performance as a remedy has been put forward and adopted by some legislators. Last but not least, special attention is also payed to the challenges that the European Notaries are and will be facing in the so called European Integration Process and their possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with how jurisdiction is allocated in private EC competition law disputes which have connections {{with more than one}} country.   The question when the English court is entitled to refuse recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> a foreign judgment, which misapplies or neglects EC competition law, is duly examined as well.   Much of the law which provides the framework for the resolution of such disputes is derived from international legal sources, as a consequence of which English law is very similar to or the same as the law of other countries in Europe. The thesis comprises four main parts.   The first part introduces the sources that are relevant for jurisdiction and judgments in relation to EC competition law claims.   The second part considers the potential jurisdiction problems in antitrust claims and specifies the bases upon which the English courts may exercise jurisdiction in private proceedings arising under EC competition law.   The thesis’ third part focuses on questions related to the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals in EC competition law claims and the jurisdiction of English courts in proceedings ancillary to arbitration in relation to those claims.   The fourth part of the work is an analysis of the issue related to recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>judgements</b> in relation to EC competition law claims. The study shows that as a result <b>of</b> the decentralised <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> EC competition law, the private international law rules, related to jurisdiction and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign judgments, have a vital role to play if EC competition and law is to be enforced effectively and fulfil its economic function adequately.

40|$|My {{task is to}} come up with {{a theory}} of {{cooperation}} and, then, apply that theory to a particular historical case. The historical case I discuss Is the rise and decline of social order in medieval Iceland; the so-called Commonwealth period. The Commonwealth experience poses two main questions; first, how did the Commonwealth emerge, and, second, why did it break down. 	I begin by discussing the concepts of reciprocity and cooperation, and then offer an evolutionary theory of cooperation. Next, I put the theory to the test of actually explaining the rise of the Commonwealth’s institutional structure. I find that the theory is highly informative in application and able to account for Iceland’s institutional structure. Reciprocal behavior on the part of the Icelander’s initiated and created the cooperative institutional system. The keys to the stability of the system are found in the encouragement of reciprocical behavior, where the future repeated engagements are important enough to discourage defections. The Commonwealth was a decentralized structure, based mostly on voluntary cooperation, and <b>enforcements</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgements</b> were private. 	Along with expanding population, the Commonwealth chieftains position as arbitrators and owners of churches strengthened their position with respect to their followers. As time went by they realized the advantage of their privileged status and combined the sale of legal and religious services for their own benefit. By the last decade of the eleventh century the chieftains were able to use their position to introduce the tithe, obligating farmers to pay a tax to the chieftains and the Church, of one percentile of their wealth. In essence, rent-seeking (defection) became more profitable for the chieftains than long-term reciprocial behavior. Reciprocity, fruitful in establishing Iceland’s institutional structure, lost its importance and such behavior diminished. The tied sales of legal and religious services established the chieftains as local monopolies, as minimal states. These minimal states now competed for more territory, and population, and, most importantly, more chieftaincies and churches. The minimal states became fewer and fewer as the surviving ones triumphed in their advancements. Through the struggle for wealth and power the chieftains mostly killed each other and by 1250 only few chiefdoms and even fewer chieftains survived.
