500|$|In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela {{announced}} that he was [...] "retiring from retirement" [...] and retreating from public life, remarking, [...] "Don't call me, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> you." [...] Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.|$|E
500|$|According to a diary entry made by John Roberts of Paradise, Utah in 1902, Joseph Smith {{gave the}} White Horse Prophecy in early May 1843, {{during the period}} in which the Latter Day Saints were {{headquartered}} in Nauvoo, Illinois. [...] Smith is recorded as saying that the Mormons [...] "will go to the Rocky Mountains and will be a great and mighty people established there, which <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> the White Horse of peace and safety." [...] Adding that [...] "I shall never go there" [...] and predicting continued persecution by enemies of the church, Smith reportedly said that [...] "You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. [...] It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber.... I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse who will combine in its defense." [...] Smith additionally said, according to the diary, that the Mormons would send missionaries to [...] "gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God." [...] Roberts' account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility [...] "knows that [...] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it." [...] He is also reported to have said that a temple which the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in Jackson County, Missouri [...] "will be built in this generation." ...|$|E

2500|$|The priest quietly says several prayers here, before {{receiving}} Communion. The {{first is}} {{said in a}} low voice while taking up the Host onto the paten. [...] The second of them, spoken three times in a slightly audible voice, while the priest holds the Host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right, is based on : [...] "Lord, I am not worthy...." [...] Then, after having reverently consumed the Host, he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting : [...] "What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? I will take the chalice of salvation; and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> upon the name of the Lord." [...] immediately adding : [...] "Praising <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once a {{specific}} word {{has been found}} as an ELS, it is natural {{to see if that}} word is part of a longer ELS consisting of multiple words. Code proponents Haralick and Rips have published an example of a longer, extended ELS, which reads, [...] "Destruction <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> you; cursed is Bin Laden and revenge is to the Messiah" [...] (though the Hebrew, using appositives in place of to be, lacking helper verbs, and employing definite articles less frequently, would entail far fewer words than the English phrasing).|$|E

2500|$|The controller, {{who could}} not see the runway due to the fog, {{initially}} responded with [...] "OK" [...] (terminology which is nonstandard), which reinforced the KLM captain's misinterpretation that they had takeoff clearance. The controller's response of [...] "OK" [...] to the co-pilot's nonstandard statement that they were [...] "now at takeoff" [...] was likely due to his misinterpretation that they were in takeoff position and ready to begin the roll when takeoff clearance was received, but not in the process of taking off. The controller then immediately added [...] "stand by for takeoff, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> you", indicating that he had not intended the clearance to be interpreted as a takeoff clearance.|$|E
2500|$|The twins {{approached}} {{the body of}} the Giant and saw that he was dead. [...] The younger brother removed the Giant's scalp as proof. [...] Around his body lay many chips of flint from his armor. [...] The twins hurled the flint {{in each of the four}} directions, saying, [...] "From now on the people of the earth shall use you." [...] Then the older brother said to the young brother, [...] "I will call you , He Who Cuts Life Out of the Enemy." [...] The younger brother then said to his older brother, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> you , Monster Slayer. [...] It is the name by which you shall always be known." [...] Then the two brothers climbed back to the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain where they had landed after descending from the sky, and each sang a song in praise of their father, Jóhonaaʼéí, the Sun, as he neared the end of his journey across the sky. [...] Then they rested for the night.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia wrote a {{concurrence}} (which {{was joined}} by Justice Clarence Thomas), where he agreed that the case had to be reversed but held that the Court had not gone far enough, [...] "If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) all challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or Flast should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. Flast is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing." [...] He said the problem was because [...] "We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>call</b> 'Wallet Injury' and 'Psychic Injury.' ...Psychic Injury...has {{nothing to do with}} the plaintiff's tax liability. Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer’s mental displeasure that money extracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner. ...this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated. ...We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III." [...] Scalia wrote [...] "We had an opportunity today to erase this blot on our jurisprudence , but instead have simply smudged it." ...|$|E
