2500|$|Early ampelographical {{research}} into Sangiovese begun in 1906 {{with the work}} of Girolamo Molon. Molon discovered that the Italian grape known as [...] "Sangiovese" [...] was actually several [...] "varieties" [...] of clones which he broadly classified as Sangiovese Grosso and Sangiovese Piccolo. The Sangiovese Grosso family included the clones growing in the Brunello region as well as the clones known as Prugnolo Gentile and Sangiovese di Lamole that was grown in the Greve in Chianti region. The Sangiovese Grosso, according to Molon, produced the highest quality wine, while the varieties in the Sangiovese Piccolo family, which included the majority of clones, produced wine of a lesser <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality.</b> In the late 20th century, research by the Italian government and Chianti Classico Consorizo discovered that some of the best producing clones, from a wine quality perspective, came from the Emilia-Romagna region where they are today being propagated under the names R24 and T19.|$|E
2500|$|As well as reef-building {{organisms and}} the thick-shelled Lamellibranchia {{mentioned}} above, the Burgsvik beds are also {{of interest to}} micropalæontologists. Their quiet tectonic history — with the depth of burial never exceeding 200metres, and [...] "no thermal maturation" [...] occurring (Jeppsson 1983) — means that organic material is preserved relatively unscathed, to a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> barely rivalled anywhere else on earth for rocks of this age - indeed, the preservation is equivalent to that expected from the Tertiary (Sherwood-Pike and Gray 1985). Dissolution of the rocks in hydrofluoric acid leaves the organic matter unscathed, and putative fungi (Ornatifilum) and fæcal pellets have been unearthed (Sherwood-Pike and Gray 1985), as well as supposed euglenids (Gray and Boucot 1989): the latter being of particular interest as not one other fossil euglenid is known. A lack of marine macrofossils in plant-rich beds suggests that large grazers or predators may have been absent, perhaps because water depths were so shallow - this may have aided fossil preservation (Gray et al. 1974).|$|E

Event channels operating in CAN-based subnetworks typically with strong timing behavior may support hard temporal and reliability attributes whereas channels interconnecting these subnetworks using wireless networks support weaker timing attributes. 1...|$|R
