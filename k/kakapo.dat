5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing <b>kakapo</b> habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the <b>kakapo</b> until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate <b>kakapo.</b> In the late 19th century, the <b>kakapo</b> became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the <b>kakapo</b> population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, a <b>Kakapo</b> Recovery {{programme}} {{was developed}} and a <b>Kakapo</b> Recovery Group established to implement it. The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of {{the plan was to}} relocate all the remaining <b>kakapo</b> to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish <b>kakapo</b> without rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Hauturu/Little Barrier, Codfish and Mana. Sixty-five <b>kakapo</b> (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new <b>kakapo</b> sanctuaries, Chalky Island (Te Kakahu) and Anchor Island. The entire <b>kakapo</b> population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All <b>kakapo</b> on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, seven <b>kakapo</b> were {{transferred}} to Little Barrier Island, {{in an attempt to}} establish a successful breeding programme. <b>Kakapo</b> were last on the island in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} parrots, <b>kakapos</b> {{have a variety}} of calls. As well as the booms (see below for a recording) and chings of their mating calls, they will often loudly skraark to {{announce}} their location to other birds.|$|R
50|$|While {{on their}} travels they also meet many animals that don't board the island {{such as an}} Indian water buffalo, a {{dromedary}} camel, sea turtles, butterflies, wildebeests, a sea lion, dugongs, a great white shark, budgerigars, and a community of <b>kakapos.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} that in pre-Polynesian times, the <b>kakapo</b> was New Zealand's third most common bird {{and it was}} widespread on all three main islands. However, the <b>kakapo</b> population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts {{have been made to}} prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the <b>Kakapo</b> Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native birds were declining, and began catching and moving <b>kakapo</b> and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 <b>kakapo</b> to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent <b>kakapo</b> population within 6 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, three <b>kakapo</b> {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little Barrier Island {{north-east}} of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the <b>kakapo</b> were never seen again. In 1912, three <b>kakapo</b> were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, {{despite the presence of}} feral cats for part of the intervening period.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s, {{large numbers}} of mustelids (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were {{released}} in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the <b>kakapo.</b> Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the <b>kakapo</b> for food, and caused the extinction {{of some of its}} preferred plant species. The <b>kakapo</b> was reportedly still present near the head of the Whanganui River as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a <b>kakapo</b> in the North Island being a single bird caught in the Kaimanawa Ranges by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The beak of the <b>kakapo</b> {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the <b>kakapo</b> {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as <b>kakapo</b> food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The <b>kakapo</b> has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The <b>kakapo</b> is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} in {{the decline of the}} <b>kakapo</b> was the arrival of humans. Māori {{folklore}} suggests that the <b>kakapo</b> was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the <b>kakapo</b> for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the <b>kakapo</b> was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for <b>kakapo.</b> Although the <b>kakapo</b> was extinct {{in many parts of the}} islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The <b>kakapo</b> (Māori: <b>kākāpō</b> {{or night}} parrot), Strigops habroptila (Gray, 1845), also called owl parrot, is {{a species of}} large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family Strigopoidea, endemic to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Young birds {{indulge in}} play fighting, and one bird will often lock {{the neck of}} another under its chin. The <b>kakapo</b> is curious by nature and {{has been known to}} {{interact}} with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some <b>kakapo,</b> which have distinct personalities.|$|E
5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, sightings of <b>kakapo</b> were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen <b>kakapo.</b> The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the <b>kakapo</b> was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of <b>kakapo</b> were becoming scarce.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the <b>Kakapo</b> Recovery Programme {{presented}} a new management {{plan that would}} run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals {{can be expected to}} result in inbreeding depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the <b>kakapo</b> population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the New Zealand Wildlife Service was {{established}} and began making regular expeditions {{to search for}} the <b>kakapo,</b> mostly in Fiordland and what is now the Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a <b>kakapo</b> was caught and released in the Milford Sound catchment area in Fiordland. Six more <b>kakapo</b> were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the aviaries of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near Masterton in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the <b>kakapo,</b> indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>kakapo</b> has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the <b>kakapo</b> is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>kakapo</b> is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The <b>kakapo</b> does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, <b>kakapo</b> breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E
5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was {{apparent}} that cats killed <b>kakapo</b> at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed <b>kakapo</b> were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E
5|$|The <b>kakapo</b> is {{primarily}} nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees {{or on the}} ground {{during the day and}} moves around its territories at night.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The <b>kakapo</b> breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase <b>kakapo</b> breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the <b>kakapo</b> {{might be related to}} the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E
5|$|The ground-dwelling <b>kakapo,</b> {{which is}} the world's only flightless parrot, has remiges which are shorter, rounder and more symmetrically vaned than those of parrots capable of flight; these flight {{feathers}} also contain fewer interlocking barbules near their tips.|$|E
5|$|The <b>kakapo</b> {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the <b>kakapo</b> feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the <b>kakapo</b> was among their prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} musculature of the <b>kakapo</b> is also {{modified by}} flightlessness. The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that {{is associated with}} the large crop.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the <b>kakapo</b> differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The <b>kakapo</b> has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female <b>kakapo</b> will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male <b>kakapo</b> will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|The female <b>kakapo</b> lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per {{breeding}} cycle, {{with long}} intervals between laying of {{first and second}} eggs. She nests on the ground {{under the cover of}} plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. <b>Kakapo</b> eggs usually hatch within 30days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6months.|$|E
5|$|The forests were {{dominated}} by birds, {{and the lack of}} mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, <b>kakapo,</b> weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young <b>kakapo</b> is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless <b>kakapo,</b> with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
