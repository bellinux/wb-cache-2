5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as <b>in</b> <b>Yesterday,</b> Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

500|$|On 6 August 2010, it was {{announced}} that Carrick would miss the start of the 2010–11 season {{as a result of an}} ankle injury sustained in United's final pre-season game against a League of Ireland XI. However, two days later, he played 79 minutes of United's 3–1 victory over Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield. Manager Sir Alex Ferguson claimed, [...] "He came <b>in</b> <b>yesterday,</b> says he was fit, wanted to train, trained, and wanted to play." [...] On 3 March 2011, he signed a new three-year deal keeping him at the club until the end of the 2013–14 season. Carrick's first significant display of the season came in a 1–0 away win over Chelsea in the Champions League on 6 April. He played a vital pass in the move that led to Wayne Rooney's goal and was praised for his performance.|$|E

500|$|Like in The Kampung Boy, {{the scenes}} <b>in</b> <b>Yesterday</b> and Today are {{presented}} in great detail. [...] Lat shows the children playing with items constructed from simple items found in the household and nature. [...] He also illustrates the toys' schematics. [...] He compares the games with their modern counterparts, lamenting the loss of creativity in modern youths. [...] Other comments on societal changes are in the book. [...] A child is taking a swimming lesson in a pool, intently watched by his parents who have a maid in tow with various items in her hands. [...] While the parents gesticulate wildly at their son, the lifeguard and instructor calmly sit by the pool, watching the boy's smooth progress. [...] This scene is contrasted with Lat's own experience {{at the hands of}} his father, who casually tosses the terrified boy into a river, letting him either swim or flounder. [...] Such details, according to Muliyadi, invoke a yearning for the past and help readers [...] "better appreciate [...] cartoons".|$|E
