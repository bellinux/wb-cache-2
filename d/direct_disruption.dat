The probable occurrence of such major population shifts is alarming and likely to have significant implications not only for affected individuals and communities, but also for organizations, industries, and entire economies. Implications for organizations result from two interrelated disruptions in their business environment which might create {{the necessity of a}} geographical relocation of organizational activities. These are: (1) <b>direct</b> <b>disruptions</b> through climate change impacts, for instance through extreme weather events, and (2) indirect disruptions through changes in habitable zones, population moves and a resulting transfer of markets and economic activity elsewhere.

Experiments with the rat barrel cortex have shown that changes {{in the pattern of}} sensory activity can alter configuration of cortical receptive fields; if a particular whisker gets directed stimulus, the cortex will reflect the <b>directed</b> stimulus. <b>Disruptions</b> in sensory maps reflect actual discontinuities in the receptor sheet, and evoked and spontaneous neural activity instruct variable features of sensory maps.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{scientific}} {{evidence suggests that}} human-induced climate change will bring about large-scale environmental changes such as sea-level rise and coastal flooding, extreme weather events and agricultural disruptions. The speed and extent of these changes and the expected impacts on social and corresponding economic and industrial systems are now moving {{to the forefront of}} debates. In this paper, we argue that climate change will lead to significant disruptions to firms which might ultimately create the necessity of a geographical shift of firm and industrial activities away from regions highly affected by climate change. Such a shift might become necessary due to (1) <b>direct</b> <b>disruptions</b> through climate change impacts on firm operations, for instance through droughts, floods, or sea level rise, and due to (2) disruptions in a firm 2 ̆ 7 s supplier, buyer or resource base that lead to flow-on effects and adverse consequences for a firm. We propose a framework for integrating firm relocation decisions into firm adaptive responses to climate change. The framework consists of three assessment steps: the level of risk from climate change impacts at a firm 2 ̆ 7 s location, the feasibility of relocation, and associated costs and benefits. We apply the framework to two case examples. The first case of electricity distribution firms in Victoria/Australia illustrates how the relocation (undergrounding) of cables could decrease the vulnerability of distribution networks to bushfires and the risk of electricity-caused fires, but would require significant investments. The second case of firms in the Australian pastoral industry points to geographic diversification of pastoral land holdings as possible adaptation option, but also to constraints in form of availability of suitable properties, ties to local communities, and adverse impacts on biodiversity. Implications for adaptation research and practice are outlined. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that neutrophil recruitment {{to the heart}} following myocardial infarction (MI) is enhanced in mice lacking 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD 1) that regenerates active glucocorticoid within cells from intrinsically inert metabolites. The present study aimed to identify the mechanism of regulation. In a mouse model of MI, neutrophil mobilization to blood and recruitment to the heart were higher in 11 β-HSD 1 -deficient (Hsd 11 b 1 (-) (/) (-)) relative to wild-type (WT) mice, despite similar initial injury and circulating glucocorticoid. In bone marrow chimeric mice, neutrophil mobilization was increased when 11 β-HSD 1 was absent from host cells, but not when absent from donor bone marrow-derived cells. Consistent with a role for 11 β-HSD 1 in 'host' myocardium, gene expression of a subset of neutrophil chemoattractants, including the chemokines Cxcl 2 and Cxcl 5, was selectively increased in the myocardium of Hsd 11 b 1 (-) (/) (-) mice relative to WT. SM 22 α-Cre <b>directed</b> <b>disruption</b> of Hsd 11 b 1 in smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes {{had no effect on}} neutrophil recruitment. Expression of Cxcl 2 and Cxcl 5 was elevated in fibroblast fractions isolated from hearts of Hsd 11 b 1 (-) (/) (-) mice post MI and provision of either corticosterone or of the 11 β-HSD 1 substrate, 11 -dehydrocorticosterone, to cultured murine cardiac fibroblasts suppressed IL- 1 α-induced expression of Cxcl 2 and Cxcl 5 These data identify suppression of CXCL 2 and CXCL 5 chemoattractant expression by 11 β-HSD 1 as a novel mechanism with potential for regulation of neutrophil recruitment to the injured myocardium, and cardiac fibroblasts as a key site for intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration during acute inflammation following myocardial injury...|$|R

The change of the air-sea interaction regime in hurricane conditions {{has been linked to}} the mechanism of <b>direct</b> <b>disruption</b> of the air-sea interface by pressure fluctuations working against the surface tension force. This can be achieved through the Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability. In order to investigate this mechanism, we have conducted a series of 3 D numerical experiments using a volume of fluid multiphase model. The experiments were initialized with either a flat interface or short wavelets and wind stress applied at the upper boundary of the air layer. The <b>direct</b> <b>disruption</b> of the air-water interface and formation of two-phase transition layer were observed in the numerical model under hurricane force wind. The vertical profiles of density and velocity in the transition layer were consistent with the regime of marginal stability, which permitted estimation of the lower limit on the drag coefficient under hurricane conditions. This limit was appreciably lower than the wave resistance law; though, it was gradually increasing with wind speed. The numerical experiments with imposed short wavelets demonstrated the tearing of wave crests, formation of water sheets and spume ejected into the air, smoothing of the water surface, as well as quasiperiodic structures on the top of wave crests resembling the Tollmien-Schlichting instability. This study can help in developing a framework for combining the effects of the two-phase environment with the contribution to the drag from waves...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that isolation of the inferior temporal cortex and medial temporal lobe from their cholinergic afferents results in a severe anterograde amnesia. To test this hypothesis directly, seven rhesus monkeys received a unilateral immunotoxic lesion of the cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain with an ipsilesional section of the fornix. In a second surgery, inferior temporal cortex was ablated in the opposite hemisphere. All animals were severely impaired at learning visual scenes and object-reward associations. The impairment in learning scenes was correlated with cholinergic cell loss in the basal forebrain, but not with generalized tissue damage. Two monkeys served as surgical controls with saline injection {{in place of the}} immunotoxin, but all other procedures the same, and were not as severely impaired as those with immunotoxic lesions. Previous work has shown that monkeys with bilateral section of the anterior temporal stem (white matter of the temporal lobe), amygdala and fornix show a severe new learning impairment, and provide a model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia. One effect of this combined ablation is to isolate inferior temporal cortex and medial temporal lobe from their cholinergic afferents, possibly in addition to a <b>direct</b> <b>disruption</b> of the hippocampal system. The results of the present study, then, provide a novel link between the mechanisms of medial temporal lobe amnesia and Alzheimer's disease in which the cholinergic basal forebrain shows pathology.

Increased sequencing to 240 × coverage revealed a proportionally higher number of integration sites. Clonal expansion of HBV-integrated hepatocytes was found specifically in tumor samples. We observe a diverse collection of genomic perturbations near viral integration sites, including <b>direct</b> gene <b>disruption,</b> viral promoter-driven human transcription, viral-human transcript fusion, and DNA copy number alteration.

Although several intracellular cascades participating in this functional dialogue have been identified {{over the last few}} decades, the molecular crosstalk between surface dopamine and glutamate NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling still remains poorly understood. Using a combination of single-molecule detection imaging and electrophysiology in live hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate here that dopamine D 1 receptors (D 1 Rs) and NMDARs form dynamic surface clusters in the vicinity of glutamate synapses. Strikingly, D 1 R activation or D 1 R/NMDAR <b>direct</b> interaction <b>disruption</b> decreases the size of these clusters, increases NMDAR synaptic content through a fast lateral redistribution of the receptors, and favors long-term synaptic potentiation.

Here, we describe that the peptide GKS 26 (GKSRIQRLNILNAKFAFNLYRVLKDQ), corresponding to the A domain of heparin cofactor II (HCII), ameliorates experimental septic shock. The peptide displays antimicrobial effects through <b>direct</b> membrane <b>disruption,</b> also at physiological salt concentration and {{in the presence of}} plasma and serum. Biophysical investigations of model lipid membranes showed the antimicrobial action of GKS 26 to be mirrored by peptide incorporation into, and disordering of, bacterial lipid membranes. GKS 26 furthermore binds extensively to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as its endotoxic lipid A moiety, and displays potent anti-inflammatory effects, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, for mice challenged with ip injection of LPS, GKS 26 suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduces vascular leakage and infiltration in lung tissue, and normalizes coagulation.

While most pathogens are host specific, the fusaria {{are able to}} infect both plants and animals. In 2004, an outbreak of Fusarium occurred in association with contact lens wear. Several species of Fusarium were involved but F. solani and F. oxysporum were most prominent. In this work, we have identified a MAP kinase (MAPK), highly similar to fmk 1 in F. oxysporum, belonging to the YERK 1 subfamily of extracellular regulated kinases. <b>Directed</b> <b>disruption</b> of fmk 1 in F. solani AFR 4 (FSSC 1) affected several aspects of fungal growth and pathogenicity. Colonies of AFR 4 „½fmk 1 displayed pigmented colony-like formation {{as opposed to the}} cottony-white diffuse growth observed with the wild-type strain. Mutants displayed changes in morphology and conidiation patterns with AFR 4 „½fmk 1 mutants producing increased amounts of macroconidia vs. microconidia. AFR 4 „½fmk 1 germ tube emergence was similar to that of wild-type AFR 4 and wet weight growth was equivalent but germinules were not able to sense nutrient in chemotropic assays. The disruption of fmk 1 increased spore surface hydrophobicity leading to a decrease in association with commercially available hydrogel contact lenses. FMK 1 did not affect unworn lens penetration in phosphate buffered saline as both wild-type and mutant strains were able to penetrate commercially available silicone hydrogel contact lenses. AFR 4 displayed increased penetration of silicone lenses and this is likely due to: increased spore/lens association, and the inability of AFR 4 „½fmk 1 macroconidia to germinate in phosphate buffered saline. Diminished invasive growth was also noted with disruption of fmk 1. Wild-type AFR 4 was detected throughout the eye after conidial microinjection while AFR 4 „½fmk 1 was limited to the vitreous fluid. The reduced invasive growth seen is attributed to the loss of chemotropism. The ability to sense and respond to the environment is essential for pathogenicity. MAPK has been deemed essential for plant pathogenicity and now, with its affect on chemotropism, appears to be necessary for animal pathogenicity.

In vivo, disruption of chromatin in the first 400 bp of the transcribed region of hsp 70 following heat shock is resistant to the transcriptional inhibitor α-amanitin. Disruption of chromatin farther downstream also occurs following activation but is sensitive to α-amanitin, suggesting that polymerase movement is needed to disrupt distal portions of the hsp 70 gene.

Arguably, the calcium ion contributes greatly to the delayed cell damage and death after TBI. A large, sustained influx of calcium into cells can initiate cell death signaling cascades, through activation of several degradative enzymes, such as proteases and endonucleases. However, a sustained level of intracellular free calcium is not necessarily lethal, but the specific route of calcium entry may couple calcium directly to cell death pathways. Other sources of calcium, such as intracellular calcium stores, can also contribute to cell damage. In addition, calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways in neurons may be perturbed following injury. These latter types of alterations may contribute to abnormal physiology in neurons that do not necessarily die after a traumatic episode. This review provides an overview of experimental evidence that has led to our current understanding of the role of calcium signaling in death and dysfunction following TBI...|$|R
