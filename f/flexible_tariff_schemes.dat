40|$|This paper aims at {{defining}} a dynamic and <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> structure for a distribution company {{that protects the}} retail consumers against the excessive fluctuations of the wholesales market prices. We propose a two-stage pricing scheme that sets in a first-stage a time-of-use tariff that is corrected later by a dynamic component once the real-time demand has been observed. A personalized <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> may be offered by a distribution company to each dynamic customer by allowing him to choose the appropriate robustness level {{expressed in terms of}} variability between the first- and the second-stage decisions. The arising limited recourse model has been tested on realistic test problems, by using a slight modification of a recently proposed interior point solution framework...|$|R

40|$|Network {{operators}} {{are looking for}} ways how to introduce a <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> for electricity transport and how such a tariff would look like. This has several reasons. The most important one is that the planned broad introduction of smart meters gives the opportunity to introduce such a tariff on a large scale. But also the expected developments in the future like an increase of distributed generation and an increase of consumers peak capacity because of a rise in electric vehicles and heat pumps make this subject an important issue for network operators. Also DELTA Netwerkbedrijf (DNWB), the network operator in the province Zeeland, is interested in how such a tariff can be designed. A <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> will replace the current capacity tariff, which {{is nothing more than a}} fixed amount per year. This project is executed for DNWB to find the possible characteristics of a <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> and to show how such a tariff could look like...|$|R

40|$|The {{liberalisation}} of the telecommunication {{sector has}} dispossessed regulators {{from the use}} of cross-subsidisation in order to achieve the universality goal. In a liberalised context, special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> represent one possible policy tool in order to increase the penetration rate. This paper focuses on the UK fixed home telephone network and analyses LUS and InContact <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> adopted by British Telecom (BT) in the 1990 s. Both schemes turned out to yield unsatisfactory results. This paper, after reviewing past literature on telephone access demand, uses an econometric approach to test whether such schemes were properly targeted to suit the characteristics of "un-phoned" households. The empirical analysis points out that some important socio-economic factors, rather than simply low income, are the major drivers of non-connection. The failure to take into account these and other factors discussed in the paper, has significantly contributed to the poor results of the two special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this context the UK experience provides a useful basis for discussion on the validity of policies aimed at promoting network good adoption via the introduction of special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> Universal service Home telephone network Special tariffs Probit model UK...|$|R

40|$|At {{least since}} the European {{guidelines}} for energy efficiency in 2006, Smart Metering {{has been an important}} module of today’s idea of a liberalized energy market. Since then, automated meter reading has not only become accustomed in industrial sectors but also more and more private households are being supplied with the new technology. With this publication the authors outline the transition from automated meter reading from an industry-based mechanism to an opportunity for private customers to increase energy efficiency and save costs by the use of <b>flexible</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Several chances go {{hand in hand with the}} new technology: consumers expect an increase in energy efficiency through a better consumption control and system operators intend to optimize their distribution grid’s operation. Supported by this theory, a field study conducted in a small German town is being introduced, where a <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> along with a device to visualize consumption is used to integrate private customers into system operation. First outcomes indicate that private customers align their consumption significantly to an applied <b>flexible</b> <b>tariff</b> which shows that such a tariff can be used for improving the distribution process...|$|R

The feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> was to run for 15 years from November 2009, and applied to all household systems of up to 5 kW capacity and had a cap of 100MW of generating capacity and/or a $10 per annum increase in the average household electricity bill.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, feed-in tariffs have pushed the massive {{expansion}} of electricity from renewable energy sources in Germany. Between 1991 and 1999, feed-in tariffs were prescribed through the Electricity Feed-in Law – the so-called Stromeinspeisungsgesetz (SEG) – at relatively moderate rates. From 2000 onwards, the SEG {{was replaced by the}} Renewable Energy Sources Act – the so-called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) – with much higher subsidy rates. The rise in subsidies to renewable power generation under the EEG came along with a substantial increase in electricity prices provoking an intense public debate on the benefits of renewable energy promotion. In our regression analysis, we assess one popular justification for feed-in tariffs: the demand-side effect of induced innovation. We find that the innovation impact of the German feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> over {{the last two}} decades supports the positive innovation hypothesis. However, the inducement effect of the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> under the EEG is not significantly different from that of the SEG. Given the drastic cost of the EEG, we caution against the appraisal of the EEG feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> solely on the grounds of its impact on technological innovation...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} the {{utilization}} costs {{of free trade}} agreement (FTA) <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> To do that, we use shipment-level customs data on Thai imports, which identify not only firms, source country, and commodity but also <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> We propose several measures {{as a proxy for}} FTA utilization costs. The example includes the minimum amount of firm-level savings on tariff payments, i. e., trade values under FTA schemes multiplied by the tariff margin, in all transactions. Consequently, the median costs for FTA utilization in 2008, for example, are estimated to be approximately US$ 2, 000 for exports from China, US$ 300 for exports from Australia, and US$ 1, 000 for exports from Japan.

40|$|The {{preference}} utilization ratio, i. e., {{the share}} of imports under preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> out of total imports, has been a popular indicator for measuring the usage of preferential tariffs vis-à-vis tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis. A crucial shortcoming of this measure is the data requirements, particularly for import value data classified by <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are not available in most countries. This study proposes an alternative measure for preferential tariff utilization, termed the "tariff exemption ratio. " This measure offers the unique advantage of needing only publicly available data, such as those provided by the World Development Indicators, for its computations. We can thus calculate this measure for most countries for an international comparison. Our finding is that tariff exemption ratios differ widely across countries, with a global average of approximately 50 %...|$|R
