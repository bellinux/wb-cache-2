Based on data from the VELS study 1 this leads in children to an estimated intake of 0. 0058 mg <b>formetanate</b> per kilogram body weight and, hence, to an exceeding of the acute reference dose (ARfD) for the active substance of 0. 005 mg per kilogram body weight by 15 percent.

Total disappearance of the parent compounds, 90 % mineralisation and toxicity reduction below the threshold (EC 50) have been attained with all pesticides tested.

40|$|The {{official}} control of foodstuffs {{of the federal}} state of Brandenburg has found residues of the pesticide <b>formetanate</b> in a sample of cucumbers from Spain at a level of 0. 13 mg/kg (maxi-mum residue level by law is 0. 05 mg/kg). The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has as-sessed whether the detected residue level is a health hazard for consumers. Based on various food consumption data, the Institute has estimated how much <b>formetanate</b> would be taken in by consumers through the consumption of cucumbers with this residue. The exposure assessment has shown that the acute reference dose (ARfD) for children is exceeded. The ARfD is defined as the amount of a substance in food which a consumer may ingest during one day (spread over one or several meals) without appreciable health risk. Yet, an exceedance of the acute reference dose on its own is not enough to conclude a health risk. In order to assess potential health risk, toxicologists rely on the margin of safety (MOS). The MOS indicates the margin between the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) obtained from animal experiments and the estimated amount of the substance taken in by consumers. In the case at hand, though the acute reference dose is exceeded, the margin of safety is wide enough so that the consumption of cucumbers with 0. 13 mg/kg <b>formetanate</b> residues is unlikely to be a health hazard – even for children. The estimation {{of the degree to which}} the acute reference dose is reached reveals whether a health hazard is possible. Yet even if the exhaustion of the complete reference dose does not constitute a health hazard, the product has to be removed from the market if maximum residue levels of pesticides have been exceeded...|$|E

Este trabalho foi realizado para verificar o efeito de acaricidas e inseticidas-acaricidas empregados em plantações de seringueira, e outros que teriam potencial para serem empregados contra insetos e ácaros considerados pragas dessa cultura, sobre E. concordis e N. anonymus. Utilizou-se o método {{residual}} de pulverização em superfície, recomendado como padrão pelo Grupo de Trabalho "Pesticidas e Artrópodes Benéficos", da Organização Internacional de Controle Biológico e Integrado de Plantas e Animais Nocivos/Seção Regional do Paleártico Oeste. Duas concentrações de cada um dos seguintes ingredientes ativos foram utilizadas: acefato, dicofol, endosulfan, <b>formetanate,</b> metomil, monocrotofós, óxido de fenbutatin e propargite. Uma das concentrações utilizadas foi uma média daquelas sugeridas pelos fabricantes para o controle de ácaros e insetos fitófagos presentes em outras culturas, uma vez que nenhum dos produtos testados tem registro para o uso em seringueira e a outra correspondeu à cerca de um terço da primeira. Endosulfan a 320 ppm, dicofol a 100 ppm e óxido de fenbutatin a 100 e 320 ppm foram inócuos a E. concordis, enquanto que endosulfan a 320 ppm e dicofol a 100 ppm foram inócuos a N. anonymus. Acefato, <b>formetanate</b> e monocrotofós, nas concentrações testadas, foram nocivos às duas espécies. Euseius concordis (Chant) and Neoseiulus anonymus (Chant & Baker) are predatory mites of {{the family}} Phytoseiidae commonly found on rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) in the State of Mato Grosso, in the mid-west Brazil. This work was conducted to verify the effect of acaricides and insecticides-acaricides occasionally used in rubber tree plantations, and other products {{that could be used}} against different pests (insects and mites) in this crop, on E. concordis and N. anonymus. The residual contact spray method in glass surface was used, which is recommended by the Working Group on "Pesticides and Benefic Arthropods" of the International Organization of Biologic and Integrated Control of Noxious Plants and Animals/Regional Section of the West Paleartic (IOBC/WPRS). Two concentrations of the following active ingredients were used: acephato, dicofofol, endosulfan, <b>formetanate,</b> metomil, monocrotophos, oxid of fenbutanin and propargit. For each product, one of the concentrations used was an average of the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers for the control of mites and phytophagous insects in other crops, since none of the tested products are registered for use on rubber tree. The other concentration corresponded to ca. a third of the former concentration. Endosulfan at 320 ppm, dicofol at 100 ppm and fenbutanin oxid at 100 and 320 ppm were harmless to E. concordis, while endosulfan at 320 ppm and dicofol at 100 ppm were harmless to N. anonymus.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{resistance}} to acaricides {{in a number of}} populations of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in New Zealand had been carried out. Natural genetic and cytoplasmic incompatibilities between populations were also investigated with a view to possible biological control of the pest. Facets of acaricide resistance that were studied included multi-resistance, cross-resistance, negatively correlated resistance and the inheritance of resistance. Chemicals used included an organophosphate representative (parathion-methyl), a carbamate (<b>formetanate),</b> an ungrouped compound (tricyclohexyltin hydroxide) and an organochlorine (dicofol). Cross-resistance was demonstrated between parathion-methyl and <b>formetanate</b> in five populations obtained from widely separate areas of New Zealand. The resistance to parathion of three strains was found to be inherited as a single dominant character and transmissible by both sexes. Cytoplasmic factors (or nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions) and minor genes were found to contribute slightly to the expression of total resistance. No resistance to tricyclohexyltin hydroxide (Plictran) and dicofol (Kelthane) was detected. High degrees of incompatibility (haploid egg lethality) were observed in the hybrids of crosses between the various populations. Chromosomal rearrangements in balanced, heterozygous conditions, in conjunction with the cytoplasm, were considered to be important factors determining the interpopulational sterilities. The interpopulational incompatibility phenomenon was found to be multi-factorial and not associated with the resistance factor. The egg mortalities of some backcross series which remained constantly high in spite of several crossings, implicated that the introduction of normal males to a resistant mite population in an enclosed area (e. g. in a glasshouse) might be a worthwhile proposition in the integrated control of spider mites. Backcross hybrids, on allowing to multiply randomly, were capable of forming new gene combinations, leading consequently to the formation of new strains which were genetically different from the original parents used in the backcross series...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996, use of {{pesticides}} in orchard crops has come under heavy scrutiny due to the new set of rules and standards for assessing the risks of pesticide exposure. In the state of Washington, this impacts an industry with an estimated farm gate value of $ 988 million and approximately 214, 400 acres of apple, pear, and cherry (WASS 2000). To date, the result of FQPA has been either an outright loss of pesticides (e. g., methyl parathion in 1998), restrictions affecting use patterns (e. g., chlorpyrifos restricted to pre-bloom use only in 1999 and <b>formetanate</b> hydrochloride restricted to use up to the bloom period, also in 1999), or restrictions on the amount that can be used (e. g., limits on azinphos-methyl imposed in 1998).

EPA is approving new pesticides for use, but these approvals often occur before scientists have the opportunity to determine how best to use the new products in IPM programs.
