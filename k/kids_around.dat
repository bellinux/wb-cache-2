But rather than doing {{stand-up}} on the mic or seeing how many words he can rhyme with Versaci, this 20-year-old tells wonderfully-detailed stories on I'm Serious about coming up when all the elements try to keep you down. But T.I.'s at his best when he uses his head and not his, well, head. Similarly, I'm Serious gets it done by talking about familiar hip hop topics (gats, girls and makin' green), but doing it in a way that somehow comes off as fresh and original." [...] Rhapsody writer Sam Chennault wrote [...] "The opening salvo from one of Southern hip-hop's most charismatic emcees, I'm Serious is more introspective and less bombastic than T.I.'s subsequent work. [...] "Still Ain't Forgave Myself" [...] and [...] "What Happened" [...] are surprisingly tender, though [...] "Dope Boyz" [...] and the Neptunes-produced [...] "What's Your Name" [...] set the stage for the emergence of T.I.'s playa/pusha persona." ...|$|E
