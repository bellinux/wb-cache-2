25|$|Many casual players use {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in layers of some type of {{adhesive}} tape (often <b>electrical</b> <b>tape),</b> which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother. This is {{commonly referred to as}} a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the tennis ball, to provide two different sides and make it easy to bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.|$|E
25|$|In {{informal}} games, {{either a}} rubber ball or tennis ball {{is used as}} an alternative. The rubber ball is not suitable for the variety of surfaces made use of in informal games; it is too bouncy on cement and concrete and barely bounces at all on grass or soil. An unmodified tennis ball is light, but it is incapable of gaining sufficient speed. By covering a tennis ball with <b>electrical</b> <b>tape,</b> the ball's weight and traction are increased, which in turn leads to greater bounce and speed. A tape ball {{can also be used}} to mimic a seaming cricket ball by adding an extra layer of tape around the circumference like a seam, the sides can be roughened to mimic conventional swing of a cricket ball. The tape ball is thus a sound compromise between safety and sincerity to the sport.|$|E
25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in <b>electrical</b> <b>tape</b> and is used in playing street cricket. This {{modification}} of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball {{that in recent years}} some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls. These balls are quite popular in South Asia where tape ball cricket {{is one of the most}} popular forms of the sport.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A PE/EPDM {{environment}} friendly blend was processed via a critical method to an elastic film backing imitating conventional PVC <b>electrical</b> insulation <b>tape.</b> The film backing was surface treated, {{coated with a}} pressure sensitive adhesive, dried, and unwound in sequence to become an <b>electrical</b> insulation <b>tape</b> for evaluation. The evaluation procedure was according to authoritative <b>electrical</b> insulation <b>tape</b> standard UL- 510. The general physical properties and the unique characteristics of samples, composed of different materials, were tested. PE/EPDM was qualified to meet most of the require-ments for UL- 510 except exposure to heat. Among other characteristics, exposure to cold test, breakdown voltage, and flame resistance of PE/EPDM were significant. Therefore, an {{environment friendly}} PE/EPDM <b>electrical</b> insulation <b>tape</b> is well suited to low temperature and room temperature environments...|$|R

25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as <b>electrical</b> <b>tape,</b> lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E
500|$|The Mullen {{family lived}} {{less than a}} block from Madison Square Garden, where Joe's father Tom was a {{longtime}} employee {{on the ice and}} maintenance staffs. Joe and his brothers often hung around the arena with their father, taking old sticks to play with. He began playing roller hockey at the age of five, playing in a concrete schoolyard and using a sanded down roll of <b>electrical</b> <b>tape</b> as a puck. The boys' schoolyard games served as a partial inspiration for New York Rangers' general manager, Emile Francis, to create the Metropolitan Junior Hockey Association in 1966. [...] Mullen did not learn to ice skate until he was ten years old, but at the age of 14 joined the Metropolitan association as one of the league's youngest players. [...] Mullen played four seasons in the league between 1971 and 1975. He scored 71 goals in 1973–74, then 182 points in 40 games the following season. Mullen's 110 goals in 1974–75 was 52 more than his nearest competitor.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{currently}} {{not unusual for}} the rim of a bodhran to be covered with <b>electrical</b> <b>tape,</b> either by the drum-maker or the owner. This both reduces [...] "edge-loading" [...] (where the vibrations in the skin hit the rim and bounce back {{toward the center of}} the drum), and dampens unwanted overtones, allowing for greater control of the drum's sound. <b>Electrical</b> <b>tape</b> is preferred because the adhesive is rubber-based and will stretch with the skin even after bonding to it, lessening the likelihood of bubbles and other changes in the tape occurring when the skin tension is changed by tuning or atmospheric conditions. Owners of lower quality drums, with thick and rough skins, may also choose to sand the skin very lightly to reduce the rasp when the tipper strikes the face of the drum. Many effects of these and other modifications to the drum-skin, especially high quality skins, can also be achieved through regular use of the drum over time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the reed}} has dried, the wires are {{tightened}} around the reed, which has shrunk after drying, or replaced completely. The lower part is sealed (a nitrocellulose-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks {{out through the}} bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). <b>Electrical</b> <b>tape</b> can also be used as a wrapping for amateur reed makers. The bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Turk's head"—it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{preliminary}} investigation at the site, police {{found that the}} device shared [...] "some characteristics with improvised explosive devices."

Just after 10a.m., the bomb squad used a small explosive filled with water to destroy the device as a precaution. MBTA Transit police Lieutenant Salvatore Venturelli told the media at the scene, [...] "This {{is a perfect example of}} our passengers taking part in homeland security." [...] He refused to describe the object in detail because of the ongoing investigation, responding only that [...] "It's not consistent with equipment that would be there normally."

In this work, the potential of using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in both imaging and force mapping (FM) modes to derive additional analytical information from PSAs is demonstrated. AFM has been used to illustrate differences in the ultrastructural and nanomechanical properties of three visually distinguishable commercial PSAs to first test the feasibility of using this technique. Subsequently, AFM was used to detect nanoscopic differences between three visually indistinguishable PSAs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{three new}} applications of {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Arsenic content was measured in rice and coffee samples. These results for the concentration of arsenic in rice and coffee independently verify {{the results of a}} similar FDA study. Direct comparisons of the arsenic content in different types of rice (i. e. black, brown, jasmine) indicated no correlation in the amount of arsenic and the type of rice. Additionally, the rice and coffee samples were cultivated in different locations throughout the world and results were analyzed to discern any trends between the amount of arsenic and the country of origin. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used to measure the trace elemental composition of various well-known brands of duct and <b>electrical</b> <b>tapes.</b> A new method derived from existing chemometric principles (principal components analysis) for identifying which elements vary the most between the brands of tape is described. The new method is applied to measurements collected from duct and <b>electrical</b> <b>tapes</b> and they are compared to one another. Pigments from a ship which sank off the coast of Texas in 1684 were recently recovered. ICP-MS was used to perform elemental analysis on these samples to identify the type of pigment. These pigments were suspected to be products for trade with natives in the new world. As was common at the time, the pigments were also suspected of adulteration (being cut with a cheaper product); they were analyzed for evidence of such a practice. ICP-MS {{is one of the most}} sensitive useful tools for elemental analysis. Knowing the exact composition of various samples using this technique can help scientists assist in setting new public safety standards in the present, provide new techniques for the future, and learn about life in the past. The three applications highlight the versatility of ICP-MS to a broadening number of different scientific disciplines...|$|R

2500|$|Whilst {{loosely based}} upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no {{emphasis}} on actually scoring runs. The bat can be anything, {{as long as it}} can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. However, usage of a bat is necessary. A ball is the other essential item. Tennis balls are often used {{due to the fact that}} they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball. They are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness. Tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls, especially at low speeds. [...] Often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing'. This is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with: gaffer tape, <b>electrical</b> <b>tape,</b> plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available. The pitch can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat. The wicket may be any convenient object – a chair, a cardboard box, a set of long twigs or sticks, a rubbish bin, tree or a drawing on the wall. [...] Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway. A wicket at the non-striker's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe. [...] Its main purpose is to mark the bowler's crease, but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out. Games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket, opting instead for a batsmen-vs-everyone format.|$|E

40|$|In {{the high}} {{luminosity}} {{era of the}} Large Hadron Collider, the HL-LHC, the instantaneous luminosity {{is expected to reach}} unprecedented values, resulting in about 200 proton-proton interactions in a typical bunch crossing. To cope with the resultant increase in occupancy, bandwidth and radiation damage, the ATLAS Inner Detector will be replaced by an all-silicon system, the Inner Tracker (ITk). The ITk consists of a silicon pixel and a strip detector and exploits the concept of modularity. Prototyping and testing of various strip detector components has been carried out. This paper presents the developments and results obtained with reduced-size structures equivalent to those foreseen {{to be used in the}} forward region of the silicon strip detector. Referred to as petalets, these structures are built around a composite sandwich with embedded cooling pipes and <b>electrical</b> <b>tapes</b> for routing the signals and power. Detector modules built using electronic flex boards and silicon strip sensors are glued on both the front and back side surfaces of the carbon structure. Details are given on the assembly, testing and evaluation of several petalets. Measurement results of both mechanical and electrical quantities are shown. Moreover, an outlook is given for improved prototyping plans for large structures. Comment: 22 pages for submission for Journal of Instrumentatio...|$|R
