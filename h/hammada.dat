50|$|Tabelia <b>hammadae,</b> {{which was}} also {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the oldest known simians along with Algeripithecus, was shown to be a synonym of Azibius when more complete fossils were discovered at Gour Lazib between 2003 and 2009. Likewise, the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis have been reinterpreted as being the upper fourth premoloar (P4) of Azibius and has been considered a synonym. However, in 2010, Godinot cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar. He also reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that they may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms. In 2011, Marivaux et al. published an interpretation of recently discovered talus bones found at Gour Lazib, which they claimed were more similar to those of living strepsirrhines and extinct adapiforms, not simians, thus reinforcing the strepsirrhine status favored by Tabuce et al. two years earlier. The tali morphology also differed radically from those of plesiadapiforms, confirming that azibiids are true primates.|$|R

In 1978, 4 Arabian oryxs were brought to the reserve for a breeding program. Starting in 1983, 31 oryxs were released into the wild, successfully returning the oryx into its native environment. Other species, such as Somali ostriches, Persian onagers and gazelles reside in the reserve. Before the establishment of the reserve, hunting nearly annihilated local animal populations, a problem which RSCN has been successful in dealing with.|$|E

Thirty samples of the browsing parts were collected from the rangelands of Yazd province in autumn. Chemical composition of samples including Dry Matter (DM), Crude Protein (CP), Crude Fiber (CF), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Ether Extract (EE), Total Ash (TA), macro elements (Ca, P, Mg, K), micro elements (Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn) and gross energy (GE) were analyzed. The in vitro digestibility was determined by camel rumen liquor in Tilley and Terry method. Palatability of the plants were measured by three mature camels in cafeteria trials. The camels voluntarily fed 11 plant species during one hour for six days. Data were analyzed by GLM method in SAS software. The highest CP (18. 3 %) and the lowest NDF (40. 4 %) and ADF (35. 4 %) were related to Tamarix aphylla.

Their total phenolic and flavanoid contents were assessed. The antioxidant activity was estimated using 2, 2 -di- phenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as free radical scavenger. Their crude extracts showed reducing potential proportional to their concentration. The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) between antioxidant activity and their total phenolics and flavanoids content is 0. 77 and 0. 98 respectively. Crude aqueous, methanolic as well as alkaloids extracts of the five plants were tested against a number of G+ve and G-ve sensitive resistant (e. g MRSA) bacteria beside some fungal species. The aqueous extracts displayed weak antibacterial activity whereas methanolic extracts were profoundly effective against both G+ve and G-ve bacteria. The extracts of E. serrata and H. scoparia were highly effective against E. coli in particular. The alkaloid-rich extracts of H. albus and H. scoparia induced remarkable bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{designed}} to examine the effect of desert shrubs on the dynamics of free-living amoebae in arid soil.

The vertical distributions of the four main morphological types of amoebae, grouped according to their mobility, and of small flagellate populations were measured under the canopies of <b>Hammada</b> scoparia and Atriplex halimus, shrubs belonging to the chloride-absorbing xerohalophytes. The result obtained from the field study demonstrated that the total number of protozoa was significantly higher during the wet seasons (winter and spring) than during the dry seasons. The protozoan population was more diverse under the canopy of H. scoparia during the wet seasons, reaching 8, 000 individuals per 1 g of dry soil, whereas during the dry seasons, the populations were higher under the canopy of A. halimus, with a mean of 250 individuals. The protozoan population in the deeper layers (40 to 50 cm) was found to be as active as that in the upper layers, demonstrating that, in the desert, soil columns below 20 cm are fertile and worth studying.

Only eight perennial species were found in the site of which H. elegans and R. stricta were almost exclusively co-dominating the area.

40|$|Background and objectives: A {{pharmaceutical}} products that is {{planned to be}} used in clinic, should not only have beneficial effects but also be safe too. Preclinical studies in animals are costly and need considering ethical issues. Cell culture can be used before animal tests. Considering useful effects of these methods, we have evaluated safety of total methanol extract of <b>Hammada</b> salicornica and its aqueous and petroleum ether fractions in cell culture. Methods: Total methanol extract was prepared with the standard method of maceration. Different fractions were prepared by liquid-liquid fractionation and the extracts were then dried with rotary evaporator. After determination of bactericidal concentration of the extracts, 400 ug/mL, the cytotoxicity was tested at various concentrations regarding the minimum antibacterial concentration by MTT test. Hep- 2 c and VERO cell lines were used in MTT test. A range of concentrations (10 - 500 ug/mL) of the extracts were prepared and were added to about 70 % confluent 96 well plates. After exposure for 48 h, MTT solution was added to the wells, and 4 h later formazan crystals were solubilized and optical densities were read at 570 nm. Results: Cytotoxicity Index was calculated and significance test was performed using t-test comparing the Index of the test and control group at each concentration.
