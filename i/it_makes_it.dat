It has found that seasonal agricultural loans and lease-to-own agreements for equipment and livestock help the poor establish better agriculture. The bank has set a new goal: to make each of its branch locations free of poverty, as defined by benchmarks such as having adequate food and access to clean water and latrines.|$|E
5|$|The Bc5 may {{not seem}} {{particularly}} useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> difficult for White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2 diagonal via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal {{to put pressure on}} f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to store large amounts of information outside {{of the human body}} and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E

25|$|The rules {{set by the}} Commission {{establish}} that biofuels should not be made from feedstocks from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas. The corresponding Communication explains how this should be assessed and as an example, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> clear that the conversion of a forest to a palm oil plantation would not meet the sustainability requirements.|$|E
25|$|The current {{regulation}} does not prohibit travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba per se, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> illegal for U.S. citizens to have transactions (spend money or receive gifts) in Cuba under most circumstances without a US government Office of Foreign Assets Control issued license. Since even paying unavoidable airfare ticket taxes into a Cuban airport would violate this transaction law, it is effectively impossible for ordinary tourists to visit Cuba {{without breaking the}} monetary transaction rule.|$|E

The world's first ever floodlit football match took place at Bramall Lane on 14 October 1878 in front of an attendance of 20,000. England's match against Scotland on 10 March 1883 was the first match between these two countries outside London or Glasgow. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the oldest football venue still capable of hosting international matches in the world.|$|E

25|$|Some {{action has}} been taken by the {{government}} in order to promote French culture and the French language. For instance, they have established a system of subsidies and preferential loans for supporting French cinema. The Toubon law, from the name of the conservative culture minister who promoted <b>it,</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> mandatory to use French in advertisements directed to the general public. Note that contrary to some misconceptions sometimes found in the Anglophone media, the French government neither regulates the language used by private parties in commercial settings, nor makes it compulsory that France-based WWW sites should be in French.|$|E
25|$|Pending a {{thorough}} {{review of the}} Recent and prehistoric cormorants, the single-genus approach is followed here for three reasons: first, it is preferable to tentatively assigning genera without a robust hypothesis. Second, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> {{easier to deal with}} the fossil forms, the systematic treatment of which has been no less controversial than that of living cormorants and shags. Third, this scheme is also used by the IUCN, making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation. In accordance with the treatment there, the imperial shag complex is here left unsplit as well, but the king shag complex has been.|$|E
25|$|The deed of 1278 {{mentioned}} above {{provides the best}} documentary evidence for the location of Montfichet's Tower. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> clear that the tower was between Ludgate and the river, inside {{the line of the}} city walls. Baynard's Castle lay to the south, adjacent to St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. A 1980s study of the topography of medieval London suggested a location bounded by Ludgate Hill and Carter Lane to the north and south, and St Paul's deanery and the city wall to the east and west respectively. Redevelopment gave the Department of Urban Archaeology of the Museum of London the opportunity to excavate the area, between 1986 and 1990.|$|E

25|$|Thomas was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Arizona's 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act, a law intended to regulate the presence of illegal immigrants in the state. Sometimes called the “Employer Sanctions Law,” <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a felony for a person to take the identity of another person, whether real or fictitious, for the purposes of obtaining employment, and provides civil penalties for employers that intentionally or knowingly employ an alien who does not have the legal right or authorization under federal law to work in the United States. After the act was signed into law, Thomas set up a web site that explained the law, and provided a form to report violations.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay {{is among}} the most {{impressive}} of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> very easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result, special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.|$|E
25|$|Some audiophiles use horn {{loudspeakers}} for audio reproduction, {{while others}} eschew horn systems for their harmonic resonances, finding in them an unpleasant form of distortion. Since {{there are a}} variety of horn designs (of differing length, material, and taper, as well as different drivers) it is, to some extent, impossible to give such blanket characterizations to horn loudspeakers. Audiophiles using low power amplifiers, sometimes in the five to twenty-five watt range, may find the typically high efficiency of horn loudspeakers an especially attractive feature because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to reach playable music levels. Conversely, greater care must be taken in selection of ones audio gear, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse at the distances of a typical living room.|$|E
