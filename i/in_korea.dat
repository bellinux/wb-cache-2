5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities <b>in</b> <b>Korea,</b> all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain <b>in</b> <b>Korea</b> prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive <b>in</b> <b>Korea,</b> being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E
5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit <b>in</b> <b>Korea.</b> I Corps remained <b>in</b> <b>Korea</b> as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E

5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military <b>in</b> <b>Korea,</b> and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war.

Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces <b>in</b> <b>Korea.</b> With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E

In July the Kansas and Wyoming Lines were strengthened, while a limited offensive in the east-central sector in mid-August seized the high ground around the Punchbowl and Bloody Ridge during the Battle of Bloody Ridge. In September the offensive in this sector continued, targeting the next hill complex north of Bloody Ridge, known as Heartbreak Ridge.|$|E

Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however {{the effectiveness of these}} final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for the final weeks of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations <b>in</b> <b>Korea.</b> During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions at the negotiating table.

5|$|Following the {{armistice}} both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created.

Total Army casualties <b>in</b> <b>Korea</b> included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment.
