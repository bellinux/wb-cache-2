5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{encounter}} with Turbine, Radetzky managed to <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> railroad bridge {{near the town of}} Fermo, severely hampering the movement of troops and supplies in the region. Sixty-three Italian civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment.

In a level exclusive to the Game of the Year Edition, Cate is sent on vacation to a small island, only to discover and <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> secret H.A.R.M. base.|$|E
50|$|Via {{a series}} of T-dualities one obtains the result that in any type II {{superstring}} theory, when an NS5-brane and a Dp-brane cross one necessarily creates or <b>destroys</b> <b>a</b> D(p-2)-brane. Lifting this statement to M-theory one finds that when two M5-branes cross, one creates or <b>destroys</b> <b>an</b> M2-brane. Using S-duality one may obtain transitions without NS5-brane. For example, when a D5-brane and a D3-cross one creates or <b>destroys</b> <b>a</b> fundamental string.|$|R

5|$|The finale {{focuses on}} series protagonist Aang's non-violent {{personality}} and his reluctance to kill Fire Lord Ozai (Mark Hamill).

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|Alien Rage is a first-person shooter {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network).

In its single player campaign, players are put in control of an elite soldier named Jack. Jack is sent to <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> mining facility and the aliens within it after the aliens turned against and killed the humans that they had shared the facility with.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed to <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> single completed U-boat on the slip until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be checked by attacking production. An indication of the effectiveness of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E
5|$|Ending S: Unbreakable Bond: Events proceed roughly as in Ending A, {{except that}} Elena is purged of the curse. Aeron must then <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> monstrous Zeron, saving Elena one last time. The two then leave while Mavda uses the chain {{to destroy the}} Thirteen Towers, sacrificing herself to end their evils. In the epilogue, it is {{revealed}} that the kingdoms manage to end the War of Independence after {{the closing of the}} Scar, the Vestra are granted new lands to settle on by Elyria after Elyria's king receives a letter from Mavda detailing events at the Towers, and Aeron and Elena lived happily together.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
