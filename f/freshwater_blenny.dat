50|$|The <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny,</b> (Salaria fluviatilis), is {{a species}} of fish in the family Blenniidae. It is found in African rivers and brooks in Algeria and Morocco flowing to the Mediterranean Sea. In Europe it is {{widespread}} in the freshwaters of Albania, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Spain and Portugal, while in Asia it is in Turkey and Israel. This species reaches a length of 15 cm TL.|$|E
50|$|The jugular blenny (Alloblennius jugularis) is a combtooth blenny (family Blenniidae) {{found in}} the western Indian Ocean. Klunzinger {{originally}} placed this species in the genus Blennius. It is a tropical, marine and <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> which is known from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea, in the western Indian Ocean. Male jugular blennies can reach a maximum standard length of 5 centimetres (1.97 inches). The blennies are oviparous.|$|E
40|$|Non-indigenous {{species can}} have strong impacts on {{biodiversity}} by affecting trophic relationships {{in their new}} environments. The piscivorous dice snake (Natrix tessellata) has been introduced to Geneva Lake, western Switzerland, where the endangered viperine snake (Natrix maura) is native. Local, dramatic declines in the viperine snake population might {{be associated with the}} appearance of the dice snake through dietary overlap between these 2 species, which mainly feed on bullhead (Cottus gobio). In response to this decline, a control program for dice snake was implemented in 2007 to reduce numbers of this introduced snake. In 2010, a new species of fish, the <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> (Salaria fluviatilis), which shares the same habitat as the bullhead, was introduced into Lake Geneva and has since reached high densities. We determined the impact of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> on diet composition and body condition of dice snakes. In addition, we tested for effects of the control program on the body condition of dice snakes and viperine snakes. We collected 294 dice snakes between 2007 and 2013. Based on morphology and a genetic marker (cytochrome b gene), we determined the Â®sh species contained in these snakes' stomachs. We found a drastic switch in dice snake diet following the arrival of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny,</b> as consumption of bullhead declined by 68 % and was replaced by the blenny. In addition, the body condition of dice snakes increased significantly after the arrival of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny.</b> The body condition of both snake species was positively correlated with the number of dice snakes removed from the study area. This finding has important implications concerning the conservation of the endangered viperine snake, and suggests that the control program of dice snakes should be continued...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} tactics (ARTs) {{driven by}} environmental factors are common among fish. However, {{the flexibility of}} fish to adopt distinct tactics {{in response to the}} characteristics of their environment has received little attention. The aim of the present work was to study phenotypic plasticity in the adoption of dominant behaviour ("bourgeois tactic") by male <b>freshwater</b> <b>blennies</b> (Salaria fluviatilis (Asso, 1801)). For this purpose, two simultaneous experiments in aquaria were performed to examine the effect of social cues and nest abundance on the acquisition of secondary sexual characteristics (SSCs). Experiments were conducted with small (individuals without SSCs), medium-sized (1 -year-old individuals), and large older dominant males (more than 2 years old), all collected in the wild. In experiment 1, the three sizes of males were combined to compare the development of SSCs depending on intrasexual context. In experiment 2, the effect of nest abundance (two nests vs. six nests) was tested for each size of male. Medium-sized males showed phenotypic plasticity in response to the environmental conditions simulated in the two experiments. The absence of larger dominant males was found to be the main factor enhancing SSCs and the onset of parental behaviour. Nest shortage also influenced the degree of cephalic crest development among medium-sized males. This knowledge helps to understand how the population of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blennies</b> still persists when it is reduced to young individuals during the summer droughts in Mediterranean streams...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the marine}} blenny Salaria pavo and the freshwater S. fluviatilis and S. economidisi were analyzed using four molecular markers: the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, and the control region and the nuclear first intron of the S 7 ribosomal protein. The monophyly of Salaria is supported, {{as well as that}} of S. pavo and that of all the freshwater members of Salaria. Thus, the present results support a single origin for all freshwater Mediterranean blenniids. Our results reject the placement of the species of Salaria in the genus Lipophrys as proposed in previous studies. Using a molecular clock calibrated with trans-Isthmian geminate blenniid species, the split between the ancestor of the freshwater lineage and the ancestor of S. pavo is tentatively placed in the Middle Miocene (well before the Messinian). The marine S. pavo displays a very low level of intraspecific sequence divergence consistent with a Pleistocene bottleneck. S. fluviatilis is a paraphyletic entity with S. economidisi nested within it. A Moroccan population of S. fluviatilis is more divergent than S. economidisi, both in nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Fish from Israel together with some Turkish samples represent the second oldest split. It is argued that these populations may represent cryptic species. Thus, further studies on the taxonomy of these <b>freshwater</b> <b>blennies</b> are urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of hydrological stress (streamflow reduction) on the reproductive and nesting behaviour of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> (Salaria fluviatilis) males in a Mediterranean-type stream in NE Spain (a tributary of the Ebro River). The investigation included two study periods: (i) before stream flow reduction (sampling in 2004) and (ii) afterwards (study year 2011). Nesting males in 2004 (N = 31) and 2011 (N = 11) were measured, weighed and photographed in the field. The size of the total egg cluster (male reproductive success) was measured and photographed for each nest found (N = 137 in 2004 and N = 28 in 2011). Nesting area was measured to determine nest density for each sampling period. The degree of secondary sexual traits (SSTs) development was measured later through the photographs. The age of males was assigned according to the length-intervals established by Vinyoles and De Sostoa (2007) for this species in the same study area. After flow reduction in 2011, the flooded area of the river bed was reduced by more than 80 %. A great proportion of small males (1 year old) with developed SSTs (cephalic crest and anal glands) were found to defend a nest. This {{is the first time}} that parental care is found for the male of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> at a young age. Total cluster size (mean SE) is halved under the low flow conditions (from 45. 4 2. 8 cm 2 to 22. 9 2. 7 cm 2), but an increase in the number of partial clusters per nest was found. This study highlights the sexual plasticity of <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> males depending on environmental conditions and the vulnerability of this endangered species to the hydrological changes of anthropogenic origin in Spain...|$|E
40|$|The use and {{learning}} of visual landmarks {{seem to be}} strongly influenced by ecological demands and vary according to habitat, sex and, presumably, dominance status. In blennies, sexes differ in their home-range extension and this could predispose them to use different mechanisms to navigate. The main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if Salaria fluviatilis (a benthonic and polyginic <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny)</b> was able to solve a learning maze using direct visual landmarks. Performance between sexes was compared, and the possible relationship between the males' secondary sexual characteristics (SSCs) development and their spatial ability was considered. In this species, the SSCs consist of a cephalic crest and a pair of anal glands. Fish were subjected to 10 sessions (each one consisting of 11 consecutive trials) in a specially designed apparatus where they had to find the correct exit using direct visual landmarks. The proportion of males that learned the task (80 %) was higher than that of females (30 %). Cephalic crest development of the male was associated with a higher readiness to solve the spatial task. These results support the importance of ecological demands in shaping a species' spatial abilities. They also provide a comprehensive perspective that would link dominance (through cephalic crest development), learning and sexual selection...|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{freshwater}}</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria fluviatilis, and {{the marine}} peacock blenny, S. pavo, {{are closely related}} and can survive in both freshwater and seawater. Salaria fluviatilis is widespread in rivers and lakes {{in the vicinity of}} the Mediterranean basin, including Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), and S. pavo is distributed in rocky parts of the Mediterranean coast. This study investigated the effect of salinity acclimation on routine activity level. Fish were accli-mated for three months in 0 %, 40 %, and 100 % seawater mixed with 100 %, 60 %, and 0 % dechlorinated tap water (< 2, 14. 4, and 36 ppt sea salt, respec-tively). The fish were then placed in aquaria equipped with IR beam projec-tors and detectors set up to count their activity level in the different salinities under a photoperiod of 14 : 10 L:D. S. pavo demonstrated a simple daily rhythm of activity, being active during the light phase, whereas S. fluviatilis was also active in the light phase, but demonstrated a bimodal activity pattern. In both species, activity decreased during the acclimation period. The bimodal daily activity pattern of S. fluviatilis might be a result of the daily wind regime on Lake Kinneret in summer (MayâOctober). The activity reduction in lower or higher salinities (in relation to natural habitat) is suggested to be a tertiary stress response...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean {{freshwater}} ichthyofauna {{includes many}} interesting but poorly known species, because of little interest for sport fishing and culinary purposes. Salaria fluviatilis {{is the most}} widespread <b>freshwater</b> <b>blenny</b> of the Mediterranean. This species is found in rivers, brooks and low altitude lakes rich in branches and with stone bottom. Average lifespan is up to 5 years; larvae are planktonic until the size of about 1. 5 cm and live in quiet waters. They reach a size of 12 cm on average and males are larger than females, and have a small ridge on the head. S. fluviatilis feeds on benthic organisms like small snails and shrimps, on fish {{and all kinds of}} insect larvae; it is itself prey of birds (migratory and resident), tortoise (e. g. Emys orbicularis) and snakes (e. g. Natrix spp). The population is very fragmented, and few data are available due to the difficulties to catch or to observe this fish; consequently, {{it is difficult to know}} its conservation status. It is included in Annex III of the Bern Convention and is considered a locally endangered species, listed by the IUCN Red List. The species is included in the overall plan of action for the conservation of freshwater Italian fishes. In South Italy, the main threat factors are water pollution, habitat destruction (gravel extraction, damming, canalization of rivers, etc.) and introduction of non-native predatory fish species like catfish (Ameiurus melas), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), of two allochthonous decapod crustaceans (Procambarus clarkii and Orconectes limosus) and two Testudines (Trachemys spp.). Due to their important ecological and trophic role of connection between benthic invertebrates, migratory birds and reptiles, we started a monitoring scientific program, capture of breeding animals, setting up of dedicated mesocosms and reproduction as well as rearing of juveniles for, local or in larger scale, restocking purpose allowed by the low genetic divergence of the species...|$|E
