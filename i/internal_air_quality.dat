50|$|Control of {{building}} design {{was transferred to}} the Department of Public Works in 1893 and the department's architects trialled a number of technical innovations. Queensland's education architecture became markedly more advanced and the range of standard building types increased. The most noticeable change in Queensland school architecture was the introduction of high-set buildings. This provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play space underneath. Also, windows were rearranged and enlarged and sills were lowered to approximately 1m above floor level. By 1909 windows were altered so that the maximum amount of light came from one direction and desks were rearranged so that this light fell onto the left hand side of students. Since students were forcedly right-handed, no shadow would be cast onto the page. The wall supporting the blackboard had no windows. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing older buildings. Dormers were sometimes added to the roof to provide better light and ventilation and the larger classrooms favoured in earlier designs were partitioned to create smaller ones with better lighting. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous ventilation flap on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, combined with a ceiling vent and large roof fleche, improved <b>internal</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> and decreased internal temperatures effectively. This type was introduced around 1909 and was constructed until approximately 1920. Significantly, Dr Eleanor Bourne was appointed the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911 and under her instruction the relationship between classroom environment and child health was given prominence. Accordingly, school architecture evolved through iteration and experimentation to improve interior light and ventilation.Such design innovations were included in a new building for the Boys' School at Bowen, constructed in 1917 {{to the west of the}} 1884 boys' building. Called the Big Room, it was a high-set timber building with a gable roof and a northerly and southerly verandah. It had a large number of windows in the gable end walls with sill heights approximately 1m from floor level. It incorporated a hinged board, ceiling vent, and large roof fleche for ventilation. The roof fleche was removed at some time prior to 2006. This building survives and in 2012 is named Block C.In 1919 an Honour Board memorialising 70 past students who served in World War I was installed in the Big Room and unveiled by the mayor in the presence of a crowded audience. The board took the form of a Grecian temple facade decorated to represent marble. It was claimed to be the largest in a North Queensland school, measuring 5 ft 6in wide by 6 ft high (1.67m x 1.82m). This board was moved to the Bowen Historical Museum some time after its installation although no evidence has been discovered as to when or why it was moved.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{evaluation}} of indoor air quality in a classroom equipped with cross-flow ventilation is presented. A numerical methodology, based on comparison with experimental data, used in {{the evaluation of}} the air exchange rate, airflow rate and the age of the air, was applied in the first phase of this work. The evolution of carbon dioxide inside spaces, with different airflow typologies, was then predicted in the second part. The study was based on a school located in the South of Portugal. In the experimental methodology the tracer gas decay method was applied. In order to reduce the experimental time, the first minutes of the test were measured, while the remaining decay was obtained using a numerical exponential regression. Natural and forced cross-flow ventilation topologies were analyzed. In the case of forced ventilation, fresh air from the external environment was driven into the classroom through an air inlet using a supply fan. An extract strategy was also used in which stale air was mechanically extracted from the classroom. Natural ventilation consisted of opening perimeter and above-door windows. The forecast of carbon dioxide evolution was made using software that evaluates the thermal response of and air quality in a building with complex topology. The numerical model used to evaluate <b>internal</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> was based on energy and mass conservation integral equations.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{concepts}} of efficient energy use focus has shifted towards buildings becoming more air tight and having lower levels of ventilation. This {{is due to the fact}} that as buildings become better insulated and conduction heat loss is reduced the proportion of heating and air conditioning load due to ventilation has increased and may offer the largest scope for reducing energy demand. This may have a detrimental effect on <b>internal</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> (IAQ) and compounds existing environmental issues such as out gassing from materials in new buildings. At the same time environmental standards and expectations have risen as has the technical capability to evaluate their effects through epidemiological studies. Good environmental quality is a fundamental human need, absence of which affects health and productivity. Many occupants express annoyance about modern buildings and terms such as sick building syndrome (SBS) are used to describe the problem. Deterioration of IAQ has been evident from an increase in occupant complaints and an increase in breathing related sicknesses in recent years. With predicted substantial growth of the urban environment the problem will only be exacerbated in the future. A simple and effective solution to the problem of deficient IAQ is increasing ventilation but increasing the amount of inlet fresh air has direct bearing on energy load. Another important factor is the ventilation scheme (mechanical, natural, mixedmode). This paper looks at the relationship between good IAQ, ventilation, associated energy overheads and carbon emissions. Also identified are best practices that optimise the performance of a building in relation to this issue...|$|E

The UK House building industry is driven by policy and regulation to achieve sustainable and low energy new houses. The current focus on air tight construction however means {{it is important to}} balance ventilation of dwellings with the activities undertaken within them; this involves analysis of the behaviour of the occupants who are passive adopters of the new technologies.

40|$|The {{subway system}} is an {{important}} traffic facility in Beijing and its <b>internal</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> is an environmental issue that could potentially affect millions of people every day. Due to the intrinsic nature of rail abrasion in subway tunnels, iron-containing particles can be generated and become suspended in the subway environment. While some studies (e. g. Li et al., 2006) have monitored the in-train levels of PM 2. 5 (particles < 2. 5 ?m), {{there is a lack}} of systematic assessment of the concentration and characteristics of iron-containing particles in the Beijing subway system. Here we report results of a study on the granulometric and magnetic properties of deposited particle samples collected at different localities of the Beijing subway system. Our results show that the subway samples are characterized by the presence of fine particles. Volume proportions of 6. 1 ± 1. 3 % for particles < 2. 5 ?m and 27. 5 ± 6. 1 % for particles < 10 ?m are found in the bulk subway samples. These samples exhibit a strong magnetic signal, which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that in naturally deposited particles collected in Beijing. Fine grained ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic minerals (e. g. iron and magnetite, respectively) are identified from mineral magnetic measurements and scanning electric microscopy. The samples collected from the Beijing stations with platform screen doors are found to be magnetically stronger and finer than those without them, suggesting that platform screen doors have failed to block the fine iron-containing particles released from the rail tunnel. Given the potential health consequences of fine suspended iron-containing particles, our results have important implications for air quality management in the Beijing subway system...|$|E
40|$|Creating {{the built}} {{environment}} seems to require {{the destruction of the}} natural environment. The impact of a building on the environment goes far beyond the space that was cleared to make way for it. Humans require resources (energy, water, materials) to continue to live, work and play in the buildings that we have created. Reducing the impact of ever-enlarging human settlements is necessary to protect the environment in which we rely so much. The Subiaco Sustainable Demonstration Home (SSDH) is a collaborative effort between a local council and the building industry to create a house that uses fewer resources than normally built homes during its construction, use, and eventual demolition. The house has sustainability design features for water efficiency and water recycling, energy generation and efficient energy use, Universal design for the disabled, Low-allergen design to improve <b>internal</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality,</b> and sustainably sourced materials to minimise the cost to the environment due to its construction. The house has also been designed using Passive Solar (PS) design, so should remain thermally comfortable inside for most of the year, without the need of active heating or cooling systems. The house follows PS principles with: house and block having a north orientation, extensive glazing (protected in summer) on the north to maximise solar exposure in winter; internal thermal mass to minimise temperature swings; insulation to control heat energy flows; good ventilation to remove heat; and zoning to maximise human comfort. The house {{was the subject of a}} thermal monitoring programme throughout 2004, which will continue to January 2006. The objective of the monitoring was to record the internal thermal conditions (temperature and humidity) to determine how effective the house is in remaining within established thermal comfort levels without the need of mechanically-based heating or cooling systems. The house has demonstrated that it can remain within human thermal comfort levels for the majority of time, but needs to be operated properly by the occupants. In order for the house to be thermally comfortable, windows and curtains need to be opened at the right time to control the flow of energy into or out of the building. The result is a healthier, more comfortable living environment that is financially and environmentally cheaper to maintain than the currently constructed housing being created elsewhere around Australia...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining IAQ (<b>Internal</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Quality)</b> {{and thermal}} comfort of {{occupants}} in buildings {{have been a}} challenge to overcome satisfying the two ends: criteria for sustainability and cost effectiveness. Although there was a movement for mechanical ventilation systems in the recent past, {{in addition to the}} cost involved, they are found to not deliver the desired air quality, lead to social consequences such as sick building syndrome, contribute to environmental consequences related to ozone-depleting substances with increasing energy consumption, generate noise and having difficulties in cleaning and maintaining. These consequences compelled research on natural ventilation systems, which were used in ancient buildings. Although it has been found that natural ventilation of buildings can become a substantial architectural design tool that leads to “breathing architecture,” fluctuations in indoor temperature and air quality makes depending entirely on natural ventilation less effective. The combination of natural and mechanical ventilation, the hybrid ventilation or mixed-mode ventilation, systems utilizes advantages and eliminates drawbacks from both mechanical and entirely dependent natural ventilation systems. Hybrid ventilation systems, which have been utilized in historical buildings, with less investment cost and reduction of energy usage {{have been found to be}} a solution to provide acceptable standards of IAQ and thermal comfort through natural air circulation in buildings. This research study was carried out to verify the effectiveness of a hybrid ventilation system in an auditorium built around 60 years back for its effectiveness as a provider of thermal comfort to its occupants. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling was carried out on a Finite Element (FE) model owing to its capability of offering a wide range of flexible analytical solutions, lower realization time and comparative cost effectiveness to experimental methods of modeling. This verification of the system has revealed that hybrid ventilation systems could provide effective thermal comfort in buildings designed specifically to allow circulation of air through the system. The results of the study were in agreement with measured data and the expected flow of air through the building when the thermal load due to metabolism of occupants was not included in the analysis. In addition, the expected results complied with similar studies on natural/hybrid ventilation systems. With the addition of the thermal load, as a uniform heat flux from the flow of the auditorium, it was observed that the conditioning of the air throughout the space was better than the without thermal load scenario. In the case modeling people as cylinders, with a convective heat flux, it was observed that the air flow direction changes and the seating level of the auditorium do not get sufficient air flow to maintain a comfortable air quality.   Ineffective simulation of the inlet louver was assumed to be the primary reason for this scenario and other reasons such as the seating arrangement modeling too could have effects on the result. As conclusions of the study it was found that the whole building system properties have to be selected, as the control component to produce operating commands, to circulate air through the building in accordance with the air flow: both velocity and patterns, required to maintain thermal comfort of all occupants. Air inflow could be through windows as acquisition components to collect indoor and outdoor climatic parameters and air outflow could be mechanically controlled through exhausted fans turning on or off as the operating component in the system. The result of the study ensures the method of solutions through CFD to be utilized to provide effective and less costly path to verify systems such as natural or hybrid air flow systems through buildings.   The whole system studied could be applied with suitable contextual modifications to any new location, with similar cost effective modeling, to produce less fuel consuming building systems leading to sustainability of built environment. ...|$|E
