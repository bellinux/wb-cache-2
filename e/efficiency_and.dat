5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, <b>efficiency,</b> <b>and</b> durability.|$|E

5|$|After 1966, in {{a radical}} {{departure}} from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, <b>efficiency,</b> <b>and</b> foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
5|$|Between 1999 and 2000, {{the power}} station {{was given a}} turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's {{condensers}} were also refurbished.
