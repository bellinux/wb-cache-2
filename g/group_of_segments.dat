40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that listeners separate an acoustic mixture by auditory scene analysis (ASA) in which a perceptual description of each sound source is formed – a stream (Bregman, 1990). Typically, ASA {{is seen as a}} precursor to attentional mechanisms which simply select one stream as the attentional focus. However, recent work by Carlyon et al. (2001) has suggested that attention {{plays a key role in}} the formation of streams. The work presented here incorporates this finding into a new model of ASA in which attentional factors play a role in both the grouping and stream selection stages. Initial stages of the model consist of auditory peripheral processing followed by pitch and harmonicity analysis. The core of the model comprises a network of neural oscillators which perform stream segregation on the basis of oscillatory correlation (Wang, 1996). Individual segments (contiguous regions of acoustic energy) are created by forming local excitatory connections between oscillators. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> which are deemed to be consistent with the F 0 estimate have a further set of excitatory connections placed between them to achieve grouping by harmonicity. Each oscillator is connected to an attentional leaky integrator (ALI) by excitatory links, the strengths of which are modulated by an attention interest vector.

40|$|Abstract. Recognizing {{objects from}} images becomes a {{more and more}} {{important}} research and application topic. There are diverse applications such as face recognition, analysis of aerial images from multicopters, object tracking, image-based web search, etc. Many existing approaches focus on shape retrieval from a single polygon of contour points, or they try to compare clouds of interesting points of an object. However, human object recognition concentrates on few points of the segments forming the object. Clearly, complex objects, strictly speaking the projections of their shape on the image plain, consist of several (polygonal) segments. Therefore, the procedure {{presented in this paper}} takes this into account, by composing objects hierarchically into a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments.</b> We briefly introduce our procedure for semantic object recognition based on clusters of image segment contours and discuss the problem of recognizing objects from different perspectives. ...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Characterization of {{a protein}} family by its dis-tinct {{sequence}} domains {{is crucial for}} functional annota-tion and correct classification of newly discovered proteins. Conventional Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) based methods find difficulties when faced with heterogeneous groups of proteins. However, even many families of pro-teins that do share a common domain contain instances of several other domains, without any common underlying linear ordering. Ignoring this modularity may lead to poor or even false classification results. An automated method that can analyze a group of proteins into the sequence do-mains it contains is therefore highly desirable. Results: We apply a novel method {{to the problem of}} protein domain detection. The method takes as input an unaligned group of protein sequences. It segments them and clusters the segments into groups sharing the same underlying statistics. A Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model is built using a Prediction Suffix Tree (PST) data structure for each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments.</b> Refinement is achieved by letting the PSTs compete over the segments, and a deterministic annealing framework infers the number of underlying PST models while avoiding many inferior solutions. We show that regions of similar statistics correlate well with protein sequence domains, by matching a unique signature to each domain. This is done in a fully automated manner, and does not require or attempt an MSA. Several representative cases are analyzed. We identify a protein fusion event, refine an HMM superfamily classification into the underlying families the HMM cannot separate, and detect all 12 instances of a short domain in a group of 396 sequences.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} a {{speculative}} {{introduction to the}} creation of a new nomenclatural hierarchy for the spinal cord-an ontology. The traditional regional subdivision of the spinal cord is based on the levels of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebrae. The boundaries of these vertebral regions correlate roughly with the functional regions of the cord, but the discrepancies are significant. The new regional classification proposed in the chapter is based on the distinct areas of gene expression and AChE/ChAT staining that define the limb enlargements and the sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic groups as an alternative to the "vertebral" classification. This new scheme clearly clashes with the traditional cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccygeal designations, but is true to the developmental processes. Unlike the traditional classification, it can be applied to a range of species that have different numbers of cervical, thoracic or lumbar vertebrae, and takes into account intraspecific variation, such as "prefixing" and "postfixing" of limb enlargements. The system is founded on the assumption that the basic plan in mammals and birds is to have a group of five major spinal cord segments supplying the forelimb, followed by a long <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> with sympathetic preganglionic neurons, which is in turn followed by a group of five major spinal cord segments supplying the hindlimb.

To deliver reliable services, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on the label switched paths. We discuss a new scheme for providing path protection using a segment-based approach. Existing schemes like Local Path Protection protect each node/link by providing a backup path for each. In the new approach we look at the entire path as a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> (each consisting of successive links) and provide protection for each segment separately. This scheme offers flexibility in providing path protection to the network operator in comparison to the existing schemes. It provides a protection configuration meeting given QoS constraints and provides conservation of resources at the same time by using lesser number of backup paths. We discuss various mechanisms for providing Path Protection like detection and notification in the context of Segment Based Approach. Then we present algorithms along with analysis for segmenting a primary path which assure satisfaction of various QOS constraints in case of failure like switch over time, end-to-end delay, jitter and reliability with the aim of using no more resources than necessary. A visualization system for the above algorithms has also been developed which aids in understanding the above algorithms.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{contractile}} reserve may be blunted if perfusion and coronary flow reserve are reduced. Thus, {{it is conceivable that}} the predictive accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography may differ according to perfusion tracer uptake. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the relationship between the level of thallium- 201 uptake and the accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography in identifying reversible dysfunction. Sixty-nine patients (age 59 +/- 8 years, ejection fraction 40 %+/- 11 %) with chronic coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary revascularisation were studied. All patients underwent rest 201 Tl single-photon emission tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during low-dose dobutamine infusion on the same day before revascularisation and repeated echocardiography at least 30 days thereafter. At follow-up, recovery of function was observed in 49 % of 339 dysfunctional segments. The percentage of segments with post-revascularisation recovery of function and the percentage with contractile reserve increased in parallel with 201 Tl uptake both in the total <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> (chi 2 = 35. 5, P 80 %. The positive predictive value increased significantly with the level of 201 Tl uptake, and was suboptimal (46 %) in akinetic segments with severely reduced 201 Tl uptake. The negative predictive value decreased significantly with 201 Tl uptake, and it was less than suboptimal (29 %) in akinetic segments with normal tracer uptake. Sensitivity was lower in the subset of akinetic segments (42 %- 63 %) than in all dyssynergic segments (63 %- 76 %), whereas specificity was very high in akinetic segments (80 %- 84 %).

40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system must}} separate an acoustic mixture {{in order to}} create a perceptual description of each sound source. It has been proposed that this is achieved by a process of auditory scene analysis (ASA) in which a number of streams are produced, each describing a single sound source. Few computer models of ASA attempt to incorporate attentional effects, since ASA is typically seen as a precursor to attentional mechanisms. This assumption may be flawed: recent work has suggested that attention plays a key role in the formation of streams, as opposed to the conventional view that attention merely selects a pre-constructed stream. This study presents a conceptual framework for auditory selective attention in which the formation of groups and streams is heavily influenced by conscious and subconscious attention. This framework is implemented as a computational model comprising a network of neural oscillators which perform stream segregation on the basis of oscillatory correlation. Within the network, attentional interest is modelled as a gaussian distribution in frequency. This determines the connection weights between oscillators and the attentional process- the attentional leaky integrator (ALI). A segment or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> are said to be attended to if their oscillatory activity coincides temporally with a peak in the ALI activity. The output of the model is an ‘attentional stream’: a description of which frequencies are being attended at each epoch. The model successfully simulates a range of psychophysical phenomena. Furthermore, a number of predictions are made and a psychophysical experiment is conducted to investigate the time course of attentional allocation in a binaural streaming task. The results support the model prediction that attention is subject to a form of ‘reset ’ when the attentional focus is moved in space.
