25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a <b>dead</b> <b>band</b> wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} different types of carriers in multi-sampled pulse width modulators (MSPWMs). In the multiple sampling approach the modulating signal is sampled N times per switching period, so that the PWM waveform is updated at a rate which is a multiple of the switching frequency. It can be shown that the increased sampling frequency leads to a significant reduction of the smallsignal delay with respect to the single-sampled PWMs, allowing for higher bandwidths to be achieved in closed-loop operation. Beside these desirable effects, sampling the modulating signal causes <b>dead</b> <b>bands</b> to appear in the modulator transcharacteristic. Depending on the specific carrier waveform, these sampling-induced <b>dead</b> <b>bands</b> differently affect the PWM operation. In particular, the symmetric-on time modulation is found to be superior among other modulation schemes in terms of achievable closed-loop performances. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate our analyses...|$|R

In the upper left is a Gilbert cell, which works well for sine waves and square waves, but less well for pulses. In the case of square waves it acts as an XOR gate, which can also be made from NAND gates. On the middle left are two phase detectors: adding {{feedback}} and removing one NAND gate produces a time frequency detector. The delay line avoids a <b>dead</b> <b>band.</b> On the right is a charge pump with a filter at its output.|$|E
5000|$|A {{proportional}} {{phase detector}} employs a charge pump that supplies charge amounts {{in proportion to}} the phase error detected. Some have dead bands and some do not. Specifically, some designs produce both [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] control pulses even when the phase difference is zero. These pulses are small, nominally the same duration, and cause the charge pump to produce equal-charge positive and negative current pulses when the phase is perfectly matched. Phase detectors with this kind of control system don't exhibit a <b>dead</b> <b>band</b> and typically have lower minimum peak-to-peak jitter when used in PLLs.|$|E

Phil Lesh & Friends helped keep a legitimate entity for the band's music to continue. Recently, Lesh has opened a music venue called Terrapin Crossroads.
