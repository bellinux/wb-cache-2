5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the <b>grammatical</b> relations {{as in most}} European languages where <b>grammatical</b> subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the <b>grammatical</b> roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their <b>grammatical</b> or semantic role in the sentence. The <b>grammatical</b> cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either <b>grammatical</b> or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa <b>grammatical</b> gender classifies nouns {{as either}} animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the <b>grammatical</b> object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} <b>grammatical</b> subject, {{creating}} a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} of the morphological innovations that characterize Ottawa is {{the restructuring of}} the three person prefixes that occur on both nouns and verbs. The prefixes carry <b>grammatical</b> information about <b>grammatical</b> person (first, second, or third). Syncope modifies the pronunciation of the prefixes by deleting the short vowel in each prefix.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>grammatical</b> core cases ergative and absolutive {{are used}} to express <b>grammatical</b> and syntactical roles of {{participant}} noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so <b>grammatical</b> roles are indicated by a system of about eight <b>grammatical</b> cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|Person {{and number}} are {{indicated}} by suffixing the oblique {{case of the}} relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from <b>grammatical</b> particles, which {{are added to the}} stem.|$|E
5|$|The Greenlandic {{language}} uses case {{to express}} <b>grammatical</b> relations between {{participants in a}} sentence. Nouns are inflected {{with one of the}} two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.|$|E
5|$|Verbal endings convey {{information}} about <b>grammatical</b> person, number and voice. The imperative mood {{has its own}} set of endings.|$|E
5|$|Abbreviations {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} codex. The {{handwriting}} {{is very close to}} that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses <b>grammatical</b> forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with <b>grammatical</b> input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of <b>grammatical</b> function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|English writing also {{includes}} a system of punctuation {{that is similar to}} the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful <b>grammatical</b> relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the <b>grammatical</b> relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of <b>grammatical</b> person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|In formal written language, {{it used to}} be {{considered}} correct to place the genitive -s after the head of the noun phrase (hästen), though this is today considered dated, and different <b>grammatical</b> constructions are often used.|$|E
5|$|In its pronouns, E distinguishes for person between first, second, and third; {{in number}} between {{singular}} and plural; and, {{in the case}} of the first-person plural, between inclusive and exclusive we. E does not, however, make distinctions for <b>grammatical</b> gender.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} century of the Empire, refugee Byzantine {{scholars}} were principally responsible for carrying, {{in person and}} in writing, ancient Greek <b>grammatical,</b> literary studies, mathematical, and astronomical knowledge to early Renaissance Italy. During this period, astronomy and other mathematical sciences were taught in Trebizond; medicine attracted the interest of almost all scholars.|$|E
5|$|Israel was an {{accomplished}} poet, a disciple of the ninth-century Irish philosopher John Scottus Eriugena {{and one of}} the few Western scholars of his time to understand Greek. He wrote theological and <b>grammatical</b> tracts, and commentaries on the works of other philosophers and theologians.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 500 {{years of}} intense contact between {{speakers}} of Nahuatl and speakers of Spanish, {{combined with the}} minority status of Nahuatl and the higher prestige associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties, {{with large numbers of}} words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl, and the introduction of new syntactic constructions and <b>grammatical</b> categories.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa has {{complex systems}} of both inflectional and derivational {{morphology}}. Inflectional morphology has {{a central role}} in Ottawa grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate <b>grammatical</b> information through the use of prefixes and suffixes that are added to word stems.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes mark <b>grammatical</b> {{person on}} verbs, {{including}} first person, second person, and third person. Nouns use combinations of prefixes and suffixes to indicate possession. Suffixes on nouns mark gender, location, diminutive, pejorative, and other categories. Significant agreement patterns between nouns and verbs involve gender, singular and plural number, {{as well as}} obviation.|$|E
5|$|Scores are {{calculated}} for individual translated segments—generally sentences—by comparing {{them with a}} set of good quality reference translations. Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation's overall quality. Intelligibility or <b>grammatical</b> correctness are not taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Tamil employs agglutinative grammar, where suffixes {{are used}} to mark noun class, number, and case, verb tense and other <b>grammatical</b> categories. Tamil's {{standard}} metalinguistic terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, {{as opposed to the}} Sanskrit that is standard for most Aryan languages.|$|E
5|$|The Nahuatl verb {{is quite}} complex and inflects for many <b>grammatical</b> categories. The verb is {{composed}} of a root, prefixes, and suffixes. The prefixes indicate {{the person of the}} subject, and person and number of the object and indirect object, whereas the suffixes indicate tense, aspect, mood and subject number.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and <b>grammatical</b> description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on <b>grammatical</b> and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{study of}} {{language}} is often {{considered to have}} started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent <b>grammatical</b> traditions developed {{in all of the}} ancient cultures that adopted writing.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} language, linguistics, has been {{developing}} into a science since the first <b>grammatical</b> descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago, after {{the development of the}} Brahmi script. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.|$|E
5|$|The suffix is {{sometimes}} missing, {{which has been}} interpreted as a zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns. Beyond this basic structure, there is the nasal infix, a present tense marker, and reduplication, a sort of prefix {{with a number of}} <b>grammatical</b> and derivational functions.|$|E
5|$|Verbs {{are marked}} for <b>grammatical</b> {{information}} in three distinct sets of inflectional paradigms, called Verb orders. Each order corresponds generally {{to one of}} three main sentence types: the Independent order is used in main clauses, the Conjunct order in subordinate clauses, and the Imperative order in commands.|$|E
5|$|Where other {{languages}} may use <b>grammatical</b> cases, Swedish uses numerous prepositions, {{similar to those}} found in English. As in modern German, prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like till fots ("on foot", genitive).|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} <b>grammatical</b> subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the <b>grammatical</b> subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no <b>grammatical</b> subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
5|$|All {{ethnic groups}} speak Bulgarian, {{either as a}} first or as a second {{language}}. Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85.2 percent of the population. The oldest written Slavic language, Bulgarian is distinguishable from the other languages in this group through certain <b>grammatical</b> peculiarities such as the lack of noun cases and infinitives, and a suffixed definite article.|$|E
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a <b>grammatical</b> form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by <b>grammatical</b> rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the esoteric work La langue hebraïque restituée by Antoine Fabre d'Olivet, he began a semantic and <b>grammatical</b> analysis of Biblical Hebrew. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya {{have been described as}} exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.|$|E
