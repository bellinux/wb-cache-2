5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} the South African government. It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party (SACP).

5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in,</b> regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as leader of La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{reportedly}} gave loans to farmers, funded schools and churches, financed drainage projects, and carried out several aid campaigns to help out the disadvantaged {{in the state of}} Michoacán. This, along with the manpower of the organization, allowed him get the support of several rural sectors in the state, where many served as informants and collaborators for the cartel. His wife was also known for organizing several self-help seminars in Apatzingán. The support of La Familia Michoacana <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> family connections and local communities in Michoacán, and in the supposed exploitation of its citizens by the government.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{enjoyed a}} measure of {{popularity}} throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov's Testimony suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis, but of the Soviet government. The veracity of Volkov's account, which he claims <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it {{was inspired by the}} attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.|$|E

The {{second and third}} chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E

Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E
5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often {{believed to be}} of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music <b>is</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
