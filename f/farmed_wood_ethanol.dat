40|$|Background: Idiopathic male {{infertility}} {{becomes an}} issue {{because of the}} limited management options and increasing number of infertile couples. Sappan wood (Caesalpinia sappan. L) is an herbal plant predicted to have fertility and spermatogenesis enhancing effects through antioxidant properties. This study aimed to observe the effects of sappan <b>wood</b> <b>ethanol</b> extract in improving sperm quality of male wistar rat based on sperm motility, viability, and concentration. Methods: This was an experimental laboratory study by using sappan <b>wood</b> <b>ethanol</b> extracts as material and male wistar rat as the experimental animal. Twenty-four adult male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups including rats which were treated with aquades, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day/orally of ethanol extract of sappan wood, respectively, during 35 days. After this period, the animals were sacrificed. Then the epididymis were taken for samples to calculate sperm motility percentage, sperm viability percentage and sperm concentration. Comparison {{between control group and}} the treated group was analyzed by one-way Annova. Results: There were significant differences between the control group and the group with 120 mg/kg of sappan <b>wood</b> <b>ethanol</b> extracts in the percentage of motility (36. 39 % and 51. 75 %; p-value 0. 001), viability percentage (55. 36 % and 66. 63 %, p-value 0. 031), and sperm concentration (54. 47 million/ml and 47. 79 million/ml; p-value 0. 001). Conclusions: The ethanol extract of sappan wood with a dose of 120 mg/kg for 35 days is able to improve sperm motility percentage, sperm viability percentage, and sperm concentration of male wistar rat.

50|$|During {{the colonial}} period, life in Westchester was quite primitive. Roads were few and in poor condition, and {{transportation}} was {{heavily dependent on}} water. Nearly everything settlers consumed was raised or made on their <b>farms.</b> <b>Wood,</b> cattle and food were bartered for the items the settlers couldn't grow or make themselves. Over time cottage industries, such as shoe and furniture making, sprang up. This led to heavier use of local roads, which encouraged improvements, which in turn spurred increased travel. Taverns catering to travelers were established and ferries were launched. By 1775, Westchester was the richest and most populous county in the colony of New York.|$|R
