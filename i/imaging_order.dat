40|$|Physician {{order entry}} is a {{powerful}} function of a computerized hospital information system. Although designed to be clinician-driven, the imaging section of the order entry system may not be designed optimally to engage the clinician with imaging procedures logically organized for the clinician's typical work patterns. There also may be resistance among overburdened clinicians in having {{to take the time}} to learn a new computer system and to assume “clerk's duties” of entering imaging orders. A potential means to address clinician opposition is to cooperatively engage each clinical service in the design of an <b>imaging</b> <b>order</b> entry system with customized menus for each service. This article reports a step-by-step process for the implementation of an <b>imaging</b> <b>order</b> entry system with specialized menus for an orthopedic service. This implementation process includes (1) identification of key personnel, (2) familiarization with the system, (3) discussion and dialogue between key personnel, (4) addressing specific problems, (5) education and orientation of the target group, (6) initial implementation, (7) feedback and improvement, (8) demonstration project (time study) to foster acceptance, and (9) ongoing enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Classical ghost imaging is a correlation-imaging {{technique}} {{in which the}} image of the object is found through intensity correlations of light. We analyze three different quality parameters, namely the visibility, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), to assess the performance of double- and triple-intensity correlation-imaging setups. The source is a random partially polarized beam of light obeying Gaussian statistics and the image quality is evaluated {{as a function of the}} degree of polarization (DoP). We show that the visibility improves when the DoP and the order of imaging increase, while the SNR behaves oppositely. The CNR is for the most part independent of DoP and the <b>imaging</b> <b>order.</b> The results are important for the development of new imaging devices using partially polarized light.

40|$|INTRODUCTION While only 15 - 20 % of {{patients}} with foot and ankle injuries presenting to urgent care centers have clinically significant fractures, most undergo radiography. We examined the impact of electronic point-of-care clinical decision support (CDS) on adherence to the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) as well as use and yield of foot and ankle radiographs in patients with acute ankle injury. METHODS Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this randomized controlled study performed April 18, 2012 through December 15, 2013.   All ordering providers credentialed at an urgent care affiliated with a quaternary care academic hospital were randomized to either receive or not receive CDS, based on the OAR and integrated into the physician order entry system, with feedback {{at the time of}} <b>imaging</b> <b>order.</b> If the patient met OAR low-risk criteria, providers were advised against imaging and could either cancel the order or ignore the alert. Patients with foot and ankle complaints were identified via ICD- 9 billing codes and electronic health records and radiology reports reviewed for those who were eligible. Chi-square was used to compare adherence to the OAR (primary outcome), radiography utilization rate and radiography yield of foot and ankle imaging (secondary outcomes) between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS Of 14, 642 patients seen at urgent care during the study period, 613 (4. 2 %, representing 632 visits) presented with acute ankle injury and were eligible for application of the OAR; 374 (59. 2 %) of these were seen by control group providers. In the intervention group, CDS adherence was higher for both ankle (239 / 258 = 92. 6 % vs. 231 / 374 = 61. 8 %, p= 0. 02) and foot radiography (209 / 258 = 81. 0 % vs. 238 / 374 = 63. 6 %; p< 0. 01). However, ankle radiography use was higher in the intervention group (166 / 258 = 64. 3 % vs. 183 / 374 = 48. 9 %; p< 0. 01) while foot radiography use (141 / 258 = 54. 6 % vs. 202 / 374 = 54. 0 %; p= 0. 95) was not. Radiography yield was also higher in the intervention group (26 / 307 = 8. 5 % vs. 18 / 385 = 4. 7 %; p= 0. 04). CONCLUSION Clinical Decision Support, previously demonstrated to improve guideline adherence for high-cost imaging, can also improve guideline adherence for radiography – as demonstrated by increased OAR adherence and increase imaging yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} investigates the properties of ordered weighted learning vector quantization (LVQ) and clustering algorithms. These algorithms are developed by using gradient descent to minimize reformulation functions based on aggregation operators. An axiomatic approach provides conditions for selecting aggregation operators that lead to admissible reformulation functions. Minimization of admissible reformulation functions based on ordered weighted aggregation operators produces a family of soft LVQ and clustering algorithms, which includes fuzzy LVQ and clustering algorithms as special cases. The proposed LVQ and clustering algorithms are used to perform segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. The diagnostic value of the segmented MR images provides the basis for evaluating a variety of ordered weighted LVQ and clustering algorithms.

40|$|SummaryMany {{biological}} functions depend critically upon fine {{details of}} tissue molecular architecture that have resisted exploration by existing imaging techniques. This {{is particularly true}} for nervous system tissues, where information processing function depends on intricate circuit and synaptic architectures. Here, we describe a new imaging method, called array tomography, which combines and extends superlative features of modern optical fluorescence and electron microscopy methods. Based on methods for constructing and repeatedly staining and <b>imaging</b> <b>ordered</b> arrays of ultrathin (50 – 200 nm), resin-embedded serial sections on glass microscope slides, array tomography allows for quantitative, high-resolution, large-field volumetric imaging {{of large numbers of}} antigens, fluorescent proteins, and ultrastructure in individual tissue specimens. Compared to confocal microscopy, array tomography offers the advantage of better spatial resolution, in particular along the z axis, as well as depth-independent immunofluorescent staining. The application of array tomography can reveal important but previously unseen features of brain molecular architecture...|$|R
