Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E

5000|$|Flapping {{counter-torque}} is a ubiquitous passive rotational damping {{effect in}} flapping flight that arises from world frame differences <b>in</b> the <b>speed</b> of flapping wings during turns. During a turns, flapping that is symmetrical (<b>in</b> velocity and <b>speed)</b> <b>in</b> the body {{frame of the}} animal is not symmetrical (<b>in</b> velocity or <b>speed)</b> <b>in</b> the lab frame.|$|R
5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|E
5|$|Following several tyre {{failures}} {{before the}} race, most spectacularly on Ralf Schumacher's Toyota during Friday practice and by Ricardo Zonta {{in the other}} Toyota, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that without a reduction <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> in Turn 13, the tyres provided for the race would only be safe for 10 laps. Michelin had been providing working tyres for the race since 2001. The situation was worsened by the 2005 Formula One rules, which forbade tyre changes during the race.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt <b>in</b> <b>speed.</b> Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet can sometimes be observed. It tends to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E
50|$|The 300PL used {{three models}} of {{processors}} during its lifetime, the Pentium MMX, Pentium II and Pentium III. Models using the Pentium MMX came <b>in</b> <b>speeds</b> of 166, 200 and 233 MHz; models using the Pentium II came <b>in</b> <b>speeds</b> of 266, 300, 333, 350, 400 and 450 MHz; and models using the Pentium III came <b>in</b> <b>speeds</b> of 450, 500, 533, 550, 600, 667, 733, 800 and 866 MHz.The 300PL usually shipped {{with a hard}} drive with a capacity ranging from 2 GB to 20 GB, a CD-ROM drive, and a floppy drive. In some models, an IBM EtherJet 10/100 Ethernet network adapter is also included. The IBM 300PL came either in a tower or a desktop form-factor.|$|R

5|$|Little, Brown Young Readers {{published}} {{the next two}} books in April and June 2003. The first, Speed, was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld. The second, Buried Secrets, was written by Suzan Colon. <b>In</b> <b>Speed,</b> a boy uses an hourglass his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit hate crimes without being caught. Clark stops him before he disrupts a local multicultural festival. In Buried Secrets Clark and Lex {{fall in love with}} a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher, jeopardizing their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction <b>in</b> <b>speed.</b> For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the tactile <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> the <b>speed</b> of tactile {{information}} processing (STIP) test of blind pupils. The STIP test measures how fast blind pupils can carry out scanning task in the test. Subjects consist of 53 blinds pupils of 8 - 17 years old attending schools for the blind. To examine tactiie <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test, correlation between tactile <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test and result of cognitive ability tests (WISC-III test, Braille reading speed test, Blind Learning Aptitude Test : BLAT, and Digitspan test) were tested. As results, a negative correlation was found respectively between tactile <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test and WISC-IIIVIQ, between the <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test and braille reading speed test result, between the <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test and BLAT result, and between the <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> STIP test and Digit span test result. Based on these results, the meaning of the tactile <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> the STIP test of blind pupils was discussed...|$|R

5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal increase <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> {{at the cost}} of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the XII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Innsbruck, Austria, from 4 to 15 February 1976. A total of 1,123 athletes {{representing}} 37 National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated in 37 events from 10 different sports and disciplines.

Five new events were contested at these Games—men's and women's Super G in alpine skiing, team events in Nordic combined and ski jumping, and women's 5000metres <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> skating—and two events returned to the program—men's and women's combined in alpine skiing.|$|E
5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> over the earlier vessels.|$|E

5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery.

5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like O(h²). It is generally {{faster than the}} Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases <b>in</b> <b>speed.</b> Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E
