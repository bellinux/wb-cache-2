2500|$|The {{development}} of [...] "simple" [...] theories of field electron emission, {{and in particular}} the {{development of}} Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) {{one or more of the}} above factors will be untrue. For example, crystalline semiconductors do not have a free-electron-like band-structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and band bending, and may exhibit both <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> drops and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk band-structure (this decoupling is known as [...] "the Modinos effect").|$|E

40|$|SEU from heavy-ions is {{measured}} for SOI PowerPC microprocessors. Results for 0. 13 micron PowerPC with 1. 1 V core voltages increases over 1. 3 V versions. This suggests that improvement in SEU for scaled devices may be reversed. In recent years {{there has been}} interest in the possible use of unhardened commercial microprocessors in space because of their superior performance compared to hardened processors. However, unhardened devices are susceptible to upset from radiation space. More information is needed on how they respond to radiation before they can be used in space. Only a limited number of advanced microprocessors have been subjected to radiation tests, which are designed with lower clock frequencies and higher <b>internal</b> core <b>voltage</b> voltages than recent devices [1 - 6]. However the trend for commercial Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microprocessors is to reduce feature size and <b>internal</b> core <b>voltage</b> and increase the clock frequency. Commercial microprocessors with the PowerPC architecture are now available that use partially depleted SOI processes with feature size of 90 nm and <b>internal</b> core <b>voltage</b> as low as 1. 0 V and clock frequency in the GHz range. Previously, we reported SEU measurements for SOI commercial PowerPCs with feature size of 0. 18 and 0. 13 m [7, 8].

50|$|Source resistance. Another {{problem of}} diode logic is the {{internal}} {{resistance of the}} input voltage sources. Together with the gate resistor, it constitutes a voltage divider that worsens the voltage levels. In an OR gate, the source resistance decreases the high voltage level (the logical 1) while in an AND gate, it increases the low voltage level (the logical 0). In the cascaded AND-OR diode gates in {{the picture on the}} right, the AND high output voltages are decreased because of the <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> drops across the AND pull-up resistances.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all digital {{circuits}} use a consistent logic level for all internal signals. That level, however, varies from one system to another. Interconnecting any two logic families often required special {{techniques such as}} additional pull-up resistors or purpose-built interface circuits known as level shifters. A level shifter connects one digital circuit that uses one logic level to another digital circuit that uses another logic level. Often two level shifters are used, one at each system: A line driver converts from internal logic levels to standard interface line levels; a line receiver converts from interface levels to <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> levels.|$|E

For field-free drift lengths between 33 cm to 100 cm, at least unit mass resolution can be maintained solely by adjustment of <b>internal</b> <b>voltages,</b> and without resorting to drastic reductions in sensitivity.

50|$|The {{processor}} module {{featured a}} 10 volt reference for its analog-to-digital converter {{which was used}} to gather data from various sensors. This {{could have been an}} issue as the available power to the module varied above and below 10 volts during engine cranking. The problem was solved by several steps. First, all sensors used a ratiometric measuring method that insured accuracy in spite of varying reference voltage. Second, during cranking, a special circuit triggered the ignition system in synchronization with the reference pulses from the engine. Third, the processor was not allowed to start until the <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> was stabilized above 10 volts.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} these {{batteries}} to survive frequent cycling {{is due to}} the low solubility of the reactants in the electrolyte. The formation of metallic iron during charge is slow because of the low solubility of the ferrous hydroxide. While the slow formation of iron crystals preserves the electrodes, it also limits the high rate performance: these cells charge slowly, and are only able to discharge slowly. Nickel-iron cells should not be charged from a constant voltage supply since they can be damaged by thermal runaway; the cell <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> drops as gassing begins, raising temperature, which increases current drawn and so further increases gassing and temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional battery {{chargers}} use a one-, two-, or three-stage process to recharge the battery, with {{switched-mode power supply}} include more stages in order to fill the battery more rapidly and completely. Common to almost all chargers, including non-switched models, is the middle stage, normally known as [...] "absorption". In this mode the charger holds a steady voltage slightly above that of a filled battery, in order to push current into the cells. As the battery fills, its <b>internal</b> <b>voltage</b> rises towards the fixed voltage being supplied to it, {{and the rate of}} current flow slows.

50|$|Power {{management}} ICs {{are solid}} state devices {{that control the}} flow and direction of electrical power. Many electrical devices have multiple <b>internal</b> <b>voltages</b> (e.g., 5 V, 3.3 V, 1.8 V, etc.) and sources of external power (e.g., wall outlet, battery, etc.), meaning that the power design of the device has multiple requirements for operation. A PMIC can refer to any chip that is an individual power related function, but generally refer to ICs that incorporate more than one function such as different power conversions and power controls such as voltage supervision and undervoltage protection. By incorporating these functions into one IC, a number of improvements to the overall design can be made such as better conversion efficiency, smaller solution size and better heat dissipation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two-port network}} model {{is used in}} {{mathematical}} circuit analysis techniques to isolate portions of larger circuits.

This allows the response of the network to signals applied to the ports to be calculated easily, without solving for all the <b>internal</b> <b>voltages</b> and currents in the network. It also allows similar circuits or devices to be compared easily. For example, transistors are often regarded as two-ports, characterized by their h-parameters (see below) which are listed by the manufacturer. Any linear circuit with four terminals can be regarded as a two-port network provided that it does not contain an independent source and satisfies the port conditions.|$|R
