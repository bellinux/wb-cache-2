40|$|The most {{significant}} case of transnational union bargaining co-ordination in existence {{is in the}} maritime shipping industry. A global union association, the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), and a global employers' federation, the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> Employers' <b>Committee</b> (IMEC), now negotiate over pay scales for seafarers on Flag of Convenience (FOC) ships. These negotiations set the pattern for pay and working conditions for a signifi-cant portion of the global seafaring work-force. The ITF brought about global wage bargaining by building and enforcing a global inter-union consensus between developed and developing countries around a uniform wage rate.
