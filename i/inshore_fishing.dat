50|$|The Lord Howe Island Group {{supports}} a diverse <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> fauna with greater than 400 species recorded. 10% {{of the marine}} <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> species {{are known to be}} endemic, meaning they are only found at Lord Howe Island, while 8% of the 110 species of echinoderms are also endemic. A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.|$|R

500|$|In 1886, another dispute arose over {{fishing rights}} with the United States. Americans {{fishermen}} {{had been using}} treaty provisions allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing.</b> Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, {{to the dismay of}} the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the Governor General, Lord Lansdowne, to reserve Royal Assent for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. [...] After considerable discussion, the British government allowed Royal Assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.|$|E
500|$|The harbour has a {{total area}} of about [...] {{and is used}} by commercial, fishing and {{pleasure}} craft. <b>Inshore</b> <b>fishing,</b> particularly for crustaceans and line fish, takes place along the coast. Lobsters, brown and velvet crabs {{are important to the}} local fishery. From May to August, salmon is found in the Esk and small open boats are licensed to net these off the harbour entrance. There are around 40 licensed angling party boats. The commercial catch is no longer herring but has been replaced by cod, haddock, and other fish caught within [...] of the coast. A fish market on the quayside operates as need arises. The ready supply of fresh fish has resulted in an abundance of [...] "chippies" [...] in the town, including the Magpie Cafe which Rick Stein has described as the best fish and chip shop in Britain.|$|E
30|$|Vibrio parahaemolyticus was {{isolated}} from the internal organs of diseased sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultured in a marine cage farm and an <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> farm in the summer 2010. All strains isolated from diseased sea bass were tested for virulence by intraperitoneal injection. The isolates (n[*]=[*] 6) were pathogenic for sea bass. Only bacterial strains showing haemolytic activity were virulent. LD 50 values ranged from 3.52 [*]×[*] 104 to 2.29 [*]×[*] 106  cfu fish− 1. In this study, we report the characterization and the virulence of V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from sea bass originating from two different fish farms (marine cage farm and <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> farm in Tunisia).|$|R

2500|$|By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood {{began to}} decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961. The sailings have been revived {{periodically}} since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 {{as a result of}} the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. This in turn was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway bed. The rise of package holidays abroad led to fewer visitors generally to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back, and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood's trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> boats fish out of the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is still a big industry in the town, though the jobs are mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze [...] on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea.|$|E
6000|$|The course {{pursued by}} the Canadian {{authorities}} toward the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States {{it was agreed that}} the inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not included in the limits named in the convention (within 3 miles of parts of the British coast) it has been the custom for many years to give to intruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial Government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> grounds to the colonial authority known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without notice or warning, in violation of the custom previously prevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up, and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within 3 marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canada into port, to search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given; and if such a vessel is found [...] "preparing to fish" [...] within 3 marine miles of any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, etc., shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary {{to protect the rights of}} the citizens of the United States.|$|E

25|$|Coastal <b>fish,</b> {{also called}} <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> or neritic fish, inhabit the sea between the {{shoreline}} and {{the edge of}} the continental shelf. Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic coastal fish are generally epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone. Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|R
50|$|The duskyshoulder {{trevally}} or epaulet trevally, Carangoides humerosus, is {{a species}} of small <b>inshore</b> marine <b>fish</b> in the jack family, Carangidae. It is distributed through the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans, ranging from eastern India to northern Australia and Taiwan. It is relatively small by carangid standards, reaching only 27 cm maximum length, and can be distinguished by the large, black blotches on its shoulders. The duskyshoulder trevally is an <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> living in waters less than 50 m deep, over sandy substrates in bays and on the continental shelf. It is a predatory fish, taking demersal fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods, with nothing known of its reproductive habits. It is of little value to fisheries, often taken as bycatch in prawn trawling operations.|$|R
