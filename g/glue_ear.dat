40|$|Bayesian {{inference}} presupposes that practitioners' {{belief in}} the effectiveness of medical intervention {{is the product of}} prior belief and recent evidence from studies. Although increasingly used, up to now the posterior belief calculated according to the theorem has not been compared with an empirically measured posterior belief. We conducted a RCT, which was preceded by elicitation of prior beliefs among ENT-surgeons, and which was followed by elicitation of posterior beliefs among ENT-surgeons, 1 year after completion of the trial. We compared the posterior beliefs of ENT-surgeons about the effect of grommets in children with <b>glue</b> <b>ears,</b> as predicted by Bayes' theorem with actual measured posterior beliefs. The distribution of the measured posterior beliefs was not in line with the calculated posterior, but almost identical to the distribution of the measured prior beliefs. The results showed that our trial had little or no impact on the beliefs of the ENT-surgeons, i. e. they did not adjust their belief to the extent that was expected according to Bayes' theorem...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{observed}} {{posterior probability}} distributions regarding {{the benefits of}} surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME) with expected probability distributions, using Bayes' theorem are compared. METHODS: Postal questionnaires {{were used to assess}} prior and posterior probability distributions among ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgeons in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In their prior probability estimates, ENT surgeons were quite optimistic with respect to the effectiveness of tube insertion in the treatment of OME. The trial showed no meaningful benefit of tubes on hearing and language development. Posterior probabilities calculated on the basis of prior probability estimates and trial results differed widely from those, elicited empirically 1 year after completion of the trial and dissemination of the results. CONCLUSIONS: ENT surgeons did not adjust their opinion about the benefits of surgical treatment of <b>glue</b> <b>ears</b> {{to the extent that they}} should have done according to Bayes' theorem. Users of the results of Bayesian analyses, notably policy-makers, should realize that Bayes' theorem is prescriptive and not necessarily descriptively correct.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Glue</b> <b>ear</b> (otitis {{media with}} effusion) {{is the most}} common reason for {{surgical}} intervention in children. AIM: To determine the yield and predictive value of a set of risk factors that predict persistence of <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> over the interval from general practice referral to ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultation to ensure the appropriateness of referrals. DESIGN OF STUDY: Nested case control study SETTING: Sixteen ENT departments in the UK. METHOD: With the aid of audiometry and tympanometry, diagnostic information was collected on 548 children from 16 ENT departments after referral by their general practitioner (GP), as a lead-in to a clinical trial, the Trial of Alternative Regimens in <b>Glue</b> <b>Ear</b> Treatment (TARGET). Using cases and controls, children were classified as either having or not having persistent <b>glue</b> <b>ear.</b> Parental reports on an extensive list of risk factors were also collected. RESULTS: After adjustment for time waiting to be seen from GP referral and age at referral, four main significant factors emerged for persistence of <b>glue</b> <b>ear.</b> These were: referral between July and December (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 73, 95 % CI = 1. 15 to 2. 6); having a mother who smokes ten or more cigarettes per day (OR = 1. 7, 95 % CI = 1. 1 to 2. 8); multiple upper airway symptoms (OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 5 to 3. 2; and siblings with a history of <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> (OR = 1. 6 for one sibling versus none). CONCLUSION: For a child who is referred between July and December; who has two or more upper airway symptoms, who has a sibling who has had <b>glue</b> <b>ear,</b> and who has a mother who smokes ten or more cigarettes per day, the odds of having persistent <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> are over ten times that of a child without adverse values on these factors...|$|E

40|$|Background Otitis {{media is}} the most common reason for {{children}} to receive antibiotics, but there is no evidence about the effect of prescribing on reattendance. Aim To evaluate the changing workload of middle ear disease in general practice, and the impact on surgery reattendance of prescribing antibiotics at first attendance. Design of study A case-linked cohort analysis for antibiotic prescribing versus no prescribing at first consultation event. Setting Two hundred and ninety-one practices spread throughout the UK recording for the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and incorporating individual patient data records for 2 265 574 patients. Method All middle ear disease coded events that can be classed within acute otitis media (AOM) or <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> sub-categories (and excluding chronic suppurative otitis media) were selected for analysis when the first event was from 1991 – 2001. The effect of antibiotic prescription on the risk of reattendance using Cox proportional hazards regression was analysed. Results Total consultations for AOM have fallen markedly over this decade, and <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> consultations have risen but by a much smaller extent (26 000 decrease versus 4000 increase in consultations per year), which makes re-labelling an unlikely explanation of the fall in AOM consultations. In the 2 – 10 years age range, consultations for AOM fell from 105. 3 to 34. 7 per 1000 per year, with <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> consultations unaltered (15. 2 to 16. 7 per 1000 per year). Antibiotic prescribing for AOM has stayed remarkably constant (80 – 84 % of consultations), but antibiotic prescribing for <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> has risen sharply (13 to 62 %). Prescribing antibiotics increased the risk of reattendance for AOM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 07 to 1. 10) and has reduced the risk of reattendance for <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> (HR = 0. 92, 95 % CI = 0. 88 to 0. 96). Conclusion Prescribing antibiotics for AOM probably increased reattendance, but the opposite effect has been noted for <b>glue</b> <b>ear,</b> which suggests a treatment effect of antibiotics in <b>glue</b> <b>ear.</b> Further research is needed to clarify whether this possible benefit is worth the known harms, and if so in which subgroups of children...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{describe}} {{the progress of}} the epidemic of surgery for <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> since 1983 and trends in the use of different operative procedures. DESIGN [...] Analysis of routine hospital data. SETTING [...] Thirteen health districts in the Oxford and East Anglian regions. MAIN MEASURES [...] Annual rates of surgery in children under 10 years of age. RESULTS [...] The rate of surgery for <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> reached a peak in 1986 since when it has declined by 12. 6 %. The rate peaked in all 13 districts but at different times over a six year period (1984 - 1989 / 90). Following the peak, district rates plateaued in eight districts and declined in five. These changes have been accompanied by: an increase in the proportion of operations confined to the tympanic membrane since 1983 (from 40 % to 60 %); an increase in the use of grommets after myringotomy (from 50 % to 94 % since 1980); and an increased use of day surgery for ear-only operations (from about 10 % in the late 1970 s to 50 % in 1987 / 88).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} time to {{spontaneous}} resolution of severe chronic otitis media with effusion (<b>glue</b> <b>ear)</b> in children and {{study the effects of}} adenoidectomy, adenotonsillectomy, and ventilation tubes (grommets). DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled study over 12 years. SETTING [...] Paediatric otorhinolaryngology clinics and in-patient unit. SUBJECTS [...] 228 children aged 2 - 9 years with pronounced hearing loss from <b>glue</b> <b>ear</b> and persistent bilateral middle ear effusions confirmed on three occasions over three months. INTERVENTIONS [...] Children were randomly allocated to adenotonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or neither procedure. In all groups a Shepard type ventilation tube was inserted in one randomly chosen ear. Follow up was annually for five years and then less often for up to seven years four months. For analysis the two operated groups were combined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Otoscopic clearance of fluid, change in tympanogram, and improvement in mean audiometric hearing threshold. RESULTS [...] Survival analysis showed appreciable otoscopic and tympanometric resolution of fluid with ventilation tubes alone and adenoidectomy alone compared with no surgery. Further improvement was seen after combination of both treatments. Mean audiometric hearing thresholds improved with fluid resolution. Resolution was delayed in younger children and in those whose parents smoked, irrespective of treatment. Whereas a single insertion of a Shepard tube resolved the glue for a mean (SD) period of 9. 5 (5. 2) months, the effect of adenoidectomy was sustained throughout follow up.
