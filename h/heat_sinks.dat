25|$|A {{heat sink}} (also {{commonly}} spelled heatsink) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, {{where it is}} dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at optimal levels. In computers, <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors. <b>Heat</b> <b>sinks</b> are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.|$|E

25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and {{the edges of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This nonuniformity increases the <b>heat</b> <b>sink's</b> effective thermal resistance.|$|R
