5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
5|$|Other French {{leaders were}} {{directly}} {{influenced by the}} text of the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence (1811), the Liberian <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence was issued {{at the time}} and the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E

40|$|The essay {{concerns}} the reservations {{attached to the}} declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the two International Courts. As early as during the 1920 s when States consented to the compulsory jurisdicition of the first World Court they attached limitations on, conditions or reservations to their <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance. For these declarations, there were no rules whatever prescribing any sort of uniformity or similarity of content in any aspects, and States formulated more and more complicated restrictions to their <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance. After the International Court of Justice had been established, States continued the practice of attaching reservations to <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance and, moreover, increased the number thereof, “inventing” more and more complicated reservations. Quite a few of such reservations placed much more limitations on the Court's compulsory jurisdiction than the interwar <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance had done and a no small part of them left loopholes of escape from the jurisdiction recognized. In analysing the problems of permissible reservations, the author refers to the rules and criterias developed in international treaty law on the reservations to multilateral treaties and to the jurisprudence of the two Word Courts. She concludes that the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance are unilateral acts and the States are free to attach any reservation to their <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> acceptance. ...|$|R

Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E

Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
