The reported data can be rationalized by assuming that, after the initial desorption mainly involving mols. absorbed in the amorphous phase, most gaseous mols. are included as guest in the nanoporous-cryst. phase. This allows establishing a simple method to evaluate guest partition between nanoporous-cryst. and amorphous polymeric phases, which possibly can be applied for most volatile guest mols.

The highest loading capacities (up to 36 <b>guest</b> <b>mols.</b> per mol. of polymer) were, as expected, found for the 6 -arm star-shaped polymers. The densely grafted poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] [p(mPEGMA) ] shell stabilizes the host-guest complexes preventing undesired multimol. aggregation.

In such cases, the molar loading qi at any temp. T and pressure pi, is a unique function of (pi/Pisat) where Pisat is the satd. vapor pressure at T.

40|$|Small angle X-ray {{scattering}} (SAXS) expts. {{were performed}} on dil. aq. solns. of {{a new type of}} water-sol. ethyleneoxy-terminated poly(propyleneimine) dendrimer system. They reveal that the dimensions and d. distributions of the dendrimer are hardly affected by a change in the degree of protonation. This is in contrast to recent predictions regarding the structure of polyelectrolyte dendrimers but in line with the results of recent structural studies on charged PAMAM dendrimers. These dendrimer systems were applied as nanosized containers for guests like xanthene dyes. Structural studies with SAXS provide clear evidence for a complex formation but despite higher molar mass the max. dimensions of the complex are only slightly changed compared to the dendritic host. Since the radius of gyration represents the second moment of the electron d. distribution it appears to be very sensitive to changes in this distribution upon encapsulation of heavy-atom contg. <b>guest</b> <b>mols.</b> These are reflected in a decrease of the radius of gyration upon an increase of the guest-host ratio in the soln., a behavior that strongly indicates an accumulation of <b>guest</b> <b>mols.</b> {{in the center of the}} dendritic host.
