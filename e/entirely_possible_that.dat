40|$|Traditionally, {{commentators}} of Corot's late historical landscapes {{dismissed the}} subject matter of these works as irrelevant accessories added merely to increase their popularity and marketability. It is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> however, <b>that</b> Corot consciously chose {{the subject matter}} of these late historical landscapes, particularly the six paintings incorporating Orpheus and Eurydice, to reflect his feelings about life in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, the role of the artist in society, and the effect of change on the artist. A critical examination of Corot's artistic background, of the commentaries on his work, and of the multifaceted Orpheus myth provides insight into the role subject matter played in these reflections...|$|R

25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, {{it may be useful}} to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the diminishing}} number {{of scholars who}} believe Kyot was real tend to identify him with Guiot de Provins. The names Kyot and Guiot are cognate, but the historical poet was not from the southern French region of Provence, but the northern town of Provins, and none of Guiot's surviving works deal with the Holy Grail or suggest any thematic relation with Parzival. Some aspects of Parzival may hint at a source besides Wolfram's imagination and Chrétien, such as an implied knowledge of French literature and a reverence for the House of Anjou, {{but none of these}} obstacles are better explained as deriving from an authentic Kyot than from an extraordinary mind with broad interests. It is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> however, <b>that</b> Wolfram intended his character to be Guiot, and attached fictitious information to him, or else just used his name.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that disturbances in mitochondrial function are associated with rare childhood disorders and possibly with many common diseases of ageing, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia. There has also been increasing evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction with tumorigenesis. Recently, heterozygous germline mutations in two enzymes of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) {{have been shown to}} predispose individuals to tumours. The two enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are ubiquitously expressed, playing a vital role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production through the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Germline mutations in FH are associated with leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, whilst SDH mutations are associated with predisposition to paraganglioma (PGL) and phaeochromocytoma (PCC). At present, there are few data to explain the pathway(s) involved in this predisposition to neoplasia through TCA cycle defects. We shall review the mechanisms by which mutations in FH and SDH might play a role in tumorigenesis. These include pseudo-hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired apoptosis, oxidative stress and anabolic drive. All of these mechanisms are currently poorly defined. To date, FH and SDH mutations have not been reported in non-familial leiomyomata, renal cancers, PCCs or PGLs. It remains <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> however, <b>that</b> the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis in these sporadic tumours are the same as those in the Mendelian syndromes...|$|R
25|$|It is also <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> homochirality {{is simply}} {{a result of the}} natural autoamplification process of life —that either the {{formation}} of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices. The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was able}} to turn to the {{specifics}} of the case, Olinger reminded the justices that Hogan had agreed that, other than Doyle's contact with WSAI, the board had ample reason not to renew his contract. The rest of the argument focused on the jurisdictional issues. Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries at Mt. Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made {{over the course of several}} years of employment; however he said it was <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Doyle's potential top salary step at his new school would be higher than it might be at Mt.

25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If one person can misremember, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; {{but the next day}} both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
5000|$|Gibson is {{the primary}} author of the [...] "Chiefs version" [...] {{endorsed}} by the Council of Chiefs of Six Nations of the Grand River reserve in counterpoint to Seth Newhouse's earlier version. It was rendered in English by the committee of the Council itself. It was later published - first by Duncan Campbell Scott in 1911, and then by Arthur C. Parker in 1916. The only significant {{difference between these two}} is that Parker's version introduced punctuation marks. Both include the original introduction included with the version the council endorsed; however Kimura argues that the commentary about borrowing miraculous qualities from Christianity was introduced at a second meeting of the committee at which Gibson was not present and some Christian Chiefs were. Add that Gibson was viewed as a traditionalist and a Handsome Lake Code leader, viewed as a reaction against Christianity, and it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to conclude <b>that</b> the claim of borrowing from Christianity was used by Christians chiefs to give priority to their religion. Regardless of the introduction, Gibson's [...] "Chiefs version" [...] was considered authoritative and Parker's publication has been echoed many times on the internet.|$|R

25|$|After Fouchier {{offered an}} article {{describing}} this {{work to the}} leading academic journal Science, the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) recommended against publication of the full details of the study, and the one submitted to Nature by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin describing related work. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers. However, then the Dutch government declared {{that this type of}} manuscripts required Fouchier to apply for an export permit in the light of EU directive 428/2009 on dual use goods. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied (under formal protest) with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal Science devoted to H5N1. The papers by Fouchier and Kawaoka conclude that it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> a natural chain of mutations could lead to an H5N1 virus acquiring the capability of airborne transmission between mammals, and that a H5N1 influenza pandemic would not be impossible.|$|E
500|$|In addition, it {{was also}} <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> those governments had based their {{policies}} in part on public opinion.

Officials in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states held regular informal majlises (مجلس) and the Egyptian government took note of what was said at neighborhood discussion centers known as [...] "listening posts." [...] Some also consulted opinion polls.

500|$|According to {{historian}} Luciano Revoredo, {{the preparation}} of pisco with lemon dates {{as far back as}} the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the Mercurio Peruano which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's Plaza de toros de Acho, the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named Punche (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian Pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook Manual de Cocina a la Criolla; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that [...] "t is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy R. Jehangiri {{criticized the}} Court's ruling {{for failing to}} account for {{psychological}} pressures inherent in the [...] "perceived legitimacy of the [...] authority".

Likewise, Marissa Reich also argued that passengers feel significant [...] "psychological pressures" [...] to cooperate with police searches on buses, and police should therefore warn passengers that consent is voluntary. Joshua Fitch also criticized the Court for ignoring the impact of [...] "racial disparagement" [...] with respect to an individual's ability to walk away from encounters with police. He argued that [...] "iven the historical treatment of black males by members of law enforcement, it is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Drayton and Brown feared refusing the officers' requests because they feared violent consequences". Fitch also argued that police should provide warnings similar to Miranda warnings that [...] "inform citizens of their right to refuse consent", and that decisions like Drayton [...] "consistently [...] rules that require citizens to fend for themselves when it comes to constitutional rights".|$|E

5000|$|Barwise's {{political}} career {{was defined by}} his championing of a controversial amendment to the state constitution prohibiting {{the use of any}} public funds by private institutions. [...] "The Barwise Bill" [...] was widely interpreted as an attack on Maine's growing Catholic school system by the Protestant majority, and was called a [...] "Klan measure" [...] by one newspaper. Although Barwise's ties to the Ku Klux Klan (if any) are unknown, Maine saw significant Klan activity in the 1920s, directed against the local Catholic population, which the controversy surrounding the Barwise Bill only helped inflame. It is <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> also, <b>that</b> Barwise was happy to help inflame this controversy. Within Spiritualist publications, Barwise was an outspoken opponent of the Catholic Church in America, particularly when any representative of the Church opposed legislation Barwise championed. For example, when Cardinal O'Connell declared the Church's opposition to compulsory prohibition, Barwise accused Catholic Church officials of requiring American Catholics to [...] "regard themselves as Catholics first and Americans second," [...] and be willing to oppose civil law when it conflicts with church doctrine. [...] "Real Americans," [...] Barwise argued, have [...] "first allegiance [...] [...] [...] to the Constitution, and not to a Prince of a Foreign Potentate who happens to live in a cathedral palace in Boston." [...] Whatever his opinions of the Catholic Church were, however, Barwise's relationship to the Klan remained ambiguous. In 1923, during what one politician called [...] "temporary hysteria" [...] over increased Klan activity in the Maine, Barwise contributed to the downfall of an anti-Klan bill that he had helped author ("an act to prevent crime by persons masked or disguised") by giving it only [...] "half-hearted support" [...] when it was presented. [...] When asked whether he believed the bill should be enacted, he stated that, while he did care about law and order, he did not care [...] "about the squabbles between the Klan and the Knights of Columbus." [...] "I do not think this legislation is really necessary," [...] he concluded. The bill died in committee.|$|R
