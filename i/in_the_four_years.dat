5|$|Four {{years after}} the Brood War, the Dominion is once again the {{dominant}} Terran power in the Koprulu sector.

For reasons unknown, Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished from sight. With the Zerg gone, the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara, Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion, captained by Matt Horner, Raynor's second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{transformation}} <b>in</b> South African {{higher education}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 20 {{years has been}} earmarked by mass participation (almost 80 % growth). <b>The</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school curriculum and increased pass rates at school level place the transition from school to university under the magnifying glass. Universities are confronted with underprepared entering students and are designing interventions and models to maintain standards and increase graduation numbers. The latest suggestion of a Flexible curriculum proposes that an additional <b>year</b> (i. e. <b>four</b> <b>year</b> BSc degree) is more beneficial and advantageous to many first year students {{as opposed to the}} three year BSc. degree option. The Faculty of Science at the University of Johannesburg has been enrolling students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BSc Life and Environmental Science programme (<b>four</b> <b>year</b> degree) which provides students with an opportunity to complete the one semester module in Biology (mainstream) over two semesters, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> offering. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> degree programme, students also start with the Biology module after completion of a generic first semester of bridging and not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first semester when they enter university. This research compares the success of students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two streams (three year programme where students complete <b>the</b> Biology module <b>in</b> one semester to <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> programme where <b>the</b> students complete the one module of Biology over two semesters. Appropriate inferential statistics were employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comparison of the 2011 – 2013 cohorts (sample of 389 foundation and 457 mainstream entries).

5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third {{was built in the}} Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E
5|$|UK Sport, the {{organisation}} responsible for distributing National Lottery funding to elite sport, set Team GB {{a target of}} winning three medals, of any colour, at the Vancouver Games; two more than the single silver medal won in Turin by Shelley Rudman. If achieved {{this would have been}} the best performance by a British Winter Olympics team since 1936 when a gold, silver and bronze medal were won. The target was set following £6.5 million of funding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> leading up to the Games. Whilst no particular events were targeted as potential sources of medals, the success of British athletes in the previous four years was taken into account when setting the target; the men's curling team and the two-woman bobsleigh team, Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke, won world championships, and in 2008 Kristan Bromley became the first man in the history of bob skeleton to win the World Championship, European Championship and World Cup in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The 1931 British Census {{recorded}} {{more than}} 1,000 Cypriot-born people, {{but many of}} these were the children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean. However, some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s, often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho. By the start of the Second World War, there were around 8,000 Cypriots in London. More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA)'s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece, which started in 1955. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of conflict, an average of 4,000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK, because of violence on the island and the fear felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities. Migration peaked following independence in 1960, with around 25,000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed. Many migrants joined family already living in Britain. Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. Home Office figures show that roughly 10,000 Cypriots fled to the UK, the majority of them refugees, but many of them subsequently returned to the island.|$|E

5|$|The Ashes {{series was}} the only one of seven series that Australia failed to win since Davidson became the team's {{frontline}} strike bowler in 1957–58. Of the 33 Tests in this period, Australia won 16, lost four, drew 12 and tied one. Davidson missed one of the drawn games through injury and broke down mid-match in another two. In the five years that he and Benaud led Australia's bowling attack, the pair totalled 333 wickets; Davidson 170 at 19.25 and Benaud 163 at 25, and were a major part in Australia's return to the forefront of world cricket. This came after the first four years of Davidson's career saw Australia win none and lose seven matches out of twelve. Often bowling in tandem, Davidson's accuracy also forced opposition batsmen to attack Benaud, leading them to perish from the pressure to raise the run rate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> after Davidson retired, Australia struggled without his wicket-taking ability. Only one of the six series was won and two were lost; in all Australia managed six wins and eight losses in 30 Tests. Davidson was at his best when Australia was on her knees; In the four Test losses during the last five years of his career, he took 32 wickets at an average of just 13.9 including a ten wicket haul. In the Tied Test, he took eleven wickets, the other ten wicket haul in his Test career.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent.
