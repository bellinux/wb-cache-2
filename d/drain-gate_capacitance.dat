40|$|Abslruct-Submicrometer-gate MESFET’s were {{fabricated}} with a GaAs {{active layer}} and an AI,Ga,,As buffer layer grown by metalor-ganic vapor-phase epitaxy. To investigate {{the role of}} the buffer layer on device performance, FET’s with GaAs and AI,,Gal,,As buffer lay-ers were compared. Electron Hall mobility in the n-GaAs active layer was found to be uueffected by the AI composition or carrier concentra-tion in the buffer layer. However, a remarkable improvement in the maximum available gain of as much as 5. 2 dB was obtained at 26. 5 GHz for FET’s with a p-Alo>Gal, As buffer layer, which was 1. 5 dB higher than those with a p-GaAs buffer layer. The improvement in the maximum available gain is due to a 20 - 30 percent reduction in both drain conductance and <b>drain-gate</b> <b>capacitance</b> at microwave fre-quency. aAs MESFET’s with AI,,Ga,-, A s buffer layers are G expected to perform better than those with GaA...|$|E
40|$|General {{conditions}} for minimizing the noise figure of any linear two-port are reviewed before considering the specific {{case of a}} MOSFET low-noise amplifier (LNA). It is shown that the minimum noise figure cannot be obtained over an arbitrarily large bandwidth with networks of low order. For narrowband operation, however, one may construct simple amplifiers whose noise figure and power gain {{are close to the}} theoretical optima allowed within an explicit power constraint, and which simultaneously present a specified impedance to the driving source. The effects of overlap (<b>drain-gate)</b> <b>capacitance,</b> short-channel carrier heating, substrate resistance ("epi noise"), and gate interconnect resistance are also considered. Amplifier noise figures of 1. 5 dB or better at 10 mW are achievable in the 1 - 2 GHz range with 0. 5 m technology, and improve with scaling. 1. INTRODUCTION That the signals delivered by the antenna in modern wireless systems can be in the submicrovolt range underscores the acute nee [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{materials}} {{present a}} number of advantages over silicon that make them ideal candidates for modest performance devices like active matrix backplanes and RFID tags. The work detailed here describes both structural characterization of promising new materials, {{as well as the}} adaptation of impedance spectroscopy techniques to the study of organic transistors. Unit cells and solution casting behavior for dioctyl- and didodecyl-pentathienoacene are presented. Dioctyl pentathienoacene has an orthorhombic lattice with parameters a = 1. 15 nm, b = 0. 43 nm and c = 3. 05 nm. Didodecyl pentathienoacene has an monoclinic lattice with parameters γ = 92. 2 º, a = 1. 10 nm, b = 0. 42 nm and c = 3. 89 nm. Additionally, thermotropic phase behavior is detailed. Both materials exhibit a “side chain melting” transition—characterized by a dramatic unit cell contraction of more than 20 %—and smectic C liquid crystal phases. The side chain melting transition shows similarity to phase transitions elicited by exposing these materials to high energy electron flux. In both cases, disorder in the substitutions results in new phases for these materials. Dioctyl-pentathienoacene also exhibits a unique phase, which is intermediately ordered and shows a threefold increase in critical dose over the as-cast phase. Impedance spectroscopy of triisopropylsilyl pentacene transistors suggests these devices are well fit by a Voigt model equivalent circuit. The gate bias dependent resistor represents the channel conductance and the capacitor represents the <b>drain-gate</b> and source-gate <b>capacitances.</b> This in turn suggests that conduction occurs through delocalized states available in ordered regions, with disordered regions contributing localized, immobile states. Impedance spectroscopy of poly(2, 5 -bis(3 -alkylthiophen- 2 -yl) thieno[3, 2 - b]thiophene) shows similar behavior. The use of variable temperature impedance spectroscopy is also demonstrated. This technique is used to measure the reduction in trap energy—from 200 meV to 140 meV—produced by annealing the material in its liquid crystal phase...|$|R
