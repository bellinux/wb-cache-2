5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal <b>intubation</b> {{is easier than}} the {{nasotracheal}} route. Nasotracheal <b>intubation</b> carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal <b>intubation</b> route is preferable to orotracheal <b>intubation</b> in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged <b>intubation</b> because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal <b>intubation</b> in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|The lighted stylet is {{a device}} that employs the {{principle}} of transillumination to facilitate blind orotracheal <b>intubation</b> (an <b>intubation</b> technique in which the laryngoscopist does not view the glottis).|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult <b>intubation.</b> Previous experiences with tracheal <b>intubation,</b> especially difficult <b>intubation,</b> <b>intubation</b> for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E

The American Heart Association (AHA) affirmed the importance of using capnography to verify tube placement in their 2005 CPR and ECG Guidelines.|$|R
30|$|This is a {{retrospective}} study of tracheal <b>intubations</b> conducted at a tertiary academic hospital. This analysis included all <b>intubations</b> {{performed by the}} medical emergency team in the general ward during a 48 -month period.|$|R

5|$|Tracheal <b>intubation</b> can be {{associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated}} with potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized <b>intubation</b> of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal <b>intubation.</b> Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal <b>intubation</b> in the {{emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic <b>intubation.</b> Fiberoptic <b>intubation</b> under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in {{the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal <b>intubation</b> is {{generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal <b>intubation</b> requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E

5|$|Diagnostic or {{therapeutic}} {{manipulation of}} the airway (such as bronchoscopy, laser therapy or stenting of the bronchi) may intermittently interfere {{with the ability to}} breathe; <b>intubation</b> may be necessary in such situations.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal <b>intubation</b> to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, <b>intubation</b> should be expected to be difficult.|$|E

5|$|<b>Intubation</b> may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, <b>intubation</b> is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt <b>intubation,</b> especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal <b>intubation,</b> including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the <b>Intubation</b> Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of <b>intubation.</b> It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal <b>intubation.</b> In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal <b>intubation</b> is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, <b>intubation</b> of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
30|$|Three {{previous}} studies performed cost-effectiveness or cost-minimization analysis to compare reusable flexible scopes with single-use scopes. Gupta et al. [10] and Aïssou et al. [11] concluded that single-use scopes {{should be considered}} as alternative devices and that their cost range was similar to reusable scopes. Tvede et al. [12] reported that single-use scopes were more expensive than reusable scopes in their institution, but this depended on the number of flexible optic <b>intubations</b> per year; the cost for disposable scopes was lower if there were only few <b>intubations</b> per year. However, these studies had several limitations, in that they did not consider all costs or cost discounting and they did not perform sensitivity analyses.|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind <b>intubation</b> of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital <b>intubation</b> may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital <b>intubation</b> may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal <b>intubation</b> is not {{a simple}} {{procedure}} and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with <b>intubation.</b> Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, <b>intubation</b> of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal <b>intubation</b> must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal <b>intubation,</b> usually simply {{referred}} to as <b>intubation,</b> is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal <b>intubations</b> involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. Since its introduction by Kirstein in 1895, the conventional laryngoscope has been the most popular device used for this purpose. Today, the conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries with a light source, and a set of interchangeable blades.|$|R
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for <b>intubation</b> of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal <b>intubation</b> to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial <b>intubation,</b> or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal <b>intubation,</b> or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged <b>intubation</b> and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal <b>intubation</b> to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal <b>intubation</b> as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, {{this study}} had some limitations. There might be subtle biases {{which can be}} missed because of {{eventual}} successful endotracheal <b>intubations</b> for each patient.
