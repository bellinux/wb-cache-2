The destroyers were {{accompanied}} by motor torpedo boats MTB 295, MTB 287 and MTB 274, motor gun boats MGB 642, MGB 638 and MGB 633 and motor launch ML494. The destroyers were tasked with landing a team of South African coast watchers on the north tip of Rab, the MTBs with patrolling the Kvarner Gulf between Rab and Krk islands, {{while the rest of}} the force loitered southwest, near Premuda.

5|$|The Economist Intelligence Unit, the {{business}} information {{arm of the}} Economist Group, gathered results from two internet questionnaires, one of business schools and one of their students and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. <b>Information</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and alumni network. Results were tabulated using a smoothing method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, {{with the result that}} some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.|$|E

5|$|Training {{also took}} place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large {{condensers}} of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and mock-ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on <b>information</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation {{was considered to be}} extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test. The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits for this production are fragmentary like many 1910 Thanhouser productions. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The role of Willie Stone was played by Marie Eline. This film was another example of Eline cast in the role of a boy. Eline's with the first such credit was as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland. If the cast <b>information</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> The Monroe News-Star is accurate, it represents the earliest credit of Mignon Anderson for the Thanhouser Company. If it is not, the first known credit for would be four months later in Robert Emmet in March 1911. The film would also be an early credit of William Garwood, who was among the most important actors at Thanhouser. He joined the company in late 1909 and remained until 1911 before returning in 1912. His previous and first credited work with Thanhouser was Jane Eyre.|$|E
