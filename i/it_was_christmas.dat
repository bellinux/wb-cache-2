500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is {{the first}} episode in which Kenny was not killed. Parker and Stone {{deliberately}} included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> {{that they would not}} kill him. The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 2004, Vidal started {{catching}} the media's attention by covering one of Lai's classic hits, [...] "Long Distance" [...] (情深說話未曾講) in English. The cover song quickly became a hit. Some fans initially {{thought it was an}} overseas singer who was covering one of Lai's classic hits, but were surprised to find out the singer was an unknown Hong Kong rookie. Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas,</b> her first song was swiftly followed by a Christmas version of another Lai song, [...] "Bu Ke Yi Shi" [...] (不可一世), sung in Cantonese. The Cantonese cover of [...] "Long Distance" [...] (情深說話未曾講) was aired on radio in Spring 2005 for the first time.|$|E

On 28 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte told The Daily Telegraph {{that she had}} recorded several new tracks, with her single [...] "All We Have" [...] expected to be released soon. She said, [...] "Everything is coming together…I did lose my mojo for a while, I just didn't believe in doing something unless you're totally up for it. I wasn't feeling creative and then, suddenly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> and it just felt right". [...] "All We Have" [...] was released in September 2011 and it failed to chart. In February 2012, Bassingthwaighte was announced as a Moomba Monarch alongside Harry Kewell, the Australian socceroo. In December 2014, Bassingthwaighte and other Australian singers recorded a cover version of Kate Bush's [...] "This Woman's Work" [...] under the name [...] "Hope for Isla and Jude", and released it as a charity single to help raise funds for two siblings who suffer from the rare disease Sanfilippo syndrome. In September 2015, Bassingthwaighte reunited with her former band Rogue Traders, performing {{together for the first}} time in seven years, at a corporate show in Gold Coast. They later reunited again in December for a New Year's Eve show, where they hinted at the possibility of future shows, and confirmed that Bassingthwaighte's former replacement Mindi Jackson had given the band's reunion her blessing.|$|E

60|$|As {{the three}} men passed {{out of the door}} it came dimly to Morganson that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve. That was the date. That was what he had come to Minto for. But it was overshadowed now by {{the three men}} themselves, and the fat roll of hundred-dollar bills.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve, {{but there}} was no frost, or snow, or sparkle. It was a green Christmas, and the night was mild and dim, with hazy starlight. A little wind was {{laughing}} freakishly among the firs around Ingleside and rustling among the sere grasses along the garden walks. It was more like a night in early spring or late fall than in December; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve, and there was a light in every window of Ingleside, the glow breaking out through the whispering darkness like a flame-red blossom swung against the background of the evergreens; for the children were coming home for the Christmas reunion, as they always came--Fritz and Margaret and Laddie and Nora, and Robert's two boys in the place of Robert, who had died fourteen years ago--and the old house must put forth its best of light and good cheer to welcome them.|$|E
60|$|The tailor lay ill {{for three}} days and nights; and then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve, and very late at night.

Also there had been another wrangle among the men on the pit-bank that evening.|$|E

60|$|Next morning, thank Heaven, {{admitted}} me to {{my right}} mind again. I {{got out of bed}} and peered through the window. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> Day.
