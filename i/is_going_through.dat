A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E

5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to the bypass <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues.
