Users create visual presentations, which they, or others, can dynamically explore to search for patterns in their data. The JavaScreen is a Java applet we have recently developed, which functions as a <b>DEVise</b> client.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Macquarie University, Division of Society, Culture, Media and Philosophy, Department of Critical and Cultural Studies, 2007. Bibliography: leaves 241 - 251. Introduction [...] Re-devising theatre: {{towards a}} {{genealogy}} of <b>devising</b> practice [...] Pre-devising: group formation, development and games [...] <b>Devising</b> theatre: This {{is not an}} exit [...] Conclusion. This non-traditional thesis explores the practical and theoretical processes of group-devised theatre. The research informing this thesis is derived from two interrelated components - a practical project in group <b>devising,</b> and a theoretical study of alternative theatre, <b>devising</b> methodologies, and performance theory. [...] Chapter One defines "devising" before tracing its origins {{through the development of}} experimental practices from the historical avant-garde to the present day. These practices include radical disruptions to discursive language and structure, increased multimedia, reconsiderations of the performer's function and the use of improvisation. This genealogy is argued to be a "literature of practice" capable of informing contemporary <b>devising</b> projects, as well as helping to establish the position of <b>devising</b> within contemporary performance theory. [...] Chapter Two examines how creative collaborators begin to form and function as a <b>devising</b> group, a period I theoretically term "pre-devising". By examining the experiences of my group, gaps in <b>devising</b> literature concerning group formation and composition are identified, complemented by an investigation into the role of theatre games in building ensemble. [...] Chapter Three draws upon the genealogy of <b>devising,</b> <b>devising</b> literature and performance theory to interrogate the process of <b>devising</b> our production, This Is Not An Exit. The theoretical and practical problems of our methods are explored. These methods include organising the group as an artistic democracy, developing naturalistic characters, and establishing a "postmodern aesthetic". By analysing our experiences, this chapter attempts to illustrate the complex tangle of influences informing contemporary performance practitioners, and highlight areas ripe for future critical research.
