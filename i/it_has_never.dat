5|$|The low ratings doomed {{the show}} to a single season and, {{although}} admired, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> developed a significant following among science fiction aficionados. Boucher has stated that, in retrospect, he feels that the series was too outlandish for crime drama fans and not outlandish enough for science fiction fans and that ultimately it appealed to neither.|$|E

50|$|The {{rights of}} {{performers}} last for 50 {{years from the}} distribution or communication of the performance, or for 50 years from the performance itself if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been communicated to the public during this period. The rights of phonogram producers last for 50 years after publication of the phonogram, or for 50 years after its communication to the public if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been published during that period, or for 50 years after its creation if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been communicated to the public. The rights of film producers last for 50 years after the communication of the film to the public, or for 50 years after its creation if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been communicated to the public during that period. The rights of broadcasting organisations last for 50 {{years after the first}} transmission of a broadcast. The European Commission proposed this be extended to 95 years and following this suggestion the European Parliament passed legislation to increase the term to 70 years.|$|R

5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz {{is based}} on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is the only novel {{published}} by the author during his lifetime. (His follow-up work, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997.) Considered one of the classics of science fiction, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been out of print and has seen over 25 reprints and editions. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been recorded again {{and it is}} now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on Mar√≠a Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E

5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Albany, the ship {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery was at this time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet noticed that the young Montgomery was not with the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|From 1997, the 166th Aviation Brigade {{has trained}} other {{aviation}} units for front-line service. As such, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen combat, and has thus never earned any campaign streamers or unit awards. As the only brigade in the First Army responsible for training aviation units, the 166th Aviation Brigade {{is the principal}} unit for training Army Reserve and Army National Guard assets preparing to deploy to contingencies around the world, which means it is responsible for 47 percent of all Army Aviation assets.|$|E

5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been used.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> {{been fully}} {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have}} been acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been {{played at the}} Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources. Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E

5|$|On September 24, 2004, Capcom debuted Haunting Ground {{under its}} Japanese name Demento at the Tokyo Game Show after {{launching}} a teaser page on their official website two days prior. The game {{was released in}} Japan on April 21, 2005, and later in PAL territories on April 29, and in North America on May 10. Critics described the game as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been officially declared as such.|$|E

The carpet python was reported as {{present on the}} island in very low numbers before 1960, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been observed there by naturalists, and is now absent.|$|E
5|$|The American pilot {{has been}} heavily bootlegged, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been {{broadcast}} on TV in any country. Excerpts {{from the first}} pilot are included in Dwarfing USA, a featurette on {{the making of the}} pilots included on the DVD release of Red Dwarf's fifth series.

5|$|The Nemegt Formation was {{deposited}} {{within the}} Late Cretaceous, although its exact age is unknown as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been dated radiometrically. According to different authors, the formation is late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, early Maastrichtian, or middle Maastrichtian in age. The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited {{in a plain}} crossed by rivers. The climate was warm and subhumid with seasonal droughts, and the soils were relatively dry. Nevertheless, the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying (and thus older) Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations, which show a semiarid climate.|$|E
5|$|The Rwanda women's {{national}} football team represents Rwanda in women's association football and {{is controlled by}} the F√©d√©ration Rwandaise de Football Association. It had to date been scheduled to compete in one major tournament, the inaugural Women's Challenge Cup held in Zanzibar in October 2007, but the event was ultimately canceled. It has finally debuted in February 2014 against Kenya. Like their male counterpart, the team is nicknamed The She-Amavubi (Kinyarwanda for The She-Wasps). <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> qualified for an African Championship finals or a World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 {{and then quickly}} withdrawn because of its poor performance at the box office. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, earning less than $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time.|$|E
