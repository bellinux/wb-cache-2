Between 31 October and 15 December 2003, the phenology of both R. conicus and U. solstitialis was studied at a dryland site in Canterbury. Adult R. conicus were more numerous than U. solstitialis on capitula throughout the experiment. Larvae of R. conicus were fi rst found on 11 November (15 % of capitula infested) and peaked on 2 December with 53 % of capitula infested. Only 3 % of capitula were infested by U. solstitialis. Adult R. conicus or U. solstitialis emerged from 79 % {{of the selected}} primary and secondary capitula. The majority of infested capitula (81 %) contained only R. conicus, 2 % contained only U. solstitialis while 17 % contained both insect species. Parasitism of R. conicus by the braconid parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides was low and occurred when most weevil eggs had been laid...|$|E

Ecological speciation occurs when divergent selection in different habitats creates strong selection for reproductive isolation which counteracts the homogenizing effects of gene flow between populations using those different habitats. Multiple divergent selection pressures can affect isolation {{and the strength}} of these selection pressures can vary geographically. Sympatric pairs of populations using different habitats in separate geographic areas may experience varying degrees of diversifying selection. Differing degrees of reproduction isolation between the populations result in what may be called a “Geographic Mosaic of Speciation”. A Geographic Mosaic of Speciation provides an opportunity to study the process of speciation in various degrees of completion. Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a fly that induces galls on tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima; Compositae) in North America with populations in the forest and prairie biomes of Minnesota, which are under divergent ecologically-based selection pressures. Previous research indicates that the goldenrod, the <b>gallfly,</b> and the natural enemies of the <b>gallfly</b> in the prairie and the forest biomes are genetically differentiated. I measured characteristics of each member of this three-trophic-level interaction across the prairie-forest biome border in order to characterize divergent selection on members of this interaction. I found that differences in the host plants, flies, and their natural enemies were distributed in a geographic mosaic at the prairie-forest biome border. Some neighboring populations were highly differentiated in a range of characteristics while others showed less differentiation. I then tested two pairs of neighboring fly populations to measure their degree of reproductive isolation and their adaptation to host-plants. The goldenrods from these paired sites were morphologically differentiated from each other. Flies from three out of the four sites tested had higher survival on plants from their own site than plants from the neighboring site, which shows that differences in plant morphology are correlated with differential selection of host-plants on E. solidaginis flies. Reproductive isolating mechanisms of the flies across the boundary are also distributed in a geographic mosaic which supports our hypothesis that these flies show a Geographic Mosaic of Speciation...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the fauna, biology, geographical spreading of the <b>gallflies</b> of the Ararat plain and its foothills. For the first time, the fauna of the <b>gallflies</b> in Armenia has been investigated. From the 92 species of the <b>gallflies,</b> 69 turned {{to be the new}} ones for the republic fauna, 65 species are new for the Transcaucasus fauna, and 62 species are new for the Front Asia. Described have been 2 kins and 2 species new for the science, and performed has been a zoogeographycal analysis of the Transcaucasian <b>gallflies</b> fauna. For the first time, the species of the gallflies-phytophages, the vermins of the valuable agriicultural plants (Dasineura mali, Dasineura trifolii, Asphondylia pruniperda) have been revealed as well as the species which can be used in the biological struggle against the weed vegetation (Zeuxidiplosis giardi, Dasineura hyperical) Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|Gall wasps, {{also called}} <b>gallflies,</b> are a family (Cynipidae) {{of the order}} Hymenoptera and are {{classified}} with the Apocrita suborder of wasps in the superfamily Cynipoidea. Their common name comes from the galls they induce on plants for larval development. About 1300 species of this generally very small creature (1-8 mm) are known worldwide, with about 360 species of 36 different genera in Europe and some 800 species in North America.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the genus Ormyrus (Chalcidoidea, Ormyridae) was conducted based on the morphology and biology of the terminal-instar larvae of ten west European species that are parasitoids of gall wasps and <b>gallflies</b> of the families Cynipidae, Eurytomidae and Tephritidae. The first detailed descriptions are provided of the terminal-instar larvae of these ten species using SEM images to illustrate diagnostic characters with systematic values. A key is provided for the identification of ormyrid larvae associated with galls in Europe, which is based particularly on characters of the head, mouthparts and mandibles. Although only limited informative variation in body shape was found, the setation of the head provided several characters of potential taxonomic value. The larval biology of the ten ormyrid species inhabiting different galls is also summarised. Although Ormyrus larvae are usually solitary idiobiont ectoparasitoids of the host larva of various gall-inhabiting insects, evidence of secondary phytophagy was observed in some species.

40|$|The National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) has {{declared}} war on the Chromolaena weed (Chromolaena odorata) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), and has won the first battle. Chromolaena {{is one of the}} most serious invasive weeds in the tropics. As well as having a highly damaging effect on agriculture, the weed is also a major threat to biodiversity. Chromolaena has been spreading since it was first sighted in the Gazelle Peninsula in East New Britain in the 1960 s and is currently confirmed in 12 provinces of PNG. Now NARI, which has been conducting research into the biological control of this weed since 1999, has found two natural enemies of the alien species. Two insects have been released for biological control, the moth Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata and the gall fly Cecidochares connexa. The larvae of the moth feed on Chromolaena leaves and, when there are sufficient quantities of them, they cause heavy defoliation, resulting in the destruction of the weed. Adults of the gall fly lay eggs in soft apical stem tissue and the larvae, upon hatching, feed in the stem, causing gall formation. The galls affect the flow of water and nutrients to other parts of the weed, thus stunting plant growth and reducing seed production. In the Markham Valley of Morobe Province, the combined effect of the moth and the gall fly has produced spectacular defoliation and the death of many plants in areas of previously impenetrable Chromolaena weed. NARI is rearing and releasing more moth larvae and <b>gallflies,</b> which can be supplied for release when new infestations of Chromolaena weed are detected.
