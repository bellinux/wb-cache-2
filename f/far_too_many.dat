5000|$|The {{coronation}} attracted considerable {{criticism from}} {{opponents of the}} Whig government of both Tory and Radical views. The Tory objections, mostly made beforehand, were that the government's plans to put much of the spending into the long public procession detracted from the traditional dignity of the ceremonies at Westminster, which would be [...] "shorn of majesty by Benthamite utilitarianism". The Radical left, including the Chartist movement, thought the whole occasion <b>far</b> <b>too</b> expensive; <b>many</b> opposed {{the continuation of the}} monarchy completely. For different reasons, both Tories and Radicals objected to the government's effort to turn the day into a popular celebration, seen by as wide a public as possible.|$|R

25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{response is}} called universal composition (UC). UC says that {{so long as}} the Xs do not spatially overlap, the Xs can compose a complex object. Universal compositionalists are also considered those who support unrestricted composition. More formally: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is a Y such that Y is composed of the Xs. For example, someone's left thumb, the top half of another person's right shoe, and a quark in the center of their galaxy can compose a complex object according to universal composition. Likewise, this theory also has some issues, most of them dealing with our experiences that these randomly chosen parts make up a complex whole and there are <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> objects posited in our ontology.|$|E
25|$|About {{the same}} time, Professor Alice Kober studied Linear B {{and managed to}} {{construct}} grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober noticed {{that a number of}} Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters {{in the middle of the}} words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since Linear B had <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> to record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E

He felt very old--centuries older than those careless, care- free young companions of his others days. He had travelled <b>far,</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> to go back. Their mode of life, which had once been his, was now distasteful to him. He was disappointed in it all. He had developed into an alien. As the steam beer had tasted raw, so their companionship seemed raw to him. He was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> removed. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> thousands of opened books yawned between them and him. He had exiled himself. He had travelled in the vast realm of intellect until {{he could no longer}} return home. On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need for companionship remained unsatisfied. He had found no new home. As the gang could not understand him, as his own family could not understand him, as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this girl beside him, whom he honored high, could not understand him nor the honor he paid her. His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought it over.|$|R

25|$|On 23 April 2009, Keane was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} manager of Ipswich Town on a two-year contract, {{the day after the}} club had dismissed Jim Magilton. His first game in charge came the following Saturday with a 3–0 away win over Cardiff City, the final league match to be played at Ninian Park. The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2–1 win over Coventry City. In the 2009–10 season, Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper Marton Fulop, midfielders Carlos Edwards and Grant Leadbitter and brought in Jack Colback, David Healy and Daryl Murphy on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first fourteen matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place. Many inconsistencies in the 2009–10 and the 2010–11 season meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions {{and as a result of}} a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship. Keane was dismissed as Ipswich manager on 7 January 2011.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} there was a {{movement}} to restrict immigration into the US, as it was widely believed that “morons” or feebleminded individuals were the cause of many societal problems and that border authorities were weakening the nation by allowing <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> of these individuals to enter the country. Ellis Island on New York Harbor was the hub for arrival when the immigration station there was rebuilt in 1900. At first, emigrants were lined up and inspected primarily for medical ailments, initially based on the individual’s overall appearance. More scrutizing inspections were conducted if an individual was flagged for some ailment. For the most part, until this time, any concern regarding mental disorders was limited to psychiatric illnesses. However, as Francis Galton’s ideas regarding eugenics. became more popular in the early 1900s, concerns for that feebleminded individuals were weakening society grew, and mental deficiency among emigrants also became a concern. Another important contributing factor was the development of intelligence tests during this time. Both Alfred Binet and his student Theodore Simon were leaders in this development. Henry Goddard, a prominent eugenicist of the time who had been using Binet and Simon’s scale to measure intelligence in adults, suggested that theses could be used to identify feebleminded or mentally deficient individuals at Ellis Island who posed a threat to the integrity of society. By 1910, the concerns for mentally defective people entering the United States had grown {{to such an extent that}} the officials at Ellis Island invited Henry Goddard to teach the physicians about intelligence testing. However, after spending an entire day there, Goddard had no recommendations for the physicians, as he was impressed by both the size of the problem as well as the physicians ability to detect defect given the number of individuals coming through the immigration station.|$|E
