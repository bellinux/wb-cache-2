5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of Ark 6 before <b>drifting</b> <b>off.</b> With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|While <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast}} of Florida, Alex {{produced}} rip currents and strong waves along the North Carolina coast resulting in nine lifeguard rescues from the surf. Upon moving by the Outer Banks, a storm surge of up to 6feet (1.8m) occurred on the Pamlico Sound side of Buxton and Ocracoke Village. The flooding on Ocracoke Island was the worst since Hurricane Gloria nineteen years earlier. Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, waters rose 24feet (0.61.2m) above normal. Rainfall directly along the coast amounted to over 5inches (127mm), while Ocracoke experienced 7.55inches (192mm). Maximum sustained winds peaked at 88mph (124km/h), and gusts peaked at 115mph (169km/h) in Morehead City. Beach erosion was minor along much of North Carolina's coastline, {{with the exception of}} Ocracoke Island where erosion was significant.|$|E
5|$|Morris and Burne-Jones {{then spent}} time {{with one of the}} Firm's patrons, the wealthy George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle and his wife Rosalind, at their Medieval home in Naworth Castle, Cumberland. In July 1874, the Morris family then took Burne-Jones' two {{children}} with them on their holiday to Bruges, Belgium. However, by this point Morris' friendship with Rossetti had seriously eroded, and in July 1874 their acrimonious falling out led Rossetti to leave Kelmscott, with Morris' publisher F.S. Ellis taking his place. With the company's other partners <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> to work on other projects, Morris decided to consolidate his own control of the Firm and become sole proprietor and manager. In March 1875, he paid Â£1000 each in compensation to Rossetti, Brown, and Marshall, although the other partners waived their claims to financial compensation. That month, the Firm was officially disbanded and replaced by Morris & Co, although Burne-Jones and Webb would continue to produce designs for it in future. This accomplished, he resigned his directorship of the Devon Great Consols, selling his remaining shares in the company.|$|E

500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} {{awarded the}} episode an 8.2 rating out of 10, noting that [...] "The Office {{is at its}} best when it has one foot planted in reality and the other <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> into the absurd." [...] She also enjoyed that the show illustrated Michael's actual talents as a salesman. Furthermore, Stiernberg felt that Andy's subplot helped balance the [...] "silliness" [...] of Michael's main plot. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and praised Olyphant's acting, writing that he [...] "just killed it" [...] during his appearance. He also called the entry [...] "a big step up from last week", largely due to its entertaining main plot and its [...] "pleasant" [...] B-story.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, {{fact and fiction}} became intertwined. As early as June 1883, the Los Angeles Times retold the Mary Celeste story with invented detail: [...] "Every sail was set, the tiller was lashed fast, not a rope was out of place... The fire was burning in the galley. The dinner was {{standing}} untasted and scarcely cold... the log [...] written up to the hour of her discovery." [...] Twenty years later, in the November 1906 Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Mary Celeste was recorded as <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> the Cape Verde Islands, some [...] south of the actual location. Among many inaccuracies, the first mate was [...] "a man named Briggs," [...] and there were live chickens on board.|$|E

In keeping with his Confucian values, Choe {{prepared}} to leave his post immediately and begin the period of mourning for the loss of his father. However, while setting sail for mainland Korea with a crew of 43 Koreans, Choe's ship was blown far off course during a violent storm that lasted 14days, his ship aimlessly <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> towards China until reaching the Chinese coast off of Taizhou, Zhejiang, near Ningbo.

500|$|Barlow {{had arrived}} in the United States in February 1997 for {{recording}} the track, where Clive Davis, who was managing his career in the United States, played him a [...] "poppier" [...] version of the song, remixed by Junior Vasquez. He also requested Barlow to perform [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] at the 1997 pre-Grammy Award party. However, the singer did not have any time to rehearse or memorize the lyrics, resulting in the performance receiving negative reviews from critics and audience alike. With The Times Barlow recounted the evening saying, [...] "I don't remember the words. I came in at all the wrong times. I can see people <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> to the toilet in droves. Talk about dying on your arse!" [...] The combination of the negative review towards his performance and contractual obligations led to Barlow release [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] as his second single on 24 April 1997 in the United Kingdom. The CD single consisted of the single version along with the Vasquez remix and two other tracks from Open Road, [...] "Meaning Of A Love Song" [...] and [...] "Always". Another song, [...] "Cuddly Toy", was released on the B-side of another CD single for the song, released in May 1997. [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] was also remixed by DJs Cuca and Monster Makers, and was released in a CD single in June 1997.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{grounded}} {{so that the}} waves pummeled the bow section. [...] At about 6am, the ship broke in two, with the stern grounded on the shore and the bow <b>drifting</b> <b>off.</b> [...] Many of the passengers and crew were swept away, but three people made it to shore (only 50 feet away) and another 11 remained in the bow section of the ship until the morning of November 8, when the storm abated. [...] The survivors all got to shore on November 8, and stayed that night with a party of fishermen. [...] On November 9, the Athabasca was intercepted and the survivors were taken on to Thunder Bay.|$|E
2500|$|American {{troops had}} overrun two smaller targets, and {{spotters}} described them as [...] "surrounded by dead Germans".

Texas could not connect with her shore party and so stayed {{in line with the}} minesweepers. Arkansass salvos did no damage, so as Group 2 steamed into the battery's arc of fire, the German guns were able to fire. The minesweepers were all bracketed. The destroyer Barton was holed with a ricochet dud from another battery that landed in her aft diesel room. She returned fire on the disclosed battery without air or shore spotting. All minesweepers were splashed with near misses. The destroyer Laffey took a dud in her port bow by the anchor. The damage control party pried it loose and tossed it overboard.|$|E

She was in the main grip of the current; the canoe was too large; the paddle was too inadequate; and too much of her time and strength was wasted in bailing. Besides, she was very weak and growing weaker. Despite her efforts, the canoe was <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> to the westward.|$|E
60|$|And {{as if in}} a spell, Gudrun {{was aware}} of his body, {{stretching}} and surging like the marsh-fire, stretching towards her, his hand coming straight forward like a stem.

He looked round at the boat. It was <b>drifting</b> <b>off</b> a little. He lifted the oar to bring it back. And the exquisite pleasure of slowly arresting the boat, in the heavy-soft water, was complete as a swoon.|$|E
