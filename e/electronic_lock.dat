500|$|The {{player can}} upgrade their skills by using [...] "cyber-modules" [...] given as rewards for {{completing}} objectives such as searching {{the ship and}} then spend them at devices called [...] "cyber-upgrade units" [...] to obtain enhanced skills. Operating system (O/S) units allow one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement). An in-game currency called [...] "nanites" [...] may be spent on items at vending machines, including ammunition supplies and health packs. [...] "Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines" [...] can be activated and reconstitute the player for 10 nanites if they die inside {{the area in which}} the machine resides. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a save point. The player can hack devices, such as keypads to open alternate areas and vending machines to reduce prices. When a hack is attempted, a minigame begins that features a grid of green nodes; the player must connect three in a straight row to succeed. Optionally, <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> picks, called [...] "ICE-picks", can be found that will automatically hack a machine, regardless of its difficulty.|$|E

50|$|Time <b>locks,</b> {{combination}} <b>locks,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>locks,</b> electromagnetic locks, {{and locks}} using rotating disks, such as disc tumbler locks, are inherently invulnerable to this attack, since their mechanism {{does not contain}} springs. However, some <b>electronic</b> <b>locks</b> feature a key backup that is susceptible to bumping. Warded locks are not vulnerable to bumping, but they are vulnerable to a similar attack called a skeleton key, {{which is also a}} filed-down key.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>locks</b> {{as well as}} {{mechanical}} locks {{are available}} on many models of safes. The highest reliability exists for mechanical locks, although they are often more time consuming to open than <b>electronic</b> <b>locks.</b> [...] Some mechanical combination locks have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations {{in the hopes of}} unlocking the safe.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> {{works by}} means of an {{electric}} current and is usually connected to an access control system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the bolt or cylinder to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{doors are}} rear-hinged, a style {{commonly}} referred to as suicide doors, but called 'coach doors' by Rolls-Royce. Because of the rear-seating position in relation to the rear inner-door handles, buttons are mounted on both C-pillars which operate hydraulic motors in order to close the rear doors. An <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> prevents the doors from being accidentally opened when moving.|$|E
50|$|A {{keyless entry}} system is an <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> that {{controls}} access to a building or vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key. The term {{keyless entry system}} originally meant a lock controlled by a keypad located {{at or near the}} driver's door, which required entering a predetermined (or self-programmed) numeric code. Such systems now have a hidden touch-activated keypad and are still available on certain Ford and Lincoln models.|$|E

Residence halls operate on <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> systems requiring card access 24 hours a day or are staffed 24 hours a day by security guards. Security cameras in residence halls, parking lots, and in other locations act {{as a deterrent to}} criminal behavior and serve as an investigative tool. Commissioned police officers supported by other trained personnel patrol regularly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the bonus}} round, the couple {{tried to open}} a set of [...] "Golden Doors" [...] by {{programming}} the correct combination into the <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> that kept the doors closed. The lock consisted three rows of four numbers each, and {{only one of the}} numbers {{in each of the three}} rows was part of the combination. To narrow the odds, the couple attempted to remove the incorrect numbers from the lock.|$|E
50|$|A readout of {{activity}} that {{took place on the}} hotel room's electronic door lock indicated that an attempt was made to reprogram al-Mabhouh’s electronic door lock at this time. The investigators believe that the <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> on al-Mabhouh’s door may have been reprogrammed and that the killers gained entry to his room this way. The locks in question, VingCard Locklink brand (Dubai police video, 21:42), can be accessed and reprogrammed directly at the hotel room door.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> {{combination}} <b>locks,</b> while generally {{safe from}} the attacks on their mechanical counterparts, suffer from their own set of flaws. If the arrangement of numbers is fixed, {{it is easy to}} determine the lock sequence by viewing several successful accesses. Similarly, the numbers in the combination (but not the actual sequence) may be determined by which keys show signs of recent use. More advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>locks</b> may scramble the numbers' locations randomly to prevent these attacks.|$|R
50|$|As {{biometrics}} {{become more}} and more prominent as a recognized means of positive identification, their use in security systems increases. Some <b>electronic</b> <b>locks</b> take advantage of technologies such as fingerprint scanning, retinal scanning, iris scanning and voice print identification to authenticate users.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 2006, VISIONLINE is {{wireless}} locking technology {{developed by}} VingCard Elsafe.

A gimballed hemisphere referred to as both a 'seismic detector' and a 'TARDIS perceptor' appears, and in the episode [...] "The Planet of Decision" [...] an 'electro unit' is employed to disable an <b>electronic</b> <b>lock.</b> The prop consisted of a large revolving parabolic dish from the centre of which two converging rods protruded.|$|E
50|$|The basic Central Control Unit (CCU) {{starts off}} as an 8 {{extension}} unit, with either analog POTS lines or ISDN line modules available. There is a serial connection {{that can be}} used for call logging and configuration. It can either use standard telephones or proprietary feature phones. A special Door Phone may be added on extension 23 and the system may be connected to an <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> relay to allow the door to be opened via a Door Phone call. Any extension may be programmed as a PA (Public Address) speaker.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>lock</b> (or {{electric}} lock) is a {{locking device}} which operates {{by means of}} electric current. Electric locks are sometimes stand-alone with an electronic control assembly mounted directly to the lock. Electric locks may be connected to an access control system, the advantages of which include: key control, where keys can be added and removed without re-keying the lock cylinder; fine access control, where time and place are factors; and transaction logging, where activity is recorded. Electronic locks can also be remotely monitored and controlled, both to lock and unlock.|$|E
