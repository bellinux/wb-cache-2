25|$|Edward William 'Ted' Pooley (13 February 1842 – 18 July 1907) was an English cricketer. Ted Pooley's {{greatest}} {{claim to}} fame is {{that he should have}} been England's first Test match wicket-keeper. The story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> but it overshadows the fact that he played cricket for Surrey and Middlesex between 1861 and 1883, and was held in the highest regard for his cricketing ability if not for his personal behaviour.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone, commented that the video takes place [...] "in a dingy club" [...] however, [...] "the real attraction here are the grainy visuals filmed in fake fuzziness, giving the clip a retro feel." [...] Chris Martins of Spin believes that [...] "The vintage may be slightly off since the Unorthodox Jukebox single sounds far more Sting than Curtis Mayfield", however praised the video [...] "the look <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> nonetheless." ...|$|E

500|$|Brynner {{insisted on}} renovations to the Uris {{before he would}} play there, stating that the theatre resembled [...] "a public toilet". He also insisted that {{dressing}} rooms on the tour and at the Uris be arranged to his satisfaction. [...] According to his biographer Michelangelo Capua, for years afterwards, performers thanked Brynner for having backstage facilities across the country cleaned up. [...] New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes said of the revival, [...] "The cast <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> [...] Mr. Brynner grinning fire and snorting charm is as near to the original as makes little difference" [...] and called Towers [...] "piquantly ladylike and sweet without being dangerously saccharine". However, fellow Times critic Mel Gussow warned, later in the run, that [...] "to a certain extent [...] was coasting on his charisma".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the music}} press, with Billboard magazine predicting that [...] "the Byrds will be riding high on the LP charts again with this top rock package." [...] Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious, noting that [...] "the album <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> {{but it would be}} sad if it served as a monument, marking the end of the Byrds' development. There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity." [...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal {{about what is going on}} around us." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle [...] {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as early as 1886, {{it was not until}} 1901 Potter began elaborating it while on holiday at Lingholm west of Derwentwater where she met young Kathleen and Lucie Carr, daughters of the local vicar. In 1902, it was put to paper. The Carr family lived at Skelghyl, but Potter took some artistic liberty and moved the house's location to Little Town in the text. The family came to tea at Lingholm often with Potter delighted by the one-year-child's behaviour. On one occasion, Lucie left her gloves behind at Lingholm, and Potter transformed the incident into the fictional Lucie's propensity for losing her pocket handkerchiefs. A small copy book contains what {{is believed to be the}} earliest manuscript of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Its title page is inscribed: [...] "Made at Lingholm, Sept. 01 told to cousin Stephanie at Melford Nov. 01—written down Nov. 02. There are no pictures, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> to tell—" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced through the agency of supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night and Sleep in Act II, which is apt as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not what they seem. The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons tell us that the marriage here celebrated <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting {{on later}} novels in the series, Lester del Rey in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact wrote of The Hostage of Zir that [...] "here's {{only one way}} to {{describe}} it's a new Krishna novel. And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. You could call it sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and human science is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed." [...] He concludes that [...] "f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> to start with." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{compiled}} 68 poems {{as well as}} a [...] "novellette in verse" [...] titled Guy Vernon. The {{book was}} published by Roberts Brothers as part of their [...] "No Name" [...] series and included both American and British poets. The series was meant to allow readers to enjoy literature based on inherent merit without the burden of knowing the author's popularity, as the New York Graphic reported, readers were [...] "forced to trust more to their own taste and judgment, and rely less on reputations". Harper's also wrote approvingly of the series: [...] "The idea <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> not only because it will pique the curiosity of the reader, but also because it will put the writers on their mettle to do their best, and absolutely prevent that trading on reputation which is the greatest vice of American litterateurs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sarah Grant of Consequence of Sound {{stated that}} [...] "there is plenty to enjoy as you push and shove right to {{end of the}} album", and noted that [...] "Push proves that country is another {{possibility}} for the band that's never cowered from a genre risk". Theon Weber of Spin concluded, [...] "This isn't a great album, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> in a year quietly blessed with a small crop of good records (Metric, Gossip) with dreamy synths and girls up front. It's also—in its confidence, its playfulness, and the slightly stoned degree {{to which it is}} relaxed—No Doubt's most accomplished party." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote, [...] "By and large, the more interesting tracks are stacked on the front end of Push and Shove, and the songs on {{the second half of the}} album are comparably safer, blurring together upon first listen." [...] Ryan Reed of Paste claimed that [...] "No Doubt has always been more than a platform for a gifted frontwoman, a fact Push and Shove seems to forget at times, downplaying the band's fluid chemistry in favor of soaring hooks and 'cranked to 11' dynamics", adding that the album is [...] "still a welcome return, even if it's a tad exhausting." ...|$|E
