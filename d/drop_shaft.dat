As a result of this work, the capacity of the sewers was greatly increased, and 26 storm sewage overflows were closed, resulting in significant improvement to water quality in the river.|$|E

Preliminary experiments investigated various types of dissipation chambers, aiming to characterize the energy dissipation mechanism of the outlet structure.

The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) desires to develop new, updated and enhanced computer models to allow for simulation of the TARP systems. The new models will be used to optimize operation of the system as actually constructed, to determine constraints in the system, identify physical changes that may be needed to improve performance, and allow what-if analyses to be performed for potential storm scenarios and facility revisions. The modeling includes development of a Physical Inventory system, Hydraulic Modeling of the TARP systems, and Hydrologic Modeling of the TARP service areas. The Physical Inventory provides a digital description of the physical geometry of the TARP system and the related hydraulic performance of system components. Hydrologic Modeling uses data for each dropshafts service area to determine hydrographs describing the inflows to the TARP systems. A ma jor component of the Hydrologic Modeling is to develop tools and methods that allow robust simulation of the extreme heterogeneity of highly urbanized systems and that provide guidance for data compilation needed to improve the accuracy of such simulations. Hydraulic Modeling uses the information from the Physical Inventory and the Hydrologic Modeling to simulate hydraulic response of the TARP system to different inputs.
