5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that the flies intentionally {{seek out the}} <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> for its intoxicating properties.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> {{has been}} mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric.</b> Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} iconic {{toadstool}} species, the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> {{is a large}} white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, {{and is one of}} the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture.|$|E

5|$|The red-and-white spotted {{toadstool}} is {{a common}} image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show <b>fly</b> <b>agarics</b> used as seats, or homes. <b>Fly</b> <b>agarics</b> have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two {{of the most famous}} uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms in several stages), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.|$|R
25|$|Within {{the main}} body of {{mushrooms}}, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, <b>fly</b> <b>agarics</b> and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of Psilocybe, paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc.|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis, {{commonly}} known as the royal <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family. Common in Scandinavian countries, it is also found in eastern and northern Europe. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska. The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> (Amanita muscaria), and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species. A.regalis differs from it in being larger, with a liver-brown cap bearing numerous scabs, and in having a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains muscimol, the same psychoactive compound found in A.muscaria.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University {{rejected}} Wasson's {{theory and}} noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma. In his 1976 survey, Hallucinogens and Culture, anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against {{the identification of the}} <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. <b>Fly</b> <b>agaric</b> mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>agarics</b> {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|R
5|$|The Finnish {{historian}} T. I. Itkonen {{mentions that}} A.muscaria was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume <b>fly</b> <b>agarics</b> with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken {{published an article}} in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it {{was known as the}} miskwedo. This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of Amanita muscaria.|$|R
500|$|Philologist, archeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro {{postulated}} that early Christian theology {{was derived from}} a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of A. muscaria in his 1970 book The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was roundly discredited by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University, and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth; he notes that neither <b>fly</b> <b>agarics</b> nor their host trees {{are found in the}} Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been [...] "the best kept secret in the world" [...] as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.|$|R
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric.</b> It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Professor Marija Gimbutas, {{a renowned}} Lithuanian historian, {{reported}} to R. Gordon Wasson {{on the use}} of this mushroom in Lithuania. In remote areas of Lithuania Amanita muscaria has been consumed at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. The professor also reported that the Lithuanians used to export A.muscaria to the Lapps in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> for religious use in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} eat a {{range of}} foods, such as tree bark, tree buds, berries, many types of seeds and acorns, walnuts, and other nuts, and some types of fungi found in the forests, including <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> mushrooms (Amanita muscaria). They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft cambial tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) suffer the greatest damage.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including <b>fly</b> <b>agaric,</b> stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E
500|$|The {{species has}} been called by several vernacular names, {{including}} the [...] "Brown fly agaric", the [...] "king of Sweden Amanita", or the king <b>fly</b> <b>agaric.</b> In France it is known as Amanite royale, while in Germany it is Königsfliegenpilz. The specific epithet {{is derived from the}} Latin word regalis, meaning [...] "royal". In 2000, it was selected by the German Mycological Society as [...] "Mushroom of the Year".|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric.</b> The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose sclerotia appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with ergot, which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid.|$|E
500|$|An {{account of}} the {{journeys}} of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions {{of the use of}} the mukhomor there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, Citizen of the World. The mushroom had been identified as the <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> by this time. Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books The Seven Sisters of Sleep and A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi. This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A hallucinogenic [...] "scarlet toadstool" [...] from Lappland is featured as a plot element in Charles Kingsley's 1866 novel Hereward the Wake based on the medieval figure of the same name. Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow describes the fungus as a [...] "relative of the poisonous Destroying Angel" [...] and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested Amanita muscaria. <b>Fly</b> <b>agaric</b> shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner.|$|E
500|$|Chalciporus piperatus {{grows in}} conifer {{plantations}} {{associated with the}} <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> (Amanita muscaria) and the chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius). It has been recorded under introduced loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in Santa Catarina and Paraná states in southern Brazil, and under introduced trees in the Los Lagos Region of Chile. It has also spread into native forest in northeastern Tasmania and Victoria, having been found growing with the native myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The rare variety hypochryseus occurs only in Europe, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Also rare, variety amarellus is widespread in European coniferous forests, where it usually found near pines, spruce, and sometimes fir.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} Vikings used A.muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first {{suggested}} by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports {{about the use of}} <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be [...] "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".|$|E
500|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>agaric</b> fruiting bodies {{emerge from}} the soil looking like white eggs. After {{emerging}} from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil; this is helpful in identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from [...] to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens. Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around [...] in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

2500|$|Ethnobotanical and ethnomycological {{scholars}} such as R. Gordon Wasson, Carl Ruck and Clark Heinrich {{write that}} the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the entheogenic Amanita muscaria (or <b>fly</b> <b>agaric)</b> mushroom. [...] Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms. At times artists would co-opt the apple, {{as well as other}} religious symbology, whether for ironic effect or as a stock element of symbolic vocabulary. Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as symbol of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with Venus who is shown holding it.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{repelling}} and/or killing bed bugs {{include the use}} of plants, fungi, and insects (or their extracts), such as black pepper; black cohosh (Actaea racemosa); Pseudarthria hookeri; Laggera alata (Chinese yángmáo cǎo | 羊毛草); Eucalyptus saligna oil; henna (Lawsonia inermis or camphire); [...] "infused oil of Melolontha vulgaris" [...] (presumably [...] cockchafer); <b>fly</b> <b>agaric</b> (Amanita muscaria); Actaea spp. (e.g. black cohosh); tobacco; [...] "heated oil of Terebinthina" [...] (i.e. true turpentine); wild mint (Mentha arvensis); narrow-leaved pepperwort (Lepidium ruderale); Myrica spp. (e.g. bayberry); Robert geranium (Geranium robertianum); bugbane (Cimicifuga spp.); [...] "herb and seeds of Cannabis"; [...] "opulus" [...] berries (possibly maple or European cranberrybush); masked hunter bugs (Reduvius personatus), [...] "and many others".|$|E
2500|$|Plants often {{serve as}} {{images of the}} axis mundi. The image of the Cosmic Tree {{provides}} an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots). In some Pacific island cultures the banyan tree, of which the Bodhi tree is of the Sacred Fig variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ashwath vriksha ("I am banyan tree among trees" [...] - Bhagavad Gita). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches. [...] The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha, sat on the night he attained enlightenment. The Yggdrasil, or World Ash, functions {{in much the same}} way in Norse mythology; it is the site where Odin found enlightenment. Other examples include Jievaras in Lithuanian mythology and Thor's Oak in the myths of the pre-Christian Germanic peoples. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the Paradise garden from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. Bamboo, the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The Christmas tree, which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian European beliefs, represents an axis mundi. , such as the <b>Fly</b> <b>Agaric</b> mushroom among the Evenks of Russia. In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree (...) [...] Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the Huainanzi. The Mesoamerican world tree connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.|$|E
