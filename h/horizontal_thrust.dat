5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} a bowstring arch, this type of arch bridge {{incorporates}} a tie between two {{opposite ends of the}} arch.

This first area is represented by part of northern flanks of various anticlines; the second is formed by anticlines a little more inclined to the south, a third by folds and <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> in the extreme east.|$|R
25|$|Roman domes {{are found}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi are common features. They are customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. To buttress the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A static {{analysis}} of quadruped biomechanics, combined with observations of longitudinal postural movement, has revealed important functional {{attributes of the}} postural control system. Since posture is an outward expression of central nervous system (CNS) behavior, these results may contribute {{to an understanding of}} integrative functions of the CNS. Beginning from a simple biomechanical model of the dog, the properties of the legs are examined to show how the end-reaction forces on a given foot can be controlled by the muscles in the corresponding leg. During quiet standing, the distribution of effort among the muscles can be modified by small body movements or by pushing horizontally with equal force at the anterior and posterior feet. A measured "bias force" of about 1 / 2 kg per foot indicates that the dog attempts to spread his feet longitudinally and thereby achieves a comfortable distribution of the effort required to stand. When the legs are used for <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusting</b> the muscle tensions must be adjusted so that a coordinated movement will result. Certain problems of mechanical stability are reduced to a simple mathematical condition and a method is given to determine effective muscle action for producing <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> without losing stability. Postural reactions of several trained dogs have been observed during and following abrupt longitudinal displacements of the supporting surface. The initial force response, which appeared to arise from sensory stimuli in each foot, was pulsatile and occurred before voluntary action could have developed. The "reflex like" character of this response lends support to current theory regarding "program" responses in motor control processes. The functional properties of the anterior and posterior limbs are separately examined in terms of the anatomical structure. The anterior limbs are clearly very stable and well suited for supporting weight whereas the less stable posterior limbs are highly agile and adapted for <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusting...</b>|$|R
25|$|Masonry saucer domes, {{because they}} exist entirely in compression, {{can be built}} much thinner than other dome shapes without {{becoming}} unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they are more vulnerable to damage from movement in their supports.|$|E
25|$|An {{arch bridge}} is a bridge with {{abutments}} {{at each end}} shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges work by transferring {{the weight of the}} bridge and its loads partially into a <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> restrained by the abutments at either side.

25|$|Romanesque bridges present large arches whose height {{had to be}} {{balanced}} {{with the use of}} abutments at each end by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> restrained by the abutments at either side. Bridge builders also improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of the dome of Santa María del Fiore involved solving the following two problems: first of all, {{to find a solution}} in which the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> did not exceed the capacity of the thin edge of the dome constructed. Secondly, the construction had to be carried out without centrings. &# 13; Brunelleschi found an answer to both problems. He combined vertical Gothic style arches with horizontal ones, thus creating a veritable network of arches. The experience of the Middle Ages had made it clear to him that ogival arches transmit less <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> than do half arches. He found the solution for the construction without centrings by studying Roman domes and in particular the Pantheon. La construcción de la Cúpula de Santa María del Flore suponía resolver los dos problemas siguientes: Por un lado, encontrar una solución en que los empujes horizontales no superaran la capacidad del esbelto cimborrio construido. Por otro, la construcción debía hacerse sin cimbra. &# 13; Brunelleschi encontró respuesta para ambos problemas. Combinó arcos verticales al estilo gótico con otros horizontales, constituyendo un auténtico entramado espacial. La experiencia medieval le había puesto de manifiesto que el arco ojival transmite menores empujes horizontales que los de medio punto. La solución de la construcción sin cimbra la encontró reflexionando sobre las cúpulas romanas y, en particular, sobre el Panteón...|$|R
25|$|A masonry dome {{produces}} thrusts {{down and}} outward. They are thought of {{in terms of}} two kinds of forces at right angles from one another. Meridional forces (like the meridians, or lines of longitude, on a globe) are compressive only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of latitude on a globe) are in compression {{at the top and}} tension at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top. The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials. Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> at their haunches.|$|R

25|$|Many modern bridges, made {{of steel}} or {{reinforced}} concrete, often bear some of their load by tension within their structure. This reduces or eliminates the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> against the abutments and allows their construction on weaker ground. Structurally and analytically they are not true arches but rather a beam with {{the shape of an}} arch. See truss arch bridge for more on this type.|$|E
25|$|The {{cast iron}} arch ribs are 3ft 6in deep at the crown, {{increasing}} to 3ft 9in at the springing, with 12 inch flanges; the flanges and webs were three inches thick; {{in the case}} of the inner ribs, and two inches for the outer ribs. The rise was 17ft 6in, determined by the desired geometry to confine the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust</b> within bounds. Each arch was cast in five sections, bolted together.|$|E
25|$|The outward thrusts in {{the lower}} portion of a {{hemispherical}} masonry dome can be counteracted {{with the use of}} chains incorporated around the circumference or with external buttressing, although cracking along the meridians is natural. For small or tall domes with less <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrust,</b> the thickness of the supporting arches or walls can be enough to resist deformation, which is why drums tend to be much thicker than the domes they support.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{analyses}} performed via {{the distinct}} element method (DEM), employing rigid blocks and compliant joints, with results using finite-difference software (FLAC) obtained previously by other researchers. The paper then examines {{the capability of}} the rigid-block DEM at modelling joints realistically, with emphasis on the moment transfer between blocks. The line of thrust from this analysis was found to fit well with the well-established uniform catenary curve and the parabola, which has been used extensively in the rock engineering literature. This is an important verification exercise that is still lacking in the literature, especially for the rigid-block DEM. Finally, a comparison is made between the DEM and experimental work carried out previously by other researchers. The previously reported laboratory data were reinterpreted to derive more accurate contact laws in both normal and shear directions. A strain hardening or continuously yielding model was adopted in the latter. The calibration approach is demonstrated. The numerical findings suggest that improved predictions of beam deflections can be obtained and the predicted <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> are comparable to the results obtained by FLAC. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} are the metallic tie-rods, being relevant structural elements in historic masonry buildings. They actually contribute to guarantee an efficient connection between walls playing a decisive role in the control of <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> (both permanent, {{as in the case}} of arches and vaults, or environmental, {{as in the case of}} seismic actions). The idea of focusing the research on tie-rods derives from the evidence that, despite their role, scarce studies have been conducted on these structural elements. This results in a lack of knowledge on their technological features, in a scarcity of data on their mechanical properties and, finally, in many unaware replacement interventions. For these reasons, the research aims at: defining a simple non-destructive or micro-invasive assessment procedure of tie-rods, providing a more rational evaluation of their macroscopic parameters as well as their damage and degradation processes. The project will lead to: an improvement of the structural models of heritage buildings, resulting in more reliable seismic analyses and, indeed, in optimized strengthening interventions; a reduction of the number of replacements, resulting in a higher conservation of tangible assets (the tie-rods) and intangible values (e. g. ancient techniques of productions, local identity) ...|$|R

40|$|Tie-rods have an {{important}} structural role {{in most of the}} vaulted constructions due to their capacity to balance the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts.</b> However, their reliability in ancient buildings is often impaired by the manufacturing technology and the incidence of defects. One paradigmatic example is represented by Duomo di Milano, whose hand forged elements date back to {{the first half of the}} 15 th century and have been the object of the metallurgical characterization herein presented. The occasion arose from the replacement of a deeply fractured tie-rod, two cross-sections of which were analyzed in details: one close to the breaking surface and the breaking surface itself. The investigations carried out on the first sample were aimed to characterize the material, while those performed on the second one were finalized to estimate the causes of the failure. Stereoscopy, light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Vickers hardness tests were employed to analyze the local chemical composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the material. A good agreement among the results of these analyses was found. The insight into the quality of this wrought iron is of remarkable significance as concerns the representativeness of laboratory mechanical tests and the potential of diagnostic techniques for in-situ inspection...|$|R

However, few studies have conducted on the mechanical behaviour of metallic tie-rods in the last years and most of them are devoted to the identification of the axial stress. This results in rather unreliable models of these reinforcing elements, based on simplified constitutive laws (usually disregarding deformability issues, that play a fundamental role in modern seismic engineering) and on conventional material properties (usually extrapolated from those of modern ferrous alloys, or from some literature tests on XIX century steel bridges). At a bigger scale, this results in rather unreliable models of heritage buildings, leading to unreliable safety assessment procedures and unaware consolidation interventions (mostly replacements). The paper present the first results of an on-going study on the mechanical characterization of ancient iron tie-rods, based on experimental tests performed on a set of real tie-rods recovered from restoration works or building demolitions. Dealing with a structural ferrous material produced by bloomery smelting (an ironmaking process used in ancient items in Europe) and therefore potentially rich in inclusions and poor in alloying elements, tests of both metallographic and mechanical nature are introduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the concrete floor {{presented in this paper}} consists of a thin funicular vault, quadrilateral in plan, supported on its four corners, and stiffened by a system of “ribs ” walls on its extrados. The structural prototype is completed with tension ties, which link the supports and absorb the <b>horizontal</b> <b>thrusts</b> of the funicular shell. It is a prototype for the NEST-HiLo project to be realized late 2015 in Dübendorf, Switzerland. The solution is inspired by built examples in tile vaulting in which thin vaults are stiffened by diaphragms, also called spandrel walls. In the presented structure, this structural system is implemented and constructed in high-performance concrete to achieve an extreme thinness (2 cm in the case of this prototype for both vault and ribs) and to resist asymmetrical loading. This floor would thus save more than 70 % of weight compared to traditional, 25 - 30 cm thick concrete floor slabs used in the construction of framed buildings. This directly lowers the requirements for the foundations (often a dominant resource and cost factor), but also enables lightweight building extensions and a reduction of total floor height, offering possibilities to address, among other issues, the vertical densification of cities. A form-finding and analysis procedure for the design of such floor systems is presented, which consists of consecutive topology, shape and size optimizations...|$|R

50|$|In geology {{the term}} {{compression}} {{refers to a}} set of stress directed toward the center of a rock mass. Compressive strength refers to the maximum compressive stress that can be applied to a material before failure occurs. When the maximum compressive stress is in a <b>horizontal</b> orientation, <b>thrust</b> faulting can occur, resulting in the shortening and thickening of that portion of the crust. When the maximum compressive stress is vertical, a section of rock will often fail in normal faults, horizontally extending and vertically thinning a given layer of rock. Compressive stresses can also result in folding of rocks. Because of the large magnitudes of lithostatic stress in tectonic plates, tectonic-scale deformation is always subjected to net compressive stress.|$|R
