This work studied the {{antioxidant}} activities of the defatted methanolic extracts (ME) of canes from 11 genotypes: 5 Vitis vinifera widely known cultivars and 6 Chinese wild varieties from three species (V. amurensis, V. davidii, and V. pentagona) and the antioxidant activities of the ME’s chloroform <b>fractions</b> (CF), <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> (<b>EAF)</b> and water <b>fractions</b> (WF). Among ME and its three <b>fractions,</b> <b>EAF’s</b> total phenolic contents (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) were the highest, at 586 mg/g of gallic acid equivalent and 320 mg/g of quercetin equivalent, respectively. The antioxidant power of the fractions/extracts was in the order EAF > ME > WF > CF, based on the DPPH radical-scavenging power and ferric-reducing antioxidant activity, while the order was EAF > CF > WF >ME based on the β-carotene-linoleic acid bleaching activity. Methanolic extracts demonstrated the strongest Fe 2 +-chelating activity. The antioxidant activities of the extracts/fractions generally correlated with the TPC and TFC in all assays, except with the Fe 2 +-chelating test. Grape canes from V. davidii had the highest TPC, TFC and antioxidant activities compared with those from other grape species. Catechin, epicatechin and trans-resveratrol were the predominant phenolic components of fractions/extracts.

In addition, the EAF exhibited strong anticancer activities against human gastric carcinoma (SGC- 7901), human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG- 2) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A- 549) cancer cell lines, higher than cisplatin, a conventional anticancer drug. The total phenolic content of wampee fraction {{was positively correlated with}} the antioxidant activity. This is the first report on the antioxidant and anticancer {{activities of}} the wampee peel extract. Thus, wampee peel can be used potentially as a readily accessible source of natural antioxidants and a possible pharmaceutical supplement. Copyright © 2009 K. Nagendra Prasad et al.

Single doses (150 mg/kg, i. p.) of C. roseus extracts in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were determined in normal and SIDRs on 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 16, and 24 th hours and serum triglyceride (TG) and serum total cholesterol (TC) levels were determined after 24 th hour. In normoglycemic rats and in SIDRs, petroleum-ether and <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> of C. roseus reduced blood glucose level significantly. In case of hypolipidemic effects, all fractions reduced serum total cholesterol but the <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> of C. roseus was the most effective.

(Receptaculum Nelumbinis) were investigated using two in vitro antioxidant assays. BF showed the highest total phenolic content (607. 6 mg/g gallic acid equivalents), total flavonoid content (862. 7 mg/g rutin equivalents) and total proanthocyanidin content (331. 0 mg/g catechin equivalents), accompanied {{with the highest}} antioxidant activity compared to other fractions through 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 '-azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays. Five flavonol glycosides, namely hyperoside (1), isoquercitrin (2), quercetin- 3 -O-β-D-glucuronide (3), isorhamnetin- 3 -O-β-D-galactoside (4) and syringetin- 3 -O-β-D-glucoside (5) were isolated from the Receptaculum Nelumbinis.

40|$|During ageing, {{elasticity}} {{of the skin}} decreases due to enzyme elastase leads to sagging {{and at the same}} time hyaluronic acid in the skin also diminishes and skin becomes dry and wrinkled. Hence, there is need to conserve matrix metallo proteins by inhibiting the activity of these matrix metallo proteinases. Certain plant extracts are reported to be good antioxidants. Garcinol and cambogiol present in the fruit rinds of Garcinia indica were reported to be good antioxidants due to presence of phenolic group. Along with this various preparations of G. indica have shown significant antioxidant ability. To check whether fractions separated from fruit rinds of G. indica play a role in prolonging ageing, we fractionated crude Methanolic Extract (ME) into ethyl acetate and Water Fraction (WF) and those fractions were screened for anti-hyaluronidase and anti-elastase activity. Among tested three fractions, <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Acetate</b> <b>Fraction</b> (<b>EAF)</b> at concentrations as low as 25 μg mL - 1 showed significant hyaluronidase inhibition while water fraction proved to be good elastase and hyaluronidase inhibitor at 90 μg mL - 1.

40|$|In this study, the antioxidative {{fraction}} of white mulberry (Morus alba) {{was found to}} have an apotogenic effect on Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma cell-induced mice (EAC mice) that correlate with upregulated p 53 and downregulated NFκB signaling. The antioxidant activities and polyphenolic contents of various mulberry fractions were evaluated by spectrophotometry and the <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> (<b>EAF)</b> was selected for further analysis. Strikingly, the EAF caused 70. 20 % tumor growth inhibition with S-phase cell cycle arrest, normalized blood parameters including red/white blood cell counts and suppressed the tumor weight of EAC mice compared with untreated controls. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of EAF-treated EAC cells revealed DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blebbing. These characteristic morphological features of apoptosis influenced us to further investigate pro- and anti-apoptotic signals in EAF-treated EAC mice. Interestingly, apoptosis correlated with the upregulation of p 53 and its target genes PARP- 1 and Bax, and also with the down-regulation of NFκB and its target genes Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL. Our results suggest that the tumor- suppressive effect of the antioxidative {{fraction of}} white mulberry is likely due to apoptosis mediated by p 53 and NFκB signaling...|$|E
