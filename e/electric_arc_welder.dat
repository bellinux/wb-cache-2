5000|$|Arc has {{historical}} significance since several innovative models were {{the inspiration for}} flashlights later produced by other companies. These products included the first LED flashlight powered by a single AAA battery, the first temperature-compensated LED flashlight, and the first microprocessor controlled Luxeon Star flashlight. Possibly the most significant innovation was the first flashlight using the high power Luxeon Star LED, the Arc LS—the first solid-state LED flashlight to produce output comparable to incandescent bulb designs. The name [...] "Arc" [...] came from intense white light some LEDs produce, looking similar {{to the color of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The depots at Brisbane, Townsville and Port Moresby {{continued}} to be marked by the variety of their activities. They not only had to overhaul engines, inspect and repair parachutes, paint aircraft, fill oxygen cylinders, and install armament but {{they were expected to}} find all sorts of short cuts and to make odd pieces of equipment from material on hand. The machine shop at Townsville produced, among other things, special propeller tools, a jig-filing machine, an indicating apparatus for hollow-steel propellers, and an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welder</b> for high-melting point soldering on armatures. ... By September 1943, the Townsville depot had converted some 175 B-25C's and D's for low-level strafing, and then turned to the B-25G. Between November and the following April, it would add on eighty-two planes two additional [...]50-cal. machine guns in the nose, two more in the gun tunnel, and a stinger of twin [...]30's in the tail - modifications requiring 234 man-hours per plane.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Welding is {{associated}} with workplace hazards that can affect the health of those who engaged in it as {{they are exposed to}} harmful dust. Subjects and Methods: This was a health education intervention study carried out among self-employed <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welder.</b> Data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire and health education intervention was carried out between the preintervention and postintervention stages. Epi-info version 3. 5. 1 software package was used for data analysis and Chi-square analysis was used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences between the study and control groups before the intervention and after intervention. Level of significance was set at a P < 0. 05. Results: At the preintervention phase, 285 respondents were interviewed in each of the study and control groups, while 280 study respondents and 275 control respondents were available for the postintervention phase of the study. Before the intervention, 279 (97. 9 %) of the respondents in the study group were aware of eye goggles as a means of protection, 20 (7 %) were aware of welding helmet, 206 (72. 3 %) were aware of hand gloves and 4 (1. 4 %) were aware of face mask. All showed a significant increase in awareness postintervention (P < 0. 05) while there was no significant increase in awareness in the control group. Conclusion: Health education brought about a significant increase in awareness and use of personal protective equipment among the welders. There is a need for proper education of welders on workplace hazards, the types and use of different protective devices in other to safeguard their health...|$|E

Since GMAW employs an <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>welders</b> wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the <b>electric</b> <b>arc.</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction Welding work is {{associated}} with the inhalation of fumes and accumulation of particulates in welders' lungs. It is assumed that particulates deposited in the respiratory system, mainly consisting of iron oxides, are eliminated by several mechanisms, such as muco-ciliary transport and macrophage phagocytosis. In their cross-sectional study of 42 Finnish shipyard <b>arc</b> <b>welders,</b> Kalliomki et al. indicated that from 10 to 20 % of total accumulated welding particulates from fumes was eliminated annually from welders' lungs [1]. However, longitudinal changes in the lung deposition of welding particulates have not yet been fully described.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{technical}} solution to implement arc welding installation.

If the installation is connected to the end of the feeder, the impact on neighboring consumers is so large that can be damaged appliances. The proposed technical solution is based on the idea of using the battery as a buffer. The battery is designed so that its capacity was sufficient to meet the instantaneous current peaks that occur during operation. Along with this, in the proposed technical solution, an innovative element is a current pulse source. The novelty lies in the special algorithm of this current source. The proposed algorithm allows the power consumption of the network in a controlled manner and without abrupt jumps...|$|R
40|$|Welding is {{a process}} in which two or more metals are {{attached}} by the use of heat and, in some cases, pressure. Direct exposure and inhalation of welding fumes causes acute and chronic side effects in humans. Kidney damage is one of these important side effects. β 2 microglobulin is an 11. 8 kilodalton protein and levels increase in the case of some inflammatory and viral diseases, or kidney malfunction and autoimmune diseases. In this study measurements of β 2 microglobulin were used as a criterion for assessing effects on the kidneys of workers exposed to welding fumes. The study population were <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> in an industrial plant in Tehran, Iran. For control we selected workers who did not have any exposure to welding fumes. Both groups were {{selected on the basis of}} a questionnaire and the consideration of criteria for inclusion and exclusion. In the end 50 cases and 50 controls were chosen. A urine sample was collected from all participants and urinary pH was set to between 6 - 8 using NaOH (1 M). Sample transportation to the laboratory complied with the related standards. The samples were assessed using the ORG 5 BM kit. For quantitative assessment of β 2 microglobulin we used the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. The ages of the welders ranged from 21 to 48 years (mean= 30. 5 ± 5. 9 yrs) and of controls from 23 to 56 years (mean= 31. 8 ± 5. 9 yrs). Mean employment duration was 7. 86 ± 5. 01 years (range 2 to 27 years) for welders. Mean β 2 microglobulin level was 0. 10 ± 0. 096 μg/ml in welders and 0. 11 ± 0. 06 in controls. This difference was not statistically significant (P= 0. 381). In conclusion we don't find that exposure to <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> welding fumes cause a significant change in urinary β 2 microglobulin compared to the control group...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar macrophages are {{essential}} components of pulmonary defense. They are unique among mononuclear phagocytes in having direct exposure to inhaled microorganisms and environmental toxins {{and in their}} metabolic adaptations to the aerobic environment. On the other hand, they {{are thought to have}} some properties common to all mononuclear phagocytes which constitute the reticuloendothelial system. Moreover, the ironladen alveolar macrophages seem {{to play a role in}} the induction of tissue injury and iron transport of the lung. In this experiment, the functions of alveolar macrophages, namely, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, β-galactosidase activity and superoxide production were studied in patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung, other lung diseases and normal adults as controls. No significant difference was present in the chemotaxis of alveolar macrophages to zymosan activated serum between normal subjects and patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. The phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles by alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung was less than that of normal subjects. No significant difference was observed in the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages between normal subjects and patients with lung diseases except for <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung.

40|$|In arc welding, {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from the welding electrode to the base metal by an <b>electric</b> <b>arc.</b> When the <b>welder</b> starts the <b>arc,</b> both the base metal and the filler metal are melted to create the weld. This melting is possi-ble because a sufficient amount of power (energy transferred per unit time) and energy density is supplied to the electrode. Heat input is a relative measure of the energy transferred per unit length of weld. It is an important characteristic because, like preheat and interpass temperature, it influences the cooling rate, which may affect the mechanical properties and metallurgical structure of the weld and the HAZ (see Figure 1). Heat input is typically calculated as {{the ratio of the}} power (i. e., voltage x current) to the velocity of the heat source (i. e., the arc) as follows: where, H = heat input (kJ/in or kJ/mm) E = arc voltage (volts) I = current (amps) S = travel speed (in/min or mm/min) This equation is useful for comparing different welding procedures for a given welding process. However, heat input is not necessarily applicable for comparing different processes (e. g., SMAW and GMAW), unless additional data are available such as the hea...|$|R

40|$|A new {{generation}} of <b>arc</b> <b>welder</b> has recently become widely available at a price which is within reach of most amateurs and part-time mechanics, known as the MIG welder (metal-arc inert gas welder). In MIG welding the arc is ensheathed in a stream of inert gas which prevents the molten metal from oxidising. The stream of gas changes {{the character of the}} emitted radiation, and it is possible that this type of welder poses a greater threat to sight than previously recognised. Radiation in the ultraviolet range emitted by <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> is absorbed by the unprotected cornea and lens, giving rise to a keratoconjunctivitis, or 'arc-eye,' which, though intensely painful, is not considered a threat to sight. Radiation in the visible and near infrared spectrum, however, penetrates the eye to be absorbed by the retina and may cause thermal or photochemical damage which may be permanent and sight-threatening. Retinal injuries resulting from exposure to ordinary <b>electric</b> welding <b>arcs</b> have been reported, but such injuries are uncommon.
