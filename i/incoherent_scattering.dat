The measurements {{used in the}} study were collected by connecting a computer-based receiver to the EISCAT (European <b>Incoherent</b> <b>SCATter)</b> radar on Svalbard. This hardware consists of a spectrum analyzer, a PCI-bus-based programmable digital I/O card and a desktop computer with a large-capacity hard disk. It takes in the 70 -MHz signal from the ESR (Eiscat Svalbard Radar) signal path and carries out downconversion, AD conversion, quadrature detection, and nally stores the output samples ective sampling rate is 1 MHz, large enough to span all the frequency channels used in the experiment. Hence the total multichannel signal was stored instead of separate lagged products for each frequency channel, which is the procedure in the standard hardware. This solution has some benets including elimination of ground clutter with only a small loss in statistical accuracy. The capability of our hardware in storing the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar signals directly allows us to use very exible and versatile signal processing methods, which include clutter suppression, ltering, decoding, lag prole calculation, inversion and optimal height integration. The performance of these <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar measurement techniques and data analysis methods are demonstrated by employing an <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> experiment that applies a new binary phase code. Each bit of this code has been further coded by a 5 -bit Barker code. In the analysis, stochastic inversion has been used for the rst time in decoding Barker-coded <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> measurements, and this method takes care of the ambiguity problems associated with the measurements. Finally, we present new binary phase codes with corresponding sidelobe-free decoding lters that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{and at the same time}} eliminate unwanted sidelobes completely...|$|R

Because of these factors, {{as well as the}} much larger <b>incoherent</b> <b>scattering</b> cross section of protium, ordinary proteins cannot be imaged as well as those that are fully deuterated.

40|$|Abstract From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of modern ionospheric science, different radar applications have been utilised in ionospheric measurements. The most sophisticated ionospheric radars are the <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars, which detect the extremely weak scattering of radio waves from thermal fluctuations in the ionospheric plasma. Besides the low signal level, the stochastic nature of the scattering process causes further complications to the measurements. The scattering produces a zero-mean random signal, whose autocorrelation function contains the information of the ionospheric plasma parameters. <b>Incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars have been used for about half a century, but the demanding task of developing transmission modulation and data analysis is still in progress. In this thesis, a statistical inversion based method for removing range ambiguities from the autocorrelation functions, lag profile inversion, is applied to <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar data. The data have been recorded with the EISCAT <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radars, located in Northern Fennoscandia. The method is first applied to standard EISCAT experiments, the results giving strong evidence that the method is applicable for the purpose, and it provides results of at least equal quality with the present standard methods. In subsequent studies, new radar modulation methods are developed, which may provide significant improvements to the present <b>incoherent</b> <b>scatter</b> radar experiments. All the methods have been tested with a real radar, and lag profile inversion has been successfully applied to the recorded data. The methods are also put to use in order to measure the predicted effects of artificial heating of the free electrons in the D-region of the ionosphere...|$|R
