5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> view the film, creating {{the illusion that}} elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} {{evaluation of a}} two-way hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar collector was analytically and experimentally carried out. Mathematical expressions for operating parameters in <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV/T solar collectors were developed and experimentally validated by a <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV/T solar collector system. Also the influence of air flow rate on the solar collector performance was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> PV/T solar collector gave higher outlet air temperature, cell temperature and thermal efficiency than the <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV/T solar collector. However, back surface temperature and electrical efficiency were higher in case of <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar collector. Increasing the air flow rate led to a lower outlet air temperature and a higher electrical efficiency of the photovoltaic module. Maximum experimental electrical efficiency, thermal efficiency and overall thermal efficiency for the <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV module were found to be 10. 35, 57. 9 and 84. 5 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{electrical}} {{efficiency of the}} photovoltaic (PV) module can be increased by reducing {{the temperature of the}} PV module by withdrawing the thermal energy associated with the PV module. In this communication an attempt has been made to develop analytical expression for {{electrical efficiency}} of PV module with and without flow as a function of climatic and design parameters. The four different configurations of PV modules are considered for the present study which are defined as; case A (<b>Glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> PV module with duct), case B (<b>Glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> PV module without duct), case C (<b>Glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV module with duct), case D (<b>Glass</b> <b>to</b> tedlar PV module without duct). Further, experiments were carried out for all configurations under composite climate of New Delhi. It is found that the <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> PV modules with duct gives higher electrical efficiency as well as the higher outlet air temperature amongst the all four cases. The annual effect on electrical efficiency of <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> type PV module with and without duct is also evaluated. The annual average efficiency of <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> <b>glass</b> type PV module with and without duct is 10. 41 % and 9. 75 %, respectively.

Radcliffe has urged his fans to make donations, in lieu of Christmas presents to him, to the charity's Candle for Care program. In 2008 he was among several celebrities who donated their old <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> an exhibit honouring victims of the Holocaust. During the Broadway run of Equus he auctioned off a pair of jeans and other items worn in the show, for New-York-based Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. and presenting at the 2011 Gypsy of the Year competition. He has also donated money to Get Connected UK, a London-based free confidential national helpline for troubled youth.|$|E
5|$|Mission {{objectives}} vary {{in quantity}} and length {{depending on the}} difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, {{and the availability of}} the game's optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player can also use night vision or X-ray vision <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E

25|$|In the 13th {{century in}} medieval Europe, English bishop Robert Grosseteste wrote {{on a wide}} range of {{scientific}} topics, and discussed light from four different perspectives: an epistemology of light, a metaphysics or cosmogony of light, an etiology or physics of light, and a theology of light, basing it on the works Aristotle and Platonism. Grosseteste's most famous disciple, Roger Bacon, wrote works citing a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of Alhazen, Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Euclid, al-Kindi, Ptolemy, Tideus, and Constantine the African. Bacon was able to use parts of glass spheres as magnifying <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from them.|$|E
25|$|Baird also {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} the two-color tube as the basis for stereoscopic 3D television. In this use, the two color-filtered television cameras were separated to produce a measurable angle, and then broadcast normally. Viewers wore colored <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> re-separate the images into the left and right eye, in a fashion identical to Anaglyph 3D movies. However, Baird also described a system using the ridged tube that eliminated the need for glasses. In this case the tube was rotated so the peaks ran vertically instead of horizontally and the red gun was removed. The guns formerly used for green and blue were now used for left and right images. The basic concept is identical to the lenticular printing system used on magazines and other printed materials to produce 3D images.|$|E

Returning to the side for Bihar's last Ranji Trophy game in 1958–59, he made the equal top score for the match, 17 not out, in the second innings in a match in Patna in which only 188 runs were scored for the loss of 32 wickets. After being dismissed for 49 in their first innings, Bihar needed 45 to beat Orissa and were 19 for 2 when Mukherjee came to the wicket and shared an unbroken partnership of 27, the highest partnership of the match, to take Bihar to victory.|$|E

The purpose of the masks it convert participants into other beings or characters. This element is so important in many events that if a dancer does not use a mask, he often wears dark <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> indicate that he is not his normal self. A double sense of masking is to use dark glasses over a mask. With few exceptions, dances are performed by males, who play female roles wearing masks. The reason for this is that it was not considered proper for women in Europe to act or dance, a prohibition brought to Mexico by the Spanish. One important character of this type is La Malinche, in dances about the Conquest.|$|E
