40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purposes}} of this study were: to compare the strength (single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load),</b> the elongation and the evenness of four types represented by 11 brands of polyester sewing threads available on the market in Corvallis, Oregon in January, 1976; to determine whether there were differences in the strength and elongation of black and white threads; and to find the correlations between: the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of a thread; the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the elongation of a thread; and the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the evenness of a thread. The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, short staple spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>loads,</b> corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; short staple spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by short staple spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and short staple spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the short staple spun threads; short staple spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and elongation of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar. Based on this study, the tow spun threads would be a good choice for fabrics with normal extensibility. Two of the three corespun 3 -ply threads would be suitable for fabrics which stretch more. No significant correlations were found between: single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and loop <b>breaking</b> load; single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and evenness; and loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and evenness. Although a high positive correlation between single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and elongation was not significant at the. 05 level, the relationship appears fruitful for further study because only the tow spun threads and one of the short staple spun threads had a much lower rate of elongation relative to the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R

To examine the {{advantages}} of cotton gill nets, we analyzed changes in mesh <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of a new cotton gill net used in a fishing operation. A new cotton gill net was also soaked in a seawater tank to simulate ghost fishing conditions. The average mesh <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of new cotton mesh was 50. 3 N. This value decreased to 19. 0 N after 38 days (∼ 912 h), and after 82 days (∼ 1968 h) the mesh could be easily torn (<b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> 0. 07 N). Under fishing conditions, the cumulative soak time was only 744. 4 h over 19 months. The average <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> {{at the end of}} this period was 43. 1 N, a strength 86 % that of the presoaked mesh. The mesh <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of a cotton gill net continuously soaked for 744. 4 h was 26. 1 N, as estimated from tank experiment data.

40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the decrease in}} ductility caused by an induced stress concentration {{as a function of}} various levels of cold work and heat treatment, Nitinol medical guide wires with a. 004 ″ diameter were tested using both a standard, straight tensile test and a modified, bent tensile test. The ratio of the two <b>break</b> <b>loads</b> (bent:straight) for identically processed samples was used as a proxy for measuring the ductility of the guide wires: the higher the ratio, the more ductile the sample. The average <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio as a function of increased cold work, decreased from 1. 27 to 0. 91 for the heat treated samples, and decreased from 1. 28 to 1. 13 for the non-heat treated samples. The heat treated wires had lower <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratios - a difference of 0. 105 on average - compared to the similarly cold worked, non-heat treated wires. The magnitude of the decrease in <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio between heat treated and non-heat treated wires is dependent on the level of cold work; there was a difference of 0. 01 for the lowest level of cold work, and a difference of 0. 22 for the highest level of cold work. The decrease in <b>break</b> <b>load</b> - and ductility by proxy - from increased cold work and heat exposure is caused by the suppression of the austenite-martensite phase transformation {{as a result of these}} processes...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{material}} properties {{is necessary for}} design purposes {{and has been a}} topic of research for many years. Over the last several decades, much {{progress has been made in}} identifying metrics to describe fracture mechanics properties and developing procedures to measure the appropriate values. However, in the context of design, there has not been as much success in quantifying the susceptibility of a material to corrosion damage and its subsequent impact on material behavior in the framework of fracture mechanics. A natural next step in understanding the effects of corrosion damage was to develop a link between standard material test procedures and fatigue life in the presence of corrosion. Simply stated, the goal of this investigation was to formulate a cheaper and quicker method for assessing the consequences of corrosion on remaining fatigue life. ^ For this study, <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens and fatigue specimens of a single nominal gage (0. 063 ″) of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 were exposed to three levels of corrosion. The <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens were taken from three different material lots, and the fatigue tests were carried out at three stress levels. All failed specimens, both <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and fatigue specimens, were examined to characterize the damage state(s) and failure mechanism(s). Correlations between <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> results and fatigue life results in the presence of corrosion damage were developed using a fracture mechanics foundation and the observed mechanisms of failure. Where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests showed a decrease in strength due to increased corrosion exposure, the corresponding set of fatigue tests showed a decrease in life. And where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests from different specimen orientations exhibited similar levels of strength, the corresponding set of fatigue specimens showed similar lives. The spread from shortest to longest fatigue lives among the different corrosion conditions decreased at the higher stress levels. Life predictions based on <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> data were generally shorter than the experimental lives by an average of 20 %. The life prediction methodology developed from this investigation is a very valuable tool for the purpose of assessing material substitution for aircraft designers, alloy differentiation for manufacturers, or inspection intervals and aircraft retirement schedules for aircraft in service. ...|$|R

Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in loop breaking elongation existed among the brands. Variation in loop breaking elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads. The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread.

This interface-fiber system offers a low cost alternative to CVD deposition of coatings on alumina and silicon carbide fibers. Ceramic fiber composites were made with 6 infiltration/pyrolysis cycles of a nitrided multifilament Nextel(TM) 312 mini-tow, using Blackglas(TM) resin to produce a silicon oxycarbide matrix. In the as-prepared condition the Nextel-Blackglas(TM) mini-tow composites had a mean tensile <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of 53 Newtons, a coefficient of variation of 26 %, and limited fiber pull-out.

30|$|One can {{speculate}} on the reason for organic graft failure in sacral colpopexy. The mechanical properties depend on the metabolic phase of the graft material—degeneration, revascularization, fibroplasia, and maturation of the collagen. During maturization vascularity and cellularity decrease and nuclei are arranged longitudinally. In this way the allograft serves as a scaffold for collagen formation, while it is fully substituted by vital collagen. Freeze-dried fascia lata in {{the reconstruction of the}} anterior cruciate ligament in dogs is complete in a mean time of 29  months [7]. During this process the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> in biomechanical testing changes [9]. In a experiment with dogs the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of the anterior cruciate ligament 3  weeks after implantation was equal to that of the contralateral ligament. After 6  weeks the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of the operated side was only 19 % compared with the contralateral side, after 12  weeks 14 % and after 24  weeks 51 %. Because it is impossible to prevent full stress on the implanted graft during recovery after sacral colpopexy (as a consequence of coughing, vomiting, constipation, walking, etc.), the graft—in the phase of reduced strength—may not withstand these forces and may break down.|$|R

Both the specimens tested for the required number of fatigue cycles (97000 cycles as per ASME, Mandatory Appendix 6) towards the structural integrity demonstration. At the end of fatigue testing, the maximum linear indication of the surface defect of the weld area increased from 20 mm to 25 mm without any loss of integrity.
