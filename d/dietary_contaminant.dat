The system is based on the use of four complementary cellular tools, namely stress gene induction in transgenic strains of Escherichia coli, modulation of the activity of key biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 and 3 A 4) in a human intestinal cell line, and activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and estrogenic receptor (ER) -dependent genes in agonistic and antagonistic assays with luciferase reporter cells.

40|$|The potent {{experimental}} renal carcinogenesis of ochratoxin A (OTA) in male rats {{makes the}} <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminant</b> a potential factor in human oncology. We explored whether the tumour promoter sodium barbitate could shorten the otherwise long latency between exposure to toxin and tumourigenesis. Young rats, of a hybrid in which mononuclear leukaemia was rare, were given feed contaminated (5 ppm) with OTA for 36 weeks to initiate renal tumourigenesis. Some individuals were thereafter given sodium barbitate (500 ppm in drinking water) for life. Pathological outcomes were studied {{at or near}} the end of natural life. Renal tumours in males given barbitate became evident after latency of one year, but only slightly before those without barbitate. In contrast, female mammary tumourigenesis was advanced by at least 6 months synchronously in all rats given the OTA-barbitate regimen compared to tumourigenesis in controls. Diagnosis of malignant mammary angiosarcoma in a female given the OTA-barbitate regimen is a new finding in the rat.

Reasons for the long latency are unclear, as is whether there would be a similar carcinogenic response if toxin exposure started at one year of age. Therefore, 24 male Fischer rats were given 100 µg ochratoxin A as a daily <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminant</b> for 35 weeks from age 50 weeks.

The findings raise new questions about a difference between young adults and mature adults in sensitivity of male rats to the ochratoxin A-induced DNA damage necessary for renal carcinogenesis. A pilot histological study of perfuse-fixed brains of the toxin-treated rats showed no gross abnormalities, correlating with the consistent absence of behavioral or neurological disorders from chronic ochratoxin A exposure regimens in the range 100 - 250 µg/kg/day during the second half of life.

Animals were exposed to MeHg (10 µM) from embryo to larval 4 (L 4) stage and RNAs were isolated. RNA-seq analysis on the Illumina platform revealed 541 genes up- and 261 genes down-regulated at a cutoff of 2 -fold change and false discovery rate-corrected significance q < 0. 05. Among the up-regulated genes were those previously shown to increase under oxidative stress conditions including hsp- 16. 11 (2. 5 -fold), gst- 35 (10. 1 -fold), and fmo- 2 (58. 5 -fold). In addition, we observed up-regulation of 6 out of 7 lipocalin related (lpr) family genes and down regulation of 7 out of 15 activated in blocked unfolded protein response (abu) genes.

Our results demonstrate the effects of MeHg on specific transcripts encoding proteins in oxidative stress responses and in ER stress pathways.

The present study focused on the hematotoxic effects of ACR and the {{protective}} efficacy of Extra Virgin olive oil (EVOO) in alleviating hematotoxicity and oxidative stress in erythrocytes of adult rats. Rats were divided into four groups of six each: group 1, serving as negative controls, received distilled water; group 2 received by  gavage ACR at a dose of 40 mg/ kg body weight; group 3 received by gavage ACR supplemented with EVOO (300 μL); group 4,serving as positive controls, received only EVOO by gavage. All groups were sacrificed after three weeks. Acrylamide induced a significant increase in white blood cells (WBC), erythrocyte osmotic fragility (OF) and a decrease in red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Ht). While mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and MCH concentration (MCHC) remained unchanged. Furthermore, exposure of rats to ACR induced erythrocytes oxidative stress with an increase of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and protein carbonyls levels. A reduction in antioxidant status, enzymatic (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and non enzymatic (reduced glutathione, non protein thiols and vitamin C) was observed when compared to controls.

However, inorganic Cd salts do not represent the main form of Cd exposure in general human populations. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare the estrogen-like effects and the bioavailability of dietary Cd to inorganic CdCl(2). Adult ovariectomized ERE-luc reporter mice were administered two bread based diets containing different concentrations of Cd (17. 57 and 49. 22 μg/kg, corresponding to oral intakes of 1. 8 and 5. 1 μg/kg body weight (bw) per day, respectively), inorganic CdCl(2) (1 μg/kg bw per day by gavage) or E(2) (5 μg/kg bw per day pellet) for 21 days. The effects on estrogen signaling were investigated by studying the uterine weights, luciferase activation, and expression of endogenous estrogen target genes. The uterine weight was significantly increased by both CdCl(2) and E(2) but not by the Cd containing diets. All treatments modulated the expression of luciferase and the endogenous estrogen target genes; however, there was no consistent overlap between the responses triggered by the bread diets and the responses stimulated by CdCl(2) or E(2). Oral exposure to Cd was calculated and the concentrations in liver and kidneys quantified to estimate the amount of absorbed Cd retained in tissues. The results suggest significantly lower absorption and/or tissue retention of dietary Cd compared to CdCl(2) following oral exposure. Altogether, our results support previous reports on in vivo estrogenicity of CdCl(2) but do not suggest the same activity for diet bound Cd. This study calls for caution when extrapolating results from pure compound studies (e. g. estrogenicity of CdCl(2)) to dietary exposure scenarios (e. g. estrogenicity of diet bound Cd).

However, they remain poorly characterized in humans. The {{present study was}} therefore designed to evaluate human intestine and brain permeation for a large set of pesticides (n = 338) belonging to various chemical classes, using an in silico graphical BOILED-Egg/SwissADME online method based on lipophilicity and polarity that was initially developed for drugs. A high percentage of the pesticides (81. 4 %) was predicted to exhibit high intestinal absorption, with a high accuracy (96 %), whereas a lower, but substantial, percentage (38. 5 %) displayed brain permeation. Among the pesticide classes, organochlorines (n = 30) constitute the class with the lowest percentage of intestine-permeant members (40 %), whereas that of the organophosphorus compounds (n = 99) has the lowest percentage of brain-permeant chemicals (9 %). The predictions of the permeations for the pesticides were additionally shown to be significantly associated with various molecular descriptors well-known to discriminate between permeant and non-permeant drugs. Overall, our in silico data suggest that human exposure to pesticides through the oral way is {{likely to result in}} an intake of these <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants</b> for most of them and brain permeation for some of them, thus supporting the idea that they have toxic effects on human health, including neurotoxic effects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMycotoxins {{are common}} <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants</b> in most {{regions of the}} world. The {{frequency}} {{of exposure to the}} different families of mycotoxins is often dependent upon geographic location, national wealth and related agricultural and regulatory infrastructure, combined with how diverse a diet is available, and the degree of food sufficiency. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium mycotoxin that frequently contaminates wheat, corn and barley in temperate regions of the world. A number of acute poisoning incidences have been linked to DON contaminated foods, and chronic exposure to lower levels of DON has been predicted in many regions. DON is a potent animal toxin, and exposure in humans may cause gastroenteritis, growth faltering and immune toxicity. The ability to conduct accurate exposure assessment at the individual level is required in order to fully understand the potential health consequences of human exposure. To date, such exposure biomarkers have been lacking for many important mycotoxins, including DON. To better assess exposure to DON at the individual level we have developed a robust urinary assay, incorporating immunoaffinity column (IAC) enrichment and LC-MS detection. Further refinement of this urinary assay, by inclusion of 13 C-DON as an internal standard was then undertaken, and tested within the UK. Urinary DON was frequently observed in the urine and was significantly associated with cereal intake. A dietary intervention study demonstrated that avoiding wheat in the diet markedly reduced urinary levels of DON.

The need for relevant toxicological data, generated at plausible exposure, is therefore encouraging researchers to develop new approaches of risk assessment, adapted to the specificities of herbal dietary supplements, as well as high-throughput in vitro screening tools. Due its high potential of first-pass metabolization, the small intestine, which is exposed to high doses of diverse dietary compounds, {{plays a key role in}} food safety. In a first part of the work, a review of the interactions between <b>dietary</b> compounds, including <b>contaminants</b> and phytochemicals, and main first-pass biotransformation enzymes permitted to highlight the major role of cytochrome P- 450 (CYP), and especially CYP 1 A 1, in determining bioavailability and potential toxicity at the intestinal level. We therefore dedicated the first experimental part of the work to the study of the modulation of CYP 1 A 1 activity by Ginkgo biloba, a widely used herbal dietary supplement, and by its major active compounds, alone or in mixtures, in the human intestinal Caco- 2 cells, at realistic exposure. Ginkgo biloba extracts demonstrated to strongly enhance CYP 1 A 1 activity, suggesting unsuspected side effects for consumers. In a second experimental part, on the basis of our previous experience with Caco- 2 cells, we set up an original methodology, involving four distinct in vitro tools packed together in a toolbox, and permitting to easily investigate relevant toxicological effects of dietary compounds at realistic human exposure, with a special interest for the intestinal compartment. This method was validated with four well-known <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants</b> showing human health concern (ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, imazalil and benomyl), in order to be applied in the future to other less studied chemicals, such as active compounds of herbal dietary supplements.

Analytical technique is considered in relation to folate and selenium, and flavonoid and carotenoid species are used to illustrate how the metabolism of a compound may alter the validity or adequacy of a marker. Vitamin A is discussed in relation to the difficulties which can arise when there are several biomarkers that may be available to assess exposure to one nutrient. Vitamin B 12 is discussed in relation to the dietary choices made by individuals. Possible interactions and the role of measuring total antioxidant capacity is considered in some detail. In contrast to most nutrients, there is a marked lack of biomarkers of either exposure or effect for most non-nutrients. The role of biological effect monitoring is considered for <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants,</b> fumonisins and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Aflatoxins are discussed to exemplify food contaminants for which the biomarker approach has been extensively studied. Finally some compounds which are deliberately added to foods and some which appear as processing contaminants are each considered briefly in relation to the requirement for a biomarker of exposure to be developed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Factors that {{influenced}} the uptake, storage, and elimination of dietary quinoline by rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were studied {{to obtain an}} understanding of the mechanisms affecting the bioaccumulation of <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants</b> in teleosts. Rainbow trout readily absorbed ¹⁴C-quinoline from pelleted food (1 % ration at 138 ug quinoline/g food) and most tissues reached apparent steady-state after 10 days feeding. Maximum whole-body concentrations of quinoline plus metabolites were only 30 ng/g after 7 days depuration. Uptake rate constants ranged from 0. 00006 /day for muscle to 0. 1455 /day for gallbladder plus bile. Mean elimination half-life for quinoline-derived radioactivity ranged from 0. 4 days in gills to 8. 7 days for muscle. Depending on tissue, 58 - 83 % of the stored radioactivity was present as metabolites. About 14 % of the radioactivity in the bile was present as glucuronide conjugates. Quinoline was absorbed from the stomach by rainbow trout and peak serum levels occurred 4 - 8 hr after a single feeding. Pharmacokinetics were described using a two-compartment body model with first-order absorption and disposition; estimated half-lives for the a and B phase were 4. 1 and 54. 1 hr, respectively. Depending on dose, 71 to 83 % of the ingested radioactivity was excreted during the first 24 hr after feeding. Branchial excretion was the primary route of excretion, all other routes (fecal, biliary, urinary, dermal) contributing 99 % of quinoline was available for absorption. About 60 % of the residual body burden was stored in the gallbladder bile, but bile was retained only in starved fish. There was no evidence for enterohepatic circulation of quinoline or its metabolites following ejection of gallbladder bile. Increased feeding rates enhanced the movement of the food bolus and associated radioactivity through the intestine, but did not affect patterns of tissue disposition...|$|R
40|$|Quantitation of DNA adducts {{in human}} tissues has been {{achieved}} with highly sensitive techniques based on adduct radiolabeling, antisera specific for DNA adducts or modified DNA, and/or adduct structural characterization using chemical instrumentation. Combinations of these approaches now promise to elucidate specific adduct structures and provide detection limits {{in the range of}} 1 adduct/ 10 (9) nucleotides. Documentation of human exposure and biologically effective dose (i. e., chemical bound to DNA) {{has been achieved}} {{for a wide variety of}} chemical carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines, heterocyclic amines, aflatoxins, nitrosamines, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, styrene, and malondialdehyde. Due to difficulties in exposure documentation, dosimetry has not been precise with most environmental and occupational exposures, even though increases in human blood cell DNA adduct levels may correlate approximately with dose. Perhaps more significant are observations that lowering exposure results in decreasing DNA adduct levels. DNA adduct dosimetry for environmental agents has been achieved with <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants.</b> For example, blood cell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adduct levels were shown to correlate with frequency of charbroiled meat consumption in California firefighters. In addition, in China urinary excretion of the aflatoxin B 1 -N 7 -guanine (AFB 1 -N 7 -G) adduct was shown to increase linearly with the aflatoxin content of ingested food. Assessment of DNA adduct formation as an indicator of human cancer risk requires a prospective nested case-control study design. This has been achieved in one investigation of hepatocellular carcinoma and urinary aflatoxin adducts using subjects followed by a Shanghai liver cancer registry. Individuals who excreted the AFB 1 -N 7 -G adduct had a 9. 1 -fold adjusted increased relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma compared to individuals with no adducts. Future advances in this field will be dependent on chemical characterization of specific DNA adducts formed in human tissues, more-precise molecular dosimetry, efforts to correlate DNA adducts with cancer risk, and elucidation of opportunities to reduce human DNA adduct levels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Environmental exposures, {{including}} <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants,</b> {{may influence}} the developing immune system. This study assesses the association between maternal pre-parturition consumption of seafood and wheeze, eczema, and food allergy in preschool children. Fish and shellfish were studied separately as they differ according to their levels of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (which have anti-allergic properties) and their levels of contaminants. METHODS: The PELAGIE cohort included 3421 women recruited {{at the beginning of}} pregnancy. Maternal fish and shellfish intake was measured at inclusion by a food frequency questionnaire. Wheeze, eczema, and food allergy were evaluated by a questionnaire completed by the mother when the child was 2  years old (n[*]=[*] 1500). Examination of the associations between seafood intake and outcomes took major confounders into account. Complementary sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation enabled us to handle missing data, due mostly to attrition. RESULTS: Moderate maternal pre-parturition fish intake (1 to 4 times a month) was, at borderline significance, associated with a lower risk of wheeze (adjusted OR[*]=[*] 0. 69 (0. 45 - 1. 05)) before age 2, compared with low intake (< once/month). This result was not, however, consistent: after multiple imputation, the adjusted OR was 0. 86 (0. 63 - 1. 17). Shellfish intake {{at least once a month}} was associated with a higher risk of food allergy before age 2 (adjusted OR[*]=[*] 1. 62 (1. 11 - 2. 37)) compared to low or no intake (< once/month). Multiple imputation confirmed this association (adjusted OR[*]=[*] 1. 52 (1. 05 - 2. 21)). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that maternal pre-parturition shellfish consumption may increase the risk of food allergy. Further large-scale epidemiologic studies are needed to corroborate these results, identify the contaminants or components of shellfish responsible for the effects observed, determine the persistence of the associations seen at age 2, and investigate potential associations with health effects observable at later ages, such as allergic asthma...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the residues concentrations of pesticides in vegetables, and assessing the health risk {{due to the}} daily consumption of contaminated vegetables for adults in the prominent farming community of Akumadan in Ghana. Fifteen pooled samples, belonging to five vegetable types (tomato, cabbage, pepper, onion and eggplants) purchased from local markets across Ghana were analysed for DDTs, endosulfan, HCHs, methoxychlor, dimethoate and lambda-cyhalothrin using GC-MS. The concentrations of the pesticides ranged from 0. 01 to 46. 95 µg/kg wet weight. Dietary {{data were collected from}} 130 residents. By combining the <b>dietary</b> and <b>contaminant</b> data, <b>dietary</b> exposure to the identified pesticides was calculated. Dietary exposure to pesticide residues at Akumadan is low and there is no associated health risk.

Methyl-mercury is a neurotoxic environmental contaminant, for much fish can be consumed without undue risk from the contaminants.

30|$|Detoxification of {{environmental}} and <b>dietary</b> <b>contaminants,</b> toxic chemicals, and drugs are chiefly outlined as the function of a healthy liver [1]. Hepato-toxicity which is induced by drugs {{is one of the}} pivotal reasons for liver diseases [2]. Acetaminophen as one of the oxidative stress induced-drug commonly used as a palliative medication in different populations. In the liver, cytochrome P 450 metabolizes its therapeutic doses to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine in small amounts. But in overdose status, high levels of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine produces and glutathione depletion happens. This process causes severe damages to the liver and susceptible cells towards oxidative stress [3]. Another drug which is toxic for liver is rifampicin. Rifampicin is a bactericidal antibiotic drug which can cause acute liver diseases. Mechanisms by which rifampicin causes hepato-toxicity have not well been understood; however, it is widely metabolized by the liver and causes the elevation of multiple hepatic enzymes [4, 5]. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} natural products based on antioxidants including; flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic compounds could protect cells and vital molecules from oxidative stress. Therefore, verification of oxidative inhibitory effects of natural products in order to remove free radical intermediates and terminate cellular damages, could give rise to novel therapeutic methods for liver injuries. One of the beneficial herbals attracted much consideration as therapeutic agent is Z.jujuba. Different constituents of this plant are used as immune modulator, tumor suppressor, alleviative, soporific, hypotensive and anti-oxidative agent and as a therapy for insomnia and depression [6 – 9]. In line with Z.jujuba, the hepato-protective features of B.vulgaris have also been determined [10]. B.vulgaris used to treat liver inflammatory and hypertension diseases and also has anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressive functions [11 – 13]. B.vulgaris fruit efficiently scavenged free radicals intermediates. These radicals damage hepatic cells and leads to an increase in liver enzymes. Hence, the antioxidant features of B.vulgaris, diminished the activity of these enzymes. The C.sativus is widely used in Middle Eastern countries like Iran as spice, yellow dye and even a remedy [14]. Experimental investigations suggested that C.sativus has similar medicinal properties to other considered herbs in their studies [15 – 17]. It has been demonstrated that there is an antidepressant effect in its petal which cost plenty less compare to its stigma, so there is growing tendency to use. Therefore, the pharmaceutical properties of this herb caused to use it as new, safe and low-priced component [18]. In the present study, we sought to investigate the protective effects of C.sativus, Z.jujuba and B.vulgaris against acetaminophen and rifampicin-induced acute liver toxicity in rats.|$|R

40|$|Soils {{from urban}} areas often contain {{enhanced}} pseudo-total levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs).

In this study, we have developed a statistical model to describe the population distribution of contaminant exposure and the usual intake of the high-end contaminant consumers. Monte Carlo methods are used to account for variations due to seasonal <b>dietary</b> pattern and <b>contaminant</b> concentrations. Distribution of the dietary intake of the contaminants of most concern-mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordane, and toxaphenes-are described. Over 50 % of the residents had dietary exposure levels exceeding the tolerable daily intake or provisional tolerable daily intake for Hg, toxaphene, and chlordane (83, 91, and 71 % for men and 73, 85, and 56 % for women, respectively). The high-end consumers (i. e. the 95 th centile) have intake levels 6 {{times higher than the}} provisional tolerable weekly intake of Hg, and over 20 times the tolerable daily intake of chlordane and toxaphene. Assessment of health risks of the relative high contaminant exposure in this community must also consider the nutritional, economical, cultural, and social importance of these traditional foods.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} regional contamination versus dietary differences to geographic variation in polar bear (Ursus maritimus) contaminant levels is unknown. Dietary variation between Alaska, Canada, East Greenland, and Svalbard subpopulations {{was assessed by}} muscle nitrogen and carbon stable isotope (d 15 N, d 13 C) and adipose fatty acid (FA) signatures relative to their main prey (ringed seals). Western and southern Hudson Bay signatures were characterized by depleted d 15 N and d 13 C, lower proportions of C 20 and C 22 monounsaturated FAs and higher proportions of C 18 and longer chain polyunsaturated FAs. East Greenland and Svalbard signatures were reversed relative to Hudson Bay. Alaskan and Canadian Arctic signatures were intermediate. Between-subpopulation dietary differences predominated over interannual, seasonal, sex, or age variation. Among various brominated and chlorinated contaminants, diet signatures significantly explained variation in adipose levels of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (14 - 15 %) and legacy PCBs (18 - 21 %). However, <b>dietary</b> influence was <b>contaminant</b> class-specific, since only low or nonsignificant proportions of variation in organochlorine pesticide (e. g., chlordane) levels were explained by diet. Hudson Bay diet signatures were associated with lower PCB and PBDE levels, whereas East Greenland and Svalbard signatures were associated with higher levels.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} was to obtain data on the {{exposure}} of non-breast-fed infants to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides (OCP), and Bisphenol A (BPA) and its chlorinated derivatives through consumption of commercial infant foods with largest shares of the market in 22 EU countries. The E-Screen bioassay was employed to assess the estrogenicity of the baby foods and the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction was measured to determine the levels of PCDD/F and PCB. Consequently, the highest total effective xenoestrogen burden (TEXB) value of 73. 60 pM Eeq/g was found in the soy-based formula and the EROD-bioassay was always below the LOQ (3. 5 pg/g). Overall, the estimated dietary exposure to BPA via commercial baby foods was lower than the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 50 µg/kg body weight (bw). Furthermore, our findings indicated that the dietary exposure of 0 - 9 -month-old infants through the products investigated here does not exceed the maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 4 pg WHO-TEQ (toxic equivalents) /kg bw. However, exposure to more than 2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw/day might occur for 0 - 4 month of age infants consuming "starting" hypoallergenic formula. Moreover, analysis of OCP indicated that the dietary exposure of non-breast-fed infants was not harmful.

40|$|International audienceAs first {{described}} in the 1980 s, the core food intake model allows a precise assessment of dietary nutrient intake and <b>dietary</b> exposure to <b>contaminants</b> insofar as it reflects the eating habits of a target population and covers the most important foods in term of consumption, selected nutrient and contaminant contribution. This model {{has been used to}} set up the sampling strategy of the second French Total Diet Study (TDS) which aims to obtain a realistic panorama of nutrient intakes and contaminant exposure for the whole population, useful for quantitative risk assessment. Data on consumption trends and eating habits from the second French individual food consumption survey (INCA 2) as well as data from a 2004 purchase panel of French households (SECODIP) were used to identify the core foods to be sampled. 116 core foods on a national scale and 70 core foods on a regional scale were selected according to (i) the consumption data for adults and children, (ii) their consumer rates, and (iii) their high contribution to exposure to one or more contaminants of interest. Foods were collected in 8 French regions (36 cities) and prepared “as-consumed” to be analysed for their nutritional composition and contamination levels. 20, 280 different food products were purchased to make up the 1, 352 composite samples of core foods to be analysed for additives, environmental contaminants, pesticide residues, trace elements and minerals, mycotoxins and acrylamid.

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of acute and chronic <b>dietary</b> exposure to <b>contaminants</b> in baby foods {{is needed to}} ensure healthy infant growth. Monthly EU market baskets of commercial baby foods were designed for the first 9 months of life by the "babyfood" study group of the CASCADE Network of Excellence for the specific purpose of assessing exposure to potentially toxic substances in infants fed with such foods. The present paper reports the different steps {{that led to the}} preparation of monthly pooled samples of commercial baby foods ("Infant formulae and follow-on formulae", and "Other baby foods") that may constitute the extreme case of the diet for an infant that would not be breast fed at all. Several market baskets were generated for an "average EU infant" and for infants of 4 selected countries (Italy, Sweden, Spain and Slovakia), fed with either milk infant formulae, soy infant formulae or hypoallergenic infant formulae and weaned (at the 5 th month) with commercial baby foods and beverages available on the EU market. Market share data of 2007 for baby foods were used to design the baskets. Holding companies and the name of all their products were identified. Monthly diets for EU infants were elaborated in terms of food categories (e. g. infant cereals) of typologies of products (e. g. infant cereals without gluten) and of specific product. The number of baskets generated was 30 for "Infant formulae and follow-on formulae" (including 62 products) and 13 for "Other baby foods" (including 35 products).
