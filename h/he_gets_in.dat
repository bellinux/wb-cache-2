5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E
25|$|Mamoru {{struggles with}} his {{identity}} and function throughout the series, worrying first about his true nature, then later whether <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> {{the way of}} the Sailor Soldiers. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.|$|E

25|$|His {{philosophy}} towards batting is {{summarized by}} an all-aggression approach {{and over the}} years he has dominated almost every one day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at rapid pace once <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in,</b> he holds the record for the second highest number of one day centuries and has scored the second most 150+ scores (4 scores) (Sachin Tendulkar has the most 150+ scores at 5). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka have won almost 80% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited overs cricket. When asked in an interview who are the most challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order Wasim Akram, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose.|$|E

However, once he meets up with Squidward, he says that he cannot play in the concert because the reed of his clarinet is [...] "shot". Determined not to miss out on this activity as he had done with the other ones, SpongeBob pulls out one of his teeth to replace the reed. SpongeBob attempts to enter the building, but the usher refuses to let him in unless he has a ticket. He tries various methods of sneaking in, but at last he is let in because he is on the VIP list (Mrs. Puff had said his name in one of his attempts). <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> right as the concert ends.|$|E
500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Unterberger of {{the website}} PopDust wrote that Flo Rida was [...] "exactly" [...] what the {{original}} version of [...] "We Found Love" [...] was missing. He added, [...] "No Rihanna, you got it backwards—it's Flo Rida who needs to have other, more talented people on his songs in order {{to turn them into}} hits, not the other way around... At least this remix does feature a sizeable contribution from Flo, as he shows up on both the intro and over the song's primary instrumental hook with his trademark unintelligble yammering, though <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> at least one reference to rocking a party 'like I'm Mick Jagger.'" [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone praised the remix of the song, saying that [...] "once again, Flo Rida shows his true rapping skills over the beat of Rihanna's 'We Found Love'". Both Billboards Erika Ramirez and Spins Marc Hogan praised the remixed version calling it [...] "refreshing" [...] and [...] "interesting". However, Becky Bain of the website Idolator was more negative towards the remix. She noted, [...] "Being that Rihanna's 'We Found Love' has enough beats and synths to be its own remix, not to mention it couldn't possibly be even more popular on the Hot 100... we find it pointless to release {{a new version of the}} single with Flo Rida." ...|$|E
