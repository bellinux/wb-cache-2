5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from}} that of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characters}} of the novella, Selver, Lyubov, and Davidson, have been described by reviewers as representing three different historical attitudes towards nature. Davidson represent the machismo of some early explorers, who feared nature and wanted to overcome it. Lyubov has a more positive but highly romanticized view of the forest, while only Selver and the other Athsheans are able to live in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|E

5|$|In 2154, {{humans have}} {{depleted}} Earth's natural resources, {{leading to a}} severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — unobtanium — on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, a species of , blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> the paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.|$|E

He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> the nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter}} of the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

5|$|Though Parry {{had a great}} {{interest}} in music, he had no opportunity to study it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready Iron Works.

He continued to study <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E

It asserts that those in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> other Christians.|$|E
5|$|When Constantine {{returned}} to Trinidad in late 1954, {{he found a}} growing desire for independence from Britain. At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other, mainly white, senior staff; this drew him towards political involvement. Eric Williams, leader of the newly founded People's National Movement (PNM), was aware of Constantine's popular appeal and recruited him. By January 1956 Constantine, with the full co-operation and blessing of his employers, was party chairman {{and a member of}} its executive committee. Feeling that the PNM's policies were in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> his views on improving the lives of black people, and encouraged by his wife, Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of Tunapuna in 1956. He won a narrow victory, which his colleagues believed few in the party could have done, and resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds. The PNM formed a government, in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications, Works and Utilities.|$|E

5|$|Between 1930 and 1936, Kolbe {{undertook}} {{a series of}} missions to East Asia. At first, he arrived in Shanghai, China, but failed to gather a following there. Next, he moved to Japan, where by 1931 he founded a monastery at the outskirts of Nagasaki (it later gained a novitiate and a seminary) and started publishing a Japanese edition of the Knight of the Immaculate (Seibo no Kishi). The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan. Kolbe built the monastery on a mountainside that, according to Shinto beliefs, was not the side best suited to be in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> nature. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, Kolbe's monastery was saved because {{the other side of}} the mountain took the main force of the blast. In mid-1932 he left Japan for Malabar, India, where he founded another monastery; this one however closed after a while. Meanwhile, the monastery at Niepokalanów began in his absence to publish the daily newspaper, Mały Dziennik (The Little Daily), in alliance with the political group, the National Radical Camp (Obóz Narodowo Radykalny). This publication reached a circulation of 137,000, and nearly double that, 225,000, on weekends.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm {{approached}} the filmmaker {{to ask if}} he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The book, about a Goldi hunter who lives in <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
