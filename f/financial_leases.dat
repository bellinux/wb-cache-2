40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{closed form}} solutions to price secured bank loans and <b>financial</b> <b>leases</b> subject to default risk. Secured debt fair credit spreads always {{increase in the}} debtor's default probability, whereas financial leasing fair credit spreads may well decrease in the lessee's default probability and even be negative. The {{reason is that the}} lessor, unlike the secured lender, can gain from the lessee's default, especially when the leasing contract envisages initial prepayments or the lessee's terminal options to either purchase the leased asset or to extend the lease maturity. This result, which critically depends on contractual and bankruptcy code provisions, can explain some of the empirical evidence and the use of <b>financial</b> <b>leases</b> as an alternative to secured bank lending to finance small, risky and relatively opaque firms. ...|$|E

An estimation of the development of the number of leasing companies in Ukraine is made. It is established that the number of legal entities - lessors remains almost unchanged, but financial companies that provide <b>financial</b> <b>leasing</b> services are rapidly developing. It is substantiated that financial companies providing <b>financial</b> <b>leasing</b> services as universal institutions provide a wider range of financial services in crisis conditions; it serves as the basis for the growth of their number.

40|$|In 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in {{cooperation}} with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), will issue a new proposal to change the current accounting regulation with respect to leasing to an alternative approach. This new lease-accounting approach, called the “asset and liability approach”, capitalises all leases on the balance sheet. This contrasts with the current lease-accounting approach, called the “risk and reward approach”, which discriminates between the recognition of <b>financial</b> <b>leases</b> on the balance sheet and the disclosure of operating leases off the balance sheet. As with the current risk and reward approach, also the asset and liability approach has many opponents. This study investigates: - what the impact on financial ratios might be when operating leases are capitalised on the balance sheet, - what company characteristics determines the choice for operating leases, and - whether financially-distressed companies use more operating leases than healthy companies. The results show that operating leases have become a major financing source, which is not only attributable to the accounting treatment of operating leases. However, the information on operating leases as required in the footnotes to the financial statements is not transparent, nor reliable. The current lease-accounting standards might be maintained but improved, and this could be an intermediate solution that is acceptable for the proponents of both lease-accounting approaches...|$|E

The possibility of adjusting to the current needs is of a significant practical value, {{but at the same}} time it poses a substantial difficulty in defining the constituent features of a <b>financial</b> <b>lease.</b> In order to understand its essence, two related instruments were taken as a point of reference: a lease and a rental.
