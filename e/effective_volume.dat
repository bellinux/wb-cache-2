50|$|The {{loudspeaker}} driver's {{moving mass}} and compliance (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's resonant frequency (Fs). In {{combination with the}} damping properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (Fc), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position {{in the absence of}} a signal. A significant increase in the <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air. The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow pressure equalisation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{equation}} of state previously developed for binary mixtures of hard spheres and hard diatomic molecules is extended to athermal binary mixtures of diatomic and linear triatomic molecules. The theory obtains the excess compressibility factor of the mixture by scaling the excess compressibility factor of a reference mixture of hard spheres. Spheres of species i in the reference mixture must have a molecular volume equal to the <b>effective</b> molecular <b>volume</b> of species i in the true mixture. This <b>effective</b> molecular <b>volume</b> is introduced {{to account for the}} fact that the excluded volume of a nonconvex molecule is greater than its real volume. The theory requires two parameters, namely the <b>effective</b> molecular <b>volume</b> of the mixture and the scaling parameter. Both can be derived from the geometry of the molecules which form the mixture. Results are in good agreement with simulation data. ...|$|R

5000|$|All the {{everyday}} objects {{that we can}} bump into, touch or squeezeare ultimately composed of atoms. This ordinary atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles—usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons. Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered [...] "point particles" [...] with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up [...] "ordinary matter", and their interactions contribute to the <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.|$|E

Proponents of this method argue that {{it makes it easier}} for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the Venetian polychoral style). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in Benjamin Britten's War Requiem.

40|$|This work {{presents}} and evaluates a new method, based upon tracer gas techniques, for determining interzonal airflows and <b>effective</b> <b>volumes</b> in a multizone enclosure. Presently used tracer gas techniques {{have a number}} of drawbacks including the need for multiple tracers when analyzing a multizone structure. The proposed method uses a single tracer gas to disturb the zones. A state-space formulation is used to model the multizone system. The concentration data are used in combination with a recursive least-squares identification algorithm to determine all of the interzonal airflows and <b>effective</b> <b>volumes.</b> A number of simulations are then used to evaluate the method. The simulations show that there are important considerations when selecting the type of input applied to each zone. They also indicate that the proper choice of sampling interval is critical for accurate identification. A three-zone experimental test facility was also constructed to validate the simulation results as well as test the identification algorithms under more realistic conditions. The results indicate that the single gas tracer technique was able to estimate the interzonal airflows and <b>effective</b> <b>volumes</b> of the experimental facility to within 10 %, in most cases. Three methods are proposed and evaluated for analyzing systems in which non-ideal mixing of the tracer inputs occur. The method of choice in most cases is to compensate for inadequate mixing by varying the sampling interval. However, the time constants of the system limit the maximum sampling interval. A second method is zone subdivision. This method suffers from the drawbacks of requiring additional tests and equipment. The third method is to alter the system model to include non-ideal mixing. The injection cell modelling technique is proposed for cases where sampling interval compensation and zone subdivision are not appropriate. The injection cell technique divides each zone into two cells-an injection cell and a detection cell. This modelling technique permits estimation of airflows and total volumes in cases where the tracer inputs mix slowly, relative to the time constants of the system. Ope...|$|R

In the present study {{the concept of a}} reduced <b>effective</b> plasma <b>volume</b> in cirrhosis is challenged by two lines of evidence, even though <b>effective</b> plasma <b>volume</b> itself could not be measured. (a) Total plasma volume failed to rise in 10 patients with the spontaneous loss of ascites, the appearance of sodium in the urine, and a rise in GFR.

This study introduces a new method {{to estimate the}} <b>effective</b> fracture <b>volume</b> in shale gas wells using water production data instead of the hydrocarbon production data. The main objective {{of this study is}} to verify and improve Alkouh?s method of estimating the <b>effective</b> fracture <b>volume</b> using water production data through testing it at different reservoir conditions. For this purpose, several simulation cases were run. The results of the simulation runs were compared with the production data from several Fayetteville gas wells. Different conclusions were obtained from these comparisons that emphasize the importance of using water production data in the production data analysis. A better evaluation for fracture-stimulation jobs can be acquired through the estimation of the <b>effective</b> fracture <b>volume</b> from early water production data. The main outcome of this study is a new method (modification ofAlkouh?s method) for analyzing water production data in shale gas wells.
