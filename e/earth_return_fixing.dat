50|$|Single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> (SWER) {{or single}} wire ground return is a single-wire {{transmission}} line for supplying single-phase electrical power for an electrical grid to remote areas at low cost. It is principally used for rural electrification, but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. Single wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> is also used for HVDC over submarine power cables.|$|R

40|$|Ascent, {{rendezvous}} and <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> {{are three}} operational mission sequences {{in the sample}} return phase of the Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) mission. In {{the conduct of the}} current study, several vehicles have been identified to enable the sample return phase of the mission. These elements are the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle (ERV), the rendezvous and docking module (RDM), and the sample return capsule (SRC). The sample return elements, when combined with other elements performing the launch and delivery functions, form the basis of the MRSR system. This paper summarizes the significant mission aspects of the sample return phase, describes the Mars ascent and <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> scenario, illustrates the conceptual designs developed for the MAV, ERV, RDM, and SRC, and discusses the results of significant trade studies conducted...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of a Mars sample return {{mission is to}} bring selected Mars surface materials to Earth. Numerous approaches for the Earth-return segment have been analyzed including propulsive or aerocapture return to low-Earth orbit followed by Space Shuttle rendezvous and direct entry. Of these approaches, ballistic entry of a small capsule terminating in a ground landing {{has been shown to}} be the lowest risk strategy. Over the past two years, significant work has been performed towards development of a robust direct entry vehicle for Mars sample return. In June 1999, the NASA Planetary Protection Officer provided initial guidance to the former Mars Sample Return Project. The sample return phase of the mission was assigned a restricted <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> planetary protection classification. The draft mission requirement states that the total mean probability of release of unsterilized Mars material into the Earth;s biosphere must be less than 1. 0 E- 06 (1 in a million). This strict requirement drives the approach and design of the <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system. To meet this requirement, selection of the <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> strategy and development of the <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system must be guided by risk, not performance, based decisions. An initial Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was performed to address the direct entry <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system containment assurance reliability and to identify high-risk elements of this system. The results of this PRA identified risk elements that include thermal protection system performance during entry, spin-eject orientation and aerodynamic stability during entry, structural integrity under atmospheric deceleration and impact loads, and tracking/recovery of this system. This initial probabilistic risk quantification demonstrates that, with the proper development program, a prototypical direct entry design can satisfy the containment assurance reliability requirement. Through the current Mars Sample Return Advanced Technology Development effort, an extensive design, analysis, and test program is presently proceeding with the aim of reducing the containment assurance risk of this system. This technology development effort, guided by a continuing PRA, focuses on key risk areas of a direct entry <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system including: the thermal protection system, impact dynamics, structural performance, aerodynamic stability, and ground recovery. This development program will culminate in a system validation flight test, 1 - 2 years prior to launch of the flight system. This flight test would include the launch, entry, and recovery of a full-scale <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system, as a scientific validation of the key risk elements to verify nominal design performance. The results of the initial PRA suggested several dominant failure sequences that can be validated in a flight test. These include: demonstrating the thermal protection system reliability and performance during entry, demonstrating the spin-eject orientation and aero-dynamic stability during entry, demonstrating the structural integrity under atmospheric deceleration and impact loads, and demonstrating tracking and recovery of the <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system. This single test will directly address over 50 % of the total containment assurance risk elements. This presentation will begin by presenting the relative risk of various <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> strategies. The results of the initial probabilistic risk assessment will be presented followed by a discussion of the development accomplishments and plans for demonstration of a highly reliable direct entry <b>Earth</b> <b>return</b> system...|$|R

50|$|Rural {{services}} normally try {{to minimize}} the number of poles and wires. Single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> (SWER) is the least expensive, with one wire. It uses higher voltages (than urban distribution), which in turn permits use of galvanized steel wire. The strong steel wire allows for less expensive wide pole spacing. In rural areas a pole-mount transformer may serve only one customer. In New Zealand, Australia, Saskatchewan, Canada, and South Africa, single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> systems (SWER) are used to electrify remote rural areas.|$|R

40|$|Mars Sample Return is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the 2011 Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This article presents the results of a feasibility study for a Mars Sample Return mission that efficiently uses emerging commercial capabilities expected to be available in the near future. The motivation of our study was the recognition that emerging commercial capabilities might be used to perform Mars Sample Return with an Earth-direct architecture, and that this may offer a desirable simpler and lower cost approach. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether these capabilities can be used to optimize the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of achieving the desired simplicity. All of the major element required for the Mars Sample Return mission are described. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships. The analysis shows the feasibility of a complete and closed Mars Sample Return mission design based on the following scenario: A SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicle places a modified version of a SpaceX Dragon capsule, referred to as "Red Dragon", onto a Trans Mars Injection trajectory. The capsule carries all the hardware needed to <b>return</b> to <b>Earth</b> Orbit samples collected by a prior mission, such as the planned NASA Mars 2020 sample collection rover. The payload includes a fully fueled Mars Ascent Vehicle; a fueled <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle, support equipment, and a mechanism to transfer samples from the sample cache system onboard the rover to the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retropropulsion. After collected samples are transferred to the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle, the single-stage Mars Ascent Vehicle launches the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. After a brief phasing period, the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle performs a Trans Earth Injection burn. Once near <b>Earth,</b> the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle performs <b>Earth</b> and lunar swing-bys and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A retrieval mission then performs a rendezvous with the <b>Earth</b> <b>Return</b> Vehicle, retrieves the sample container, and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere. The mission can start in any one of three Earth to Mars launch opportunities, beginning in 2022...|$|R
