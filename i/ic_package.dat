40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to present the Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS) {{methodology}} to improving the classification accuracy for <b>IC</b> <b>Packaging</b> Product Database. The selection of proper packaging and manufacturing procedures is one of the priorities in IC design operations. Separation of industrial production characteristics require that IC designers have to ask the <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> engineers down the supply chain to confirm information regarding related product information, such as <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> type, size, functional features and price before they can select <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> products and determine IC product design procedures. In response to these product information demands from IC designers, service staffs of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> factories integrate information from various departments to provide feedback to the designers. However, as the related information is very complex and professional, precious time is wasted during their communications, which instigates a failure to meet the demand of quick response. Furthermore, the IC product design and development cost and timing may be affected by lack of information. In an age of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> technological breakthroughs, <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> structure and technological capabilities have already become key stages of IC design and manufacturing processes. Hence, it has become a very significant topic of the design industry, to effectively and rapidly, obtain ample product related information of <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> to meet their operational demands and enable them to improve operational costs and shorten processes. The present study adopts the VPRS method, an improved rough set theory to be applied to classification accuracy of the <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> product database; then compare the highest accuracy values with the values and rules obtained from the Johnson rough algorithm. The experimental results prove that proper β values, based on VPRS, are able to improve <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> product classification accuracy to obtain more consistent values and simpler rules regarding maximum value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMC/SI/PI {{problems}} have been broadly attested. But <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMI was seldom addressed. Because the EMI emission by IC packagings is increasingly significant, in this paper, EMI behaviors are systematically studied. To fundamentally understand the radiation mechanism, radiated contributions from ground lids, vias, and traces of the packaging are investigated and modeled separately. It is seen that the packaging EMI has clearly low frequency and high frequency behaviors. The low frequency behavior {{is due to the}} Hertzian dipole effects of vias. The high frequency behavior is due to the radiation of excited cavity modes. Both theoretical analysis based on first principles and simulated results based on the numerical full wave solver are provided to find out critical impact factors to <b>IC</b> <b>packaging</b> EMI. This work provides basic modeling components for comprehensive radiation studies in the future. It directly benefits fundamental understandings and guidelines for the optimal design of the packaging EMI reduction.
