5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron <b>degeneracy</b> pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} <b>degeneracy</b> pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus.

This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E

40|$|In Kohn-Sham density {{functional}} theory (KS-DFT) {{a fictitious}} system of non-interacting particles is constructed {{having the same}} ground-state (GS) density as the physical system of interest. A fundamental open question in DFT concerns the ability of an exact KS calculation to spot and characterize the GS <b>degeneracies</b> in the physical system. In this article we provide theoretical evidence suggesting that the GS density, {{as a function of}} position on a 2 D manifold of parameters affecting the external potential, is "topologically scarred" in a distinct way by <b>degeneracies.</b> These scars are sufficiently detailed to enable determination of the positions of <b>degeneracies</b> and even the associated Berry phases.

5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron <b>degeneracy</b> pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by <b>degeneracy</b> pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, <b>degeneracy</b> pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E

Furthermore, we determine the BPS <b>degeneracies</b> encoded in augmentation polynomials and show their consistency with known colored HOMFLY polynomials. Finally, we consider refined BPS <b>degeneracies</b> for knots, determine them from the knowledge of super-A-polynomials, and verify their integrality.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>degeneracies</b> among several cosmological {{parameters}} in detail and discuss their {{impacts on the}} determinations of these parameters from the current and future observations. By combining the latest data sets, including type-Ia supernovae "Union 2. 1 " compilation, WMAP seven-year data and the baryon acoustic oscillations from the SDSS Data Release Seven, we perform a global analysis to determine the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy w, the curvature of the universe Ω_k, the total neutrino mass ∑m_ν, and the parameters associated with the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations (n_s, α_s and r). We pay particular attention on the <b>degeneracies</b> among these parameters and the influences on their constraints, by with or without including these <b>degeneracies,</b> respectively. We find that w and Ω_k or ∑m_ν are strongly correlated. Including the <b>degeneracies</b> will significantly weaken the constraints. Furthermore, we study the capabilities of future observations and find these <b>degeneracies</b> can be broken very well. Consequently, the constraints of cosmological parameters can be improved dramatically. Comment: 9 figures, 6 tables, Accepted for publication in JCA...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} <b>degeneracies</b> of 4 D and 5 D BPS black holes in {{toroidal}} compactifications of M-theory or type II string theory, using U-duality as a tool. We generalize the 4 D- 5 D lift {{to include all}} charges in = 8 supergravity, and compute the exact indexed <b>degeneracies</b> of certain 4 D 1 / 8 -BPS black holes. Using the attractor formalism, we obtain the leading micro-canonical entropy for arbitrary Legendre invariant prepotentials and non-vanishing D 6 -brane charge. In particular, {{we find that the}} = 8 prepotential is given to leading order by the cubic invariant of E_ 6. This suggests that the minimal unitary representation of E_ 8, based on the same cubic prepotential, underlies the microscopic <b>degeneracies</b> of = 8 black holes. We propose that the exact <b>degeneracies,</b> at fixed 4 -dimensional angular momentum, are given by the Wigner function of the E_ 8 () invariant vector in this automorphic representation.

5|$|The {{interior}} of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent carbon burning, {{it may have}} a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by electron <b>degeneracy</b> pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron <b>degeneracy</b> pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements {{that have an}} atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The <b>degeneracy</b> pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter {{the force of gravity}} and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E

5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , <b>degeneracy</b> {{pressure}} {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses {{toward the center of the}} star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E

However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' <b>degeneracy</b> and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron <b>degeneracy</b> pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E

5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by <b>degeneracy</b> pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
