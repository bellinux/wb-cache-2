It was Paint Branch's third year of varsity football, and their first two campaigns had ended with 3–7 records. About the move, Lester said, [...] "I spent too long treating college players nice and making sure they were happy... I don't have to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> I can coach here. If they want to quit, fine."In 1975, he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship.|$|E
2500|$|Wurzelbacher {{spoke to}} Katie Couric of CBS Evening News on October 15, {{shortly after the}} {{conclusion}} of the final debate. Asked whether Obama's proposed $250,000 tax threshold would affect him, Wurzelbacher replied: [...] "Not right now at presently, but (...) he's going to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> for people who make $250,000 a year. When's he going to decide that $100,000 is too much? (...) You're on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that $250,000 and you're rich? And $100,000 and you're rich? (...) Where does it end?" [...] He also said: [...] "I asked the question but I still got a tap dance...almost as good as Sammy Davis, Jr." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Ryan's wife Morah, {{from whom}} he later separated, telephoned her husband's show and, under the name Norah, told half a million {{listeners}} that her husband dumps his underpants on the floor before hopping into bed every night, doesn't put his clothes on hangers, had not cleaned the dog's mess from the back yard for weeks and never puts the rubbish out for the dustbin men. When she was done she asked her husband: [...] "You would <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> wouldn't you Gerry?" [...] The interview was nearing its finish when he realised what was happening after hearing his crew laughing in the Montrose control room. An embarrassed Ryan informed his listeners: [...] "This is my wife talking".|$|E

2500|$|Following protests {{angry about}} the death of Tara, Whedon and the writing team made a {{decision}} to keep Willow gay. In 2002, he told The Advocate about the possibility of Willow having a relationship with a man, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> and we will be burned alive. And possibly justifiably. We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, I can go back to cock!' Willow {{is not going to be}} straddling that particular fence. She will just be gay." [...] Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode [...] "The Killer in Me", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not understand the value of magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much harder to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> ... If I was {{going to write a}} protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It’s not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone’s mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a topical}} 1973 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives {{with her first}} husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal {{abortion}} aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline {{as a way to}} prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. [...] "Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> you would perhaps hurt your character," [...] said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because [...] "the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb." [...] The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, [...] "Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is one of my best friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining." [...] In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced {{to decide whether or not}} to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. [...] "The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice," [...] said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would [...] "haunt" [...] Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.|$|E

5000|$|Cale often {{acted as}} his own producer/engineer/session player. His vocals, {{sometimes}} whispery, would be buried in the mix. He attributed his unique sound to being a recording mixer and engineer, saying, [...] "Because of all the technology now you can make music yourself {{and a lot of}} people are <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> I started out <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> a long time ago and I found when I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> I came up with a unique sound." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{to sending}} Amy to her, {{there was no}} <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> for, {{as she had been}} servant in the house, she knew Amy as well as Amy knew me; and no doubt, though I was much out of her sight, yet she might have had the curiosity to have peeped at me, and seen me enough to know me again if I had {{discovered}} myself to her; so that, in short, {{there was nothing to be}} <b>done</b> <b>that</b> way.|$|R
