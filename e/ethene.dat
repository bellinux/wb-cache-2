25|$|The chief use of ethane is the {{production}} of <b>ethene</b> (ethylene) by steam cracking. When diluted with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (900nbsp&°C or more), heavy hydrocarbons break down into lighter hydrocarbons, and saturated hydrocarbons become unsaturated. Ethane is favored for <b>ethene</b> production because the steam cracking of ethane is fairly selective for <b>ethene,</b> while the steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons yields a product mixture poorer in <b>ethene</b> and richer in heavier alkenes (olefins), such as propene (propylene) and butadiene, and in aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E

The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> was at Kelly Air Force Base, TX.

40|$|Chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> {{are among}} the most {{frequently}} detected groundwater contaminants in industrially developed countries. Although their degradation pathways have been understood, assessing the progress of natural attenuation of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> still remains a challenge. This thesis explored the possibilities and limits of the use of compound-specific stable isotope analysis as a field investigation tool to document and to quantify the progress of natural attenuation of chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> The thesis focused particularly on the fate of reductive dechlorination intermediates such as cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) as the success of natural attenuation of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> depends principally on the fate of these compounds. Two field investigations were carried out to demonstrate the use of stable isotope analysis to characterize the progress of natural attenuation of chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> One site was characterized as a complex hydrological and geochemical system at the groundwater-surface water interface where a tetrachloroethene- (PCE) plume discharged through the streambed. Another site was located under relatively stable hydrological conditions and characterized by a 2 -km long plume of chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> Laboratory studies evaluated the use of combined carbon and chlorine isotope analysis to distinguish different degradation pathways of cDCE and VC, and the same approach was employed at a field site to determine the fate of cDCE. Numerical studies evaluated the field applicability of isotope-based quantification, according to the Rayleigh isotope fractionation model, to estimate the extent of degradation and the first-order reaction rate under various flow conditions. In addition, a scheme to quantify the reductive dechlorination rates of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> based on field concentration and isotope data at one of the field sites was proposed and evaluated with a series of 3 D analytical solutions to accommodate sequential reactions. The studies demonstrated that stable carbon analysis is a robust and sensitive tool to identify the progress of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> as well as the possibility of other degradation pathways of intermediate compounds even under geochemically and hydrologically complex conditions and even if only a small level of degradation occurs. Although carbon isotope analysis alone can not conclusively determine the fate of degradation intermediates such as cDCE and VC, the use of combined chlorine and carbon isotope analysis can assist in elucidating their fate at field scales. Furthermore, based on the field isotope data, it is possible to estimate the degradation rate even for a complex reaction series such as sequential reductive dechlorination of chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> And the accuracy of the rate quantification increases with increased knowledge of local flow conditions...|$|R

25|$|A major {{industrial}} application for copper(II) chloride is as a co-catalyst with palladium(II) chloride in the Wacker process. In this process, <b>ethene</b> (ethylene) {{is converted to}} ethanal (acetaldehyde) using water and air.

Acceptable contaminants include N2, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{changes in}} the {{transcriptional}} expression of the tceA gene, which encodes a trichloroethene reductive dehalogenase, were characterized in a Dehalococcoides-containing microbial enrichment culture. Expression was quantified by real-time PCR {{as the number of}} tceA transcripts per tceA gene. Expression of tceA increased 40 -fold after chlorinated ethene-starved cells were exposed to trichloroethene (TCE), cis-dichloroethene (DCE), or 1, 1 -DCE but did not increase after exposure to tetrachloroethene or vinyl chloride. Surprisingly, tceA expression also increased 30 -fold after cellular exposure to the nonmetabolic substrate trans-DCE, indicating that expression of tceA is induced by both growth-supporting and non-growth-supporting chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> Additional experiments revealed that the level of tceA expression was independent of the concentration of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> (sum concentrations of TCE and DCEs of 2. 2 to 333 �M), the concentration of the electron donor hydrogen (concentrations of 12 nM to 17 �M), and the presence of alternate bacterial electron acceptors (5 mM concentrations of fumarate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, nitrate, or nitrite) but was highly dependent on incubation temperature.

A comparison {{of the loss of}} viability with the decrease in transformation rates showed that for the monooxygenase-mediated transformation of all chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> except vinyl chloride the decrease in cell viability was the predominant toxic effect. Improper disposal of perchloroethene and trichloroethene (TCE) has frequently caused contamination of groundwater. Dechlorination reactions occurring in situ under anaerobic conditions have resulted at many sites in the generation of cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis- 1, 2 -DCE) and the suspected carcin-ogen vinyl chloride (VC) (8, 28). Methanotrophic bacteria, which oxidize chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> to the corresponding ep-oxides, are good candidates for the treatment of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> (1, 6, 13, 15, 17, 19 – 21, 25 – 27). The epoxides formed are electrophilic compounds that are unstable in aqueous solutions, and they may undergo a variety of secondary reactions, such as hydrolysis, rearrange-ment, or carbon-carbon bond cleavage.

Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E

40|$|Bioremediation of {{chlorinated}} <b>ethenes</b> by the augmentation {{of contaminated}} soils with microorganisms is a proposed method of reducing contaminant concentrations in groundwater. To determine {{the viability of}} using ELW- 1 or R. rhodochrous for groundwater remediation, kinetic analyses of transformation rates must be performed. The focus {{of this research was}} to determine: 1) the specific rates of contaminant transformation when ELW- 1 was exposed to chlorinated <b>ethenes,</b> 2) if R. rhodochrous has the ability to transform chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> and ethanes and 3) kinetic parameters of cometabolic processes using a modified Monod model to account for decrease in cell activity over time. Degradation rates for ELW- 1 include 5. 1 μmol/mg TSS-d for vinyl chloride (VC), 0. 2 μmol/mg TSS-d for cis-Dichloroethene (c-DCE), and 4. 1 μmol/mg TSS-d for trichloroethene (TCE).

40|$|Many {{remediation}} {{technologies have}} been developed to treat extensive subsurface contamination by chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs). One such technology is a permeable reactive barrier (PRB), which contains reactive media that acts as an electron donor in order to reduce CHCs. Extensive effort has been placed on finding the most suitable reactive media in PRBs, with zero-valent iron (ZVI) being the most commonly utilized media. However, zero-valent zinc (ZVZ) is a promising replacement for ZVI in PRBs as it will more readily donate electrons, resulting in more rapid degradation of CHCs. In addition, amending a secondary/catalytic metal to primary metal surface can result in increased degradation kinetics and yield of dechlorinated byproducts. In this investigation, chlorinated methanes (CF and DCM), ethanes (1, 1, 2, 2 -TeCA, 1, 1, 2 -TCA, 1, 1, 1 -TCA, and 1, 2 -DCA), <b>ethenes</b> (PCE, TCE, cis-DCE, trans-DCE, and VC) and propanes (1, 2, 3 -TCP and 1, 2 -DCP) were reduced by ZVZ and Zn bimetallic reductants. Results indicated that Cu/Zn was a more potent bimetallic reductant than Pd/Zn and Ni/Zn due to impressive CF degradation kinetics and increased yield of methane formed via direct transformation of CF to methane. Cu/Zn was used in reduction of all other compounds and did not significantly change byproduct distributions when compared to ZVZ. Reductive β-elimination was an important degradation pathway observed for chlorinated ethanes and <b>ethenes,</b> with reduction of chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> via this pathway resulting in the formation of highly reactive chlorinated acetylene intermediates, thus preventing the formation of VC. It appears that ZVI will reduce chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> via reductive β-elimination more readily than Zn reductants, suggesting an advantage of ZVI in the reduction of chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> However, Zn reductants appear to be well suited for PRB applications at sites contaminated with 1, 2, 3 -TCP, as reduction with Zn reductants yields fully dechlorinated byproducts via a reductive β-elimination to hydrogenolysis sequence, unlike ZVI. Cu/Zn increased degradation kinetics compared to ZVZ for all CHCs investigated, but only slight enhancement in kinetics was observed for chlorinated propanes. Increased chlorinated methane, ethane, and propane kinetics have been reported with ZVZ when compared to ZVI, thus suggesting the need to further study Cu/Zn as a potential replacement for ZVI in PRB applications...|$|R

25|$|<b>Ethene,</b> however, has no {{permanent}} dipole. The attractive forces between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der Waals forces.

Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA methodological {{approach}} is described which combines geophysical and geochemical data to delineate {{the extent of}} a chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> plume in northern France; the methodology was used to calibrate a hydrogeological model of the contaminants' migration and degradation. The existence of strong reducing conditions {{in some parts of}} the aquifer is first determined by measuring in situ the redox potential and dissolved oxygen, dissolved ferrous iron and chloride concentrations. Electrical resistivity imaging and electromagnetic mapping, using the Slingram method, are then used to determine the shape of the pollutant plume. A decreasing empirical exponential relation between measured chloride concentrations in the water and aquifer electrical resistivity is observed; the resistivity formation factor calculated at a few points also shows a major contribution of chloride concentration in the resistivity of the saturated porous medium. MODFLOW software and MT 3 D 99 first-order parent-daughter chain reaction and the RT 3 D aerobic-anaerobic model for tetrachloroethene (PCE) /trichloroethene (TCE) dechlorination are finally used for a first attempt at modeling the degradation of the chlorinated <b>ethenes.</b> After calibration, the distribution of the chlorinated <b>ethenes</b> and their degradation products simulated with the model approximately reflects the mean measured values in the observation wells, confirming the data-derived image of the plume...|$|R

Anaerobic communities reductively dechlorinating PCE, trichloroethene (TCE) and dichloroethenes were enriched from various sources. The maximum rates of dechlorination observed for various chloroethenes in these batch enrichments were: PCE to TCE (341 mu mol l(- 1) day(- 1)), TCE to cis-dichloroethene (159 mu mol l(- 1) day(- 1)), cis-dichloroethene to chloroethene (99 mu mol l(- 1) day(- 1)) and trans-dichloroethene to chloroethene (22 mu mol l(- 1) day(- 1)). A mixture of these enrichments was inoculated into an anoxic fixed-bed upflow column.
