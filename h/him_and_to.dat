5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> attempt to take his life.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates called on the {{military}} authorities to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew {{seems to have been}} less than loyal to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. The aristocrats were infuriated against <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E

Anshuman realizes that he misunderstood Paakhi <b>and</b> writes <b>to</b> her to come back. Paakhi writes back saying she can't live with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> moves <b>to</b> Singapore. He follows her there <b>and</b> apologizes <b>to</b> her. Paakhi forgives <b>him</b> <b>and</b> agrees <b>to</b> return to India with him to restart their life.|$|R

5|$|Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy {{to take up}} the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380. Oswald {{launched}} an appeal to Clement, but a letter to Thomas dated 29 October 1381, confirmed this had been rejected. A further letter was sent, as follows:To the bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld. Mandate to enquire into the claim advanced by Oswald, claustral prior of Glenluys, O. Cist., Galloway diocese, to be the true bishop of Galloway in virtue of his election by the chapter of Galloway and subsequent provision made by Urban VI. They are to impose silence on <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> put Thomas de Rossy, provided to the bishopric by Clement VII and duly consecrated, into peaceful possession. The cancellation of Oswald's appointment {{does not appear to have}} silenced Oswald, who appears active in England, a kingdom which supported Urban VII.|$|E
5|$|Józef {{received}} a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka. While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski {{was held for}} several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: {{after one of the}} inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> health problems that would plague him throughout life.|$|E
5|$|Luís Alves {{arrived in}} São Luís, Maranhão's capital, on 4 February 1840. After several battles and skirmishes, he {{defeated}} the rebels. For his achievement, Luís Alves {{was promoted to}} brigadier (present-day brigadier general) on 18 July 1841 and raised by PedroII to the titled nobility as Barão de Caxias (Baron of Caxias). He was given the rare honor of choosing his title; he decided to commemorate his recapture of Caxias, Maranhão's second richest town, which had fallen into rebel hands. Francisco de Lima wrote to his son with news of the Liberals' demand that PedroII's majority be immediately declared. Meanwhile, Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later Marquis of Paraná, a distant cousin of Caxias' wife and {{a leader of the}} Reactionary Party) sent letters to Luís Alves attempting to undermine the influence Francisco de Lima had on <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> dissuade him from supporting the unconstitutional proposal to declare the Emperor of age.|$|E
