25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>steering</b> manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> pump, while the V8 model featured a Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|E

50|$|Electric power {{steering}} replaced the traditional <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> {{used by the}} Z3. The power assist is speed-sensitive, allowing for easier manoeuvering at low speeds. The steering has been criticised for lacking feedback. However, the Z4 M uses <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering,</b> and has been judged as having a more direct and communicative feel to the steering.|$|R

25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
500|$|They {{both were}} {{constructed}} out of [...] steel with waterproof bulkhead [...] below the waterline, a single smokestack, and twin masts, which {{could also be}} used for sails. The prow was reinforced for ramming. They had a number of technical innovations, including <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> systems and electrical incandescent light fixtures. The main armaments were breech-loading Armstrong Whitworth [...] cannons, one on the bow and one on the stern, mounted in stationary gun shields. These shields were added for weather proofing reasons, but restricted the angle of fire that could be taken, as well as the elevation they could fire at. Chaoyong also had four [...] inch guns, (two to each side), two [...] long guns, four [...] Gatling guns, four [...] Hotchkiss guns, two 4-barrelled Nordenfeldt guns, as well as two torpedo tubes. Both ships were equipped with two pinnaces, which were each armed with spar torpedoes.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the steering {{characteristics of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> system, a Modelica-based modeling approach is proposed. An automobile steering system test bench is set up for parameters identification.

The full version of <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> system model is established in Dymola platform. For the sake of validating the proposed model, the vehicle steering performances are measured in field experiments which test maneuvers include the parking-lot steering and the lemniscate-shape path following.

40|$|Abstract. Electric <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>{{steering}}</b> system (EHPS) is an on-demand {{power steering}} system that uses a small displacement and high speed electric pump. By optimizing the assist characteristic curve, EHPS can save energy more significantly than traditional <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> system. After overview of the energy saving principle for EHPS system, the energy consumption of the EHPS system is elaborated, and the energy loss of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic subsystems is analyzed. Finally, targeted measures are proposed for energy conservation...|$|R

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses <b>hydraulic</b> {{pressure}} {{supplied by}} an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering,</b> since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R
