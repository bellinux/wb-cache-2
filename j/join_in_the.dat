5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{defied the}} Versailles and Locarno {{treaties}} by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E
5|$|Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team {{against the}} ranked {{hierarchy}} {{en route to}} the championship. Up to three additional human players can <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably {{moving on to the next}} division.|$|E

5|$|Glenn Richards, Adam Donovan and David Williams {{grew up and}} {{attended}} school in Shepparton, Victoria. Richards began writing songs while studying English at university in 1996. He invited Donovan and Williams, who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, to join him; they in turn asked classmate Edmondo Ammendola to <b>join</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, citing its poetic, complex prose {{as a reflection of}} Richards' vocals.|$|E
5|$|However, Holly's {{group has}} managed to {{identify}} an Efrafan doe named Hyzenthlay who wishes to leave the warren and can recruit other does to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> escape.

5|$|Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard {{force to}} race ahead {{to try to}} {{intercept}} and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that Junyōs aircraft could <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft {{on the way to}} attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from the}} main culprits, many other players, {{including}} Brett Stewart, also <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brawl, with Stewart claiming that he was acting in self-defence of his older brother. Officials and trainers from both clubs also <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brawl.|$|R
50|$|The Second Promotion Playoff or Torneo Reducido {{was played}} by the teams placed 3º to 14º of each zone. Arsenal and Atlético Tucumán <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Round of 16, and Chacarita Juniors <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quarterfinals.

5|$|On 29 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico {{observed}} {{a moment of}} silence to remember Regina Martínez, after a proposal made by Manuel Rafael Huerta from the Labor Party (PT). Huerta mentioned in his petition that a year after the murder the circumstances were still unclear and the official version from the government of Veracruz was not to be believed. The president of the chamber left those comments out, but found the proposal relevant and invited deputies to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minute of silence.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{privileges}} of U.S. citizenship {{is the opportunity to}} become a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps. When there is a draft, a non-citizen can be drafted as a resident alien, or can <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ranks as a foreigner, but cannot be an officer without U.S. citizenship.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attack on the French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E
50|$|The Second Promotion Playoff or Torneo Reducido {{was played}} by the teams placed 3º to 6º of each zone. Atlético de Rafaela and San Martín (M) <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quarterfinals, and Quilmes <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Semifinals. The winner was {{promoted}} to Primera División.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{context of}} the song, in the film Robin and the 7 Hoods, is the mob boss Robbo (Sinatra) having just been acquitted of murdering the sheriff, a crime {{for which he had}} been framed. He walks out of the courthouse and joyously sings the song in gratitude to the gathered crowd of Chicagoans. The people eventually <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> singing. Instrumental versions of the song make up the opening and closing credits, and a dance band also plays the song in Robbo's speakeasy.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} {{gathered}} {{to watch a}} performance of Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots and this is Ox's chosen occasion for his experiment. Things start slowly and then speed up and become chaotic as the experiment proceeds. The audience <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance. Uproar occurs. Frantz challenges Fritz to a duel for flirting with Suzel. Hermance is left alone when everyone else has left the theatre.She wonders what has happened. She is sure someone must pay.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Harclay was richly {{rewarded for}} his loyal and {{competent}} performance at Boroughbridge. On 15 March he was created Earl of Carlisle, and promised lands worth 1000 marks yearly. Yet Harclay, {{who had turned}} down Lancaster's overtures to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, was no great adherent of the King. As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E
50|$|Returning to <b>the</b> Wilmington {{blockade}} <b>in</b> January 1864, she <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{expedition to}} Smithville, North Carolina (now {{the town of}} Southport) on 29 February, capturing Captain Patrick Kelly of General Louis Hebert’s staff. <b>In</b> July, she <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chase after , and on 24 August attacked Confederate batteries at Masonboro Inlet.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle and had run aground. After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the falling tide, however, Virginia was unable to {{get close enough to}} be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.|$|E

5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls <b>join</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|The plans {{called for}} the {{dropping}} of two divisions from U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew B. Ridgway to capture key territory and to generally disrupt German defenses to aid the advance of Allied ground forces. The British 6th Airborne Division was ordered to capture the villages of Schnappenberg and Hamminkeln, clear part of the Diersfordter Wald (Diersfordt Forest) of German forces, and secure three bridges over the River Issel. The U.S. 17th Airborne Division was to capture the village of Diersfordt and clear {{the rest of the}} Diersfordter Wald of any remaining German forces. The two divisions would hold the territory they had captured until relieved by advancing units of 21st Army Group, and then <b>join</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general advance into northern Germany.|$|E
