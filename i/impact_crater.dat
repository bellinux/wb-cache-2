5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an <b>impact</b> <b>crater.</b> Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the <b>impact</b> <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the ejected {{material}} from a meteorite <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> was discovered near Ullapool in Wester Ross. Preserved within sedimentary layers of sandstone, {{this is the}} largest known bolide impact from what are now the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In space, he is commemorated by {{asteroid}} 853 Nansenia. In 1964, the IAU {{adopted the}} name Nansen for an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> at the Lunar north pole, after the Norwegian explorer.|$|E
40|$|A {{compilation}} of circular topographic, morphological, or geophysical structures in Fennoscandia and adjacent areas reveals 62 craterform structures of which 15 {{appear to be}} of extraterrestrial origin due to meteorite impact. The majority of the structures are probable and possible <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{for which there is}} not yet sufficient proof for impact origin. Four of the proven <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> contain large volumes of impact melt and many other features of intense shock metamorphism. The age of recognized <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> vary from prehistoric to late Precambrian. We review the Fennoscandian impact cratering record giving examples of geophysical signatures of <b>impact</b> <b>craters...</b>|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the damage}} by PDC, <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> of {{ballistic}} blocks are found within[*]~[*] 2  km {{from the source}} crater (area “ic” in Fig.  3). Particularly, many <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> distribute in the northern side of Shindake (Fig.  4 F).|$|R
25|$|Non-explosive {{volcanic}} craters {{can usually}} be distinguished from <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> by their irregular shape and the association of volcanic flows and other volcanic materials. <b>Impact</b> <b>craters</b> produce melted rocks as well, but usually in smaller volumes with different characteristics.|$|R
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, <b>Impact</b> <b>Crater.</b> After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the <b>Impact</b> <b>Crater</b> table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Houston Chronicle {{reporter}} Carlos Byars told Hildebrand of Penfield's earlier {{discovery of}} a possible <b>impact</b> <b>crater.</b> Hildebrand contacted Penfield in April 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells, stored in New Orleans. Hildebrand's team tested the samples, which clearly showed shock-metamorphic materials.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the <b>impact</b> <b>crater,</b> hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.|$|E
30|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{are often}} {{produced}} when ballistic blocks hit the ground. Several studies on <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{have been conducted}} regarding {{the distribution of the}} ballistic blocks after landing (Fitzgerald et al. 2014; Pistolesi et al. 2008; Maeno et al. 2013). For the 2014 Mount Ontake eruption, Kaneko et al. (2016) studied the distribution of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> of ballistics from photographs they took days after the start of the eruption from a journalist’s helicopter. They defined A, B, C, and D zones around the vent depending on the number of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> per 5  m ×  5  m. These <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> were visible because they formed on the fine ash layer during the eruption. Ballistic blocks were ejected several times on 27 September from 11 : 52 a.m. when the eruption started to 12 : 40 p.m. when the fall of pyroclasts ended (Oikawa et al. 2016). For this reason, the distributions obtained by Kaneko et al. (2016) likely exclude some blocks ejected before the ash deposition. To estimate the ejection speed of the ballistics, we compared the ground distribution of ballistic blocks simulated using our numerical model with the distribution of the <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> photographed by Kaneko et al. (2016).|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} role of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{in controlling}} local Martian endogenic activity is reviewed. Martian <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> exhibiting evidence for endogenic modification are considered, including {{the style of}} modification. In addition, the cooling history of a mafic body intruded beneath <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> of different sizes which contain water-ice deposits are examined, and results are related to modified Martian craters. This analysis is extended to basin-sized structures, and evidence for impact basin control of major volcanic and tectonic provinces is considered...|$|R
25|$|Lofn {{is one of}} the {{youngest}} <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on Callisto. All its geological units contain much less small <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> than the surrounding crater plains. The age of Lofn is estimated at 1.393.88 billion years depending on the assumed cratering rate in the past.|$|R
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an <b>impact</b> <b>crater.)</b> All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{several other}} craters of {{around the same}} age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across {{striking}} the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> is contested.|$|E
5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere. Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs, which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E

5|$|Impact glass, {{formed by}} the impact of meteors, which on Earth can {{preserve}} signs of life, has been found {{on the surface of}} the <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on Mars. Likewise, the glass in <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on Mars could have preserved signs of life if life existed at the site.|$|R
40|$|Observations of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on Venus by Magellan yield {{important}} insights into: (1) {{atmospheric effects}} on the formation of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> and their attendant ejecta deposits and (2) the resurfacing history of the planet. Most craters smaller than 15 km are classified as irregular; they possess irregularly shaped rims, and multiple hummocky floors. The irregular nature of these craters is interpreted to be the consequence of breakup and dispersion of incoming meteoroids by the dense atmosphere. Two major ejecta facies of venusian <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> are hummocky ejecta and outer ejecta. A number of craters documented in the Magellan images possess often non-radial, flow-like ejecta indicative of a low viscosity materials. Approximately half of the <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> observed with the Magellan radar are partially or wholly surrounded by areas with low radar backscatter cross sections...|$|R
5|$|Shackleton is an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> {{that lies}} at the south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Oberon was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and is primarily responsible for its present-day appearance. The latter processes were active for a period following the moon's formation. The endogenic processes were mainly tectonic in nature {{and led to the}} formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The canyons obliterated parts of the older surface. The cracking of the crust was caused by the expansion of Oberon by about 0.5%, which occurred in two phases corresponding to the old and young canyons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>crater</b> diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Tethyan <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{are of a}} simple central peak type. Those more than 150km in diameter show more complex peak ring morphology. Only Odysseus crater has a central depression resembling a central pit. Older <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> are somewhat shallower than young ones implying a degree of relaxation.|$|R

5|$|Publication of the 1980 paper brought {{criticism}} from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> called Chicxulub was found {{off the coast of}} Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs may have occurred rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E
50|$|Crater {{counting}} is {{a method}} for estimating the age of a planet's surface. The method {{is based upon the}} assumptions that a new surface forms with zero <b>impact</b> <b>craters,</b> and that <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> accumulate at some constant rate. The method has been calibrated using the ages of samples returned from the Moon.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} obliteration {{suffered}} by Martian <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> is quantified by comparing measurable {{attributes of the}} current crater shape to those values expected for a fresh crater of identical size. Crater diameters are measured from profiles obtained using photoclinometry across the structure. The relationship between the diameter of a fresh crater and a crater depth, floor width, rim height, central peak height, etc. was determined by empirical studies performed on fresh Martian <b>impact</b> <b>craters.</b> We utilized the changes in crater depth and rim height to judge the degree of obliteration suffered by Martian <b>impact</b> <b>craters...</b>|$|R

5|$|The geology of Titania was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface. Additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later {{and led to the}} formation of smooth plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open {{the path to the}} Phazon meteor <b>impact</b> <b>crater,</b> while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some of the items are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress. For example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E
