25|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority. Unlike other waste disposal authorities in Greater London, Croydon's rubbish is collected independently and isn't part of a waste authority unit. Locally produced <b>inert</b> <b>waste</b> for disposal is sent to landfill {{in the south of}} Croydon. There have recently been calls by the ODPM to bring waste management powers to the Greater London Authority, giving it a waste function. The Mayor of London has made repeated attempts to bring the different waste authorities together, to form a single waste authority in London. This has faced significant opposition from existing authorities. However, it has had significant support from all other sectors and the surrounding regions managing most of London's waste. Croydon has the joint best recycling rate in London, at 36%, but the refuse collectors have been criticised for their rushed performance lacking quality. Croydon's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is EDF Energy Networks; there are no power stations in the borough. Thames Water manages Croydon's drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including Beckton and King George VI.

40|$|Contaminated sites {{form one}} of the major causes of {{environmental}} pollutions, in particular those of the soil and of the underground. One of the main problems presented by these sites is their location. Since water is the main contamination support in soil and underground, it is necessary to get good indicators to be able to detect pollution sources in areas where suspected sites location remains unknown. This is also necessary for the monitoring of contaminated sites in time and space. The aim of this project is to enhance the use of inorganic trace elements by offering specialists a new investigation tool adapted to a survey strategy of contaminated sites in various geological conditions like those found in Switzerland. This study has shown, through numerous site descriptions (41 sites) and the statistical approach of collected samples (222 samples), that the use of inorganic trace elements is helpful for the survey of contaminated sites. The most interesting result shows specific indicators for hazardous waste. Principal results Some inorganic trace elements represent almost exclusively hazardous wastes, since they are missing in the domestic and in the <b>inert</b> <b>wastes.</b> We also showed that these trace elements are typical indicators allowing to detect the presence of hazardous waste mixed with domestic wastes. These elements are : Se, As, W, Cs, Sc, Bi, Ga, Hg, Ag. Domestic and <b>inert</b> <b>wastes</b> do not show any characteristical trace elements. In general one can find the following elements in more or less important amounts in domestic wastes : Cu, U, La, B, Al, Ni, Co and Zn, Li in <b>inert</b> <b>wastes.</b> We also noticed that main inorganic trace elements in landfill leachates are : B, Ba and Br, of which the concentration is often close to or greater than mg/l. Tritium is also often associated to landfills. The comparison between uninfluenced groundwater collected during this study and polluted groundwater has allowed to value some inorganic trace elements. These elements differ significantly from the natural background when polluted sites are encountered. We distinguished specific indicators that are not present in uninfluenced groundwater : Cs, Sb, Sn, Ag, Bi, La, Se and tritium. We also put forward the presence of typical tracers showing anomalous concentrations in case of pollution by landfills, such as : Ti, Co, V, Ni, Cu, Ba, Br and B. Guide values could be established for these elements for their use in detecting contaminated sites. The same process was adopted for a limited amount of samples in surface waters. The significant trace elements are the same as for groundwater, except Sn and La. Hg, Cd and Pb which, on the other hand, could be detected at significant concentrations in cases of pollutions by contaminated sites...|$|R

By a fast air cooling, most of the granules from the granulation are spherical, with a low internal porosity and dense structure. Content of Fe 2 O 3 in the granules increased from 7. 92 % to 18. 4 % and FeO decreased from 14. 3 % to 7. 8 %, due to an oxidation during the slag granulation.

The wastes were reported to be non-hazardous and/or inert. However, specific information documenting the types and quantities of wastes was not available. The surface of the site was described as level and supporting a variety of grasses. No evidence of stressed vegetation was noted during the IAS. The western, northern, and eastern boundaries of the site are clearly defined by steep banks rising an estimated 10 to 20 feet in elevation. In November 1999 a Virginia Department of Environment Field Investigation was conducted at Site 7 to verify the presence of a debris disposal area. One sediment sample was collected from the low-lying area to the east of the bermed area. Ten test pits were excavated to confirm the presence of buried debris. The test pit investigation revealed that debris is buried in the northern portion of the site. Aroclor-1260, a PCB pollutant, was detected in the sediment sample.

40|$|Waste from {{construction}} and demolition activities {{represents one of}} the highest volumes of waste in Europe. 500 million tonnes are produced throughout the whole EU every year. In some EU members like Spain, approximately 83 per cent of such waste is disposed in landfills.

This tool incorporates the mathematical relationship among the activities of the landfill and provides as a result the economic viability of using recycled aggregates compared to aggregates from quarries. Therefore, knowing the needs of aggregates in landfills (dams, drainage layers, covering layers, collection wells, etc.) may determine the amount of IW that could be recovered. These calculations can be obtained from some of the data that is introduced (population, land physiography, etc.). Furthermore, the use of LABWASTE. 14 makes it possible to reduce the demand for aggregates from quarries...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the recent}} Spanish legislation, the amount of {{non-hazardous}} construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) by weight must be reduced by at least 70 % by 2020. However, the current behavior of the stakeholders involved in the waste management process make this goal difficult to achieve. In order to boost changes in their strategies, we firstly describe an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on regulation measures and economic incentives which incorporate universities as a key new actor {{in order to create}} a 3 Rs model (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) in the C&D waste management with costs savings. The target areas are focused mainly on producer responsibility, promotion of low-waste building technologies and creation of green jobs to fulfill three main objectives: valorization of <b>inert</b> <b>wastes,</b> elimination of illegal landfills and stimulation of demand for recycled C&D wastes. To achieve this latter goal, we have also designed a simulation model—using the Systems Dynamic methodology—to assess the potential impact of two policies (incentives and tax penalties) in order to evaluate how the government can influence the behavior of the firms in the recycling system of C&D waste aggregates.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{efficiency}} of iron-based oxy-hydroxides to remove antimony from groundwater {{to meet the requirements}} of drinking water regulations. Results obtained by batch adsorption experiments indicated that the qualified iron oxy-hydroxide (FeOOH), synthesized at pH 4 for maintaining a high positive charge density (2. 5 mmol OH−/g) achieved a residual concentration of Sb(III) below the EU drinking water regulation limit of 5 μg/L by providing an adsorption capacity of 3. 1 mg/g. This is more than twice greater compared either to similar commercial FeOOHs (GFH, Bayoxide) or to tetravalent manganese feroxyhyte (Fe-MnOOH) adsorbents. In contrast, all tested adsorbents failed to achieve a residual concentration below 5 μg/L for Sb(V). The higher efficiency of the qualified FeOOH was confirmed by rapid small-scale column tests, since an adsorption capacity of 3 mg Sb(III) /g was determined at a breakthrough concentration of 5 μg/L. However, it completely failed to achieve Sb(V) concentrations below 5 μg/L even {{at the beginning of the}} column experiments. The results of leaching tests classified the spent qualified FeOOH to <b>inert</b> <b>wastes.</b> Considering the rapid kinetics of this process (i. e., 85 % of total removal was performed within 10 min), the developed qualified adsorbent may be promoted as a prospective material for point-of-use Sb(III) removal from water in vulnerable communities, since the adsorbent’s cost was estimated to be close to 30 ± 3. 4 €/ 103 m 3 for every 10 μg Sb(III) /L removed...|$|R
