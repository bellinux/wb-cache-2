40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{successful}} application of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past few years. There are at least two reasons for this trend the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. The problem of machine recognition of human faces continues to attract researchers from disciplines such as image processing, pattern recognition, neural networks, computer vision, computer graphics, and psychology. The strong need for user-friendly systems that can secure our assets and protect our privacy without losing our identity in a sea of numbers is obvious. Although very reliable methods of biometric personal identification exist, for example, fingerprint analysis and retinal or iris scans, these methods depend on the cooperation of the participants, whereas a personal identification system based on analysis of frontal or profile images of the face is often effective without the participant’s cooperation or knowledge. The three categories of face recognition are face detection, face identification and face verification. <b>Face</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>means</b> extract the face from total image of the person. Face identification means the input to the system is an unknown face, and the system reports back the determined identity from a database of known individuals. Face verification means the system needs to confirm or reject the claimed identity of the input. My thesis was face verification in static images. Here a static image means the images which are not in motion. The eigenvectors based face verification algorithm gave the results on face verification in static images based upon the eigenvectors and neural network backpropagation algorithm. Eigen vectors are used for give the geometrical information about the faces. First we take 10 images for each person in same angle with different expressions and apply principle component analysis. Here we consider image dimension as 48 x 48 then we get 48 eigenvalues. Out of 48 eigenvalues we consider only 10 highest eigenvaues corresponding eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are given as input to the neural network for training. Here we used backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network. After completion of training we give an image which is in different angle for testing purpose. Here we check the verification rate (the rate at which legitimate users is granted access) and false acceptance rate (the rate at which imposters are granted access). Here neural network take more time for training purpose. The proposed algorithm gives the results on face verification in static images based upon the eigenvectors and neural network modified backpropagation algorithm. In modified backpropagation algorithm momentum term is added for decrease the training time. Here for using the modified backpropagation algorithm verification rate also slightly increased and false acceptance rate also slightly decreased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{content-based}} {{analysis and}} indexing of broadcast news recordings or digitized news archives {{is becoming an}} important tool {{in the framework of}} many multimedia interactive services such as news summarization, browsing, retrieval and news-on-demand (NoD) applications. Existing approaches have achieved high performance in such applications but heavily rely on textual cues such as closed caption tokens and teletext transcripts. In this work we present an efficient technique for temporal segmentation and parsing of news recordings based on visual cues that can either be employed as stand-alone application for non-closed captioned broadcasts or integrated with audio and textual cues of existing systems. The technique involves robust <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> by <b>means</b> of color segmentation, skin color matching and shape processing, and is able to identify typical news instances like anchorpersons, reports and outdoor shots. 1...|$|R
30|$|Real-time <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> {{technology}} can be applied in many industrial or commercial products. Many <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> applications use the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system which is proposed by Viola and Jones in 2004. Viola and Jones used the Adaboost training algorithm and the Haar-like features in their proposed traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system, which has a high detection rate but long training time. Many studies have attempted to reduce the training time and retain the high detection rate of the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system. However, the detection rate of the Adaboost-based <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system cannot compete with the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system when the training time is reduced significantly. This study proposes the judging existence of eye region (JEER) method to enhance the detection rate of the previous Adaboost-based <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> systems. The eyes are more salient and representative features than the other facial parts such as the mouth or ears, especially when mask is worn on the human face. Therefore, the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system with the JEER method achieves higher detection rate than the Adaboost-based <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> systems. Although the JEER computation results in a slightly longer training time, the training time of the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system is still much shorter than the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system owing to the efficient JEER computation. The experimental results obtained using the gray FERET and CMU databases show that the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system is effective in detection and efficient in training.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{training}} and detection times of the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system were slightly longer than the hybrid Adaboost-based face detector, they were still much shorter {{than those of the}} traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system that uses the Haar-like features. Furthermore, the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system achieved higher detection and lower false positive rates than the hybrid Adaboost-based face detector, as documented in the experimental results. Therefore, the detection rate of the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system is comparable with that of the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system that uses the Haar-like features, whereas {{the training}} time of the proposed <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system is much shorter. Finally, the proposed approach significantly improved the <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> systems.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{proposed}} <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system {{not only has}} a significantly shorter training time than the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system when the detection and false positive rates are comparable {{with that of the}} traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system but also a shorter detection time than the traditional Adaboost <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> system.|$|R

[5] proposed a real-time <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> method based on optical flow estimation to realize video <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> on mobile devices, which makes the detection accuracy close to the detection accuracy of convolution neural network (CNN) [6] method, and the speed basically meets the requirements of real-time monitoring. It {{can be applied to}} medium- and low-end devices and cannot meet the performance of high resolution. Approximately 90 % of <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> devices in the market are provided with front-end image acquisition while <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> in back-end server. These devices deeply rely on networks, slowing detection down, which are not applicable to the places encountering unsatisfactory network state, thereby consequently worsening application effect [7]. Yu’s [8] Face Terminal Identity Recognition Simulation technology for mobile device network security does not specify what kind of mobile device is suitable for, nor does it verify on Microsoft HoloLens devices. The current <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> in Microsoft HoloLens can only be achieved by remote call of <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> application programming interface (API) which is, however, restricted by network, resulting in slow detection and failing to meet real-time detection demand. This paper introduces the <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm based on Microsoft HoloLens holographic glasses. Such algorithm is upgraded from Viola-Jones [9 – 12] classical algorithm building on Haar-like [13] rectangle feature expansion and is accelerated relying on two-dimensional convolution separation and image re-sampling technique.

Human <b>face</b> <b>detection</b> plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing applications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database management, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an inconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different illumination, poses, and occlusion.
