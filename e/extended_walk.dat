50|$|A {{walking tour}} is an <b>extended</b> <b>walk</b> in the countryside, {{undertaken}} by an individual, or group for several days. Walking tours have their {{origin in the}} Romantic movement of the late 18th, early 19th-century. It has some similarities with backpacking, trekking, and also tramping in New Zealand, though it need not take place in remote places. In the late 20th-century, with proliferation of official and unofficial long distance walking routes, walkers now are more likely to follow a long distance way, than to plan their own walking tour. Such tours are also organized by commercial companies, and can have a professional guide, or are self-guided; in these commercially organized tours, luggage is often transported between accommodation stops.|$|E
50|$|The walk {{harbours}} many Aboriginal {{sacred sites}} of the Arrernte people, who have permitted tourists to visit the sites. In the 1990s the walk was only half as long, with the section between Mount Sonder and Ellery Big Hole completed {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Presently, the Northern Territory government is advertising the walk as Australia's best <b>extended</b> <b>walk,</b> competing with Western Australia's Bibbulmun Track and Tasmania's Overland Track and Western Arthurs track. The original Larapinta trail plan was to end at Mount Zeil on the Western end of the West MacDonnell National Park. The terrain from Mount Sonder to Mount Zeil being hard to access by vehicle for rescue operations, the trail stopped at Mount Sonder. In September 2006, Belgian adventurer Louis-Philippe Loncke walked without resupply from West of Mount Zeil to Alice Springs walking off track and joining the Larapinta trail at Redbank gorge. On Saturday 16 August 2014 Jessica Baker and Meredith Quinlan set a new record arriving at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station in 60 hours and 59 minutes. They completed the track without crew and only the aid of drop boxes left at 3 locations en route. They are also in possession of the “Great North Walk” Record, another 200+km walking route which links Newcastle to Sydney via the Watagan mountain range in NSW.|$|E

Since most {{persons in}} {{emergency}} service wear {{some sort of}} headgear, we investigate how basic navigation sensors could be incorporated into a safety helmet and thereby be made truly wearable. It {{is well known that}} the key to solving the generic ubiquitous localization problem is the combination of different positioning techniques and sensor modalities. In this paper, a combined approach of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and GPS positioning is followed. An novel combination of neural-network step length predictions and helmet-mounted sensors is presented.

Forty-one individuals were randomly assigned to either the adventure-based therapy (ABT) condition (i. e., a one-day ropes course experience) or to a placebo-control condition (i. e., an <b>extended</b> <b>walk</b> outdoors in a group). Subjects were divided into two cohorts, each with treatment and control groups, because of safety requirements related to capacity on the ropes course. Self-report instruments were completed immediately prior to participation (i. e., pretest), immediately following participation (i. e., posttest), and at 2 -weeks and 2 -months post participation. Primary multivariate analyses of variance performed on state and trait dependent measures did not yield statistically significant interactions; therefore, results indicated that AB...|$|E

40|$|Total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) {{is widely}} {{accepted as a}} cost-effective management for the pain and functional impairment associated with end-stage osteoarthritis. With the number of procedures performed markedly increasing each year, there is mounting pressure on physiotherapists to meet a rising demand for post-operative rehabilitation with existing resources. There is an urgency to identify effective, yet resource-efficient rehabilitation delivery. Resource-intensive one-to-one therapy {{continues to be the}} most common mode of rehabilitation delivery after TKR in Australia, despite the lack of evidence of its superiority over home-based programmes from the limited research conducted in this area. The use of group-based therapy, another alternative mode of rehabilitation delivery, has not been compared to one-to-one therapy in rehabilitation after TKR. The primary aim of this thesis was to compare the effectiveness of one-to-one therapy, group-based therapy and a monitored home programme on improving patient-reported and performance-based functional outcomes in the short- and long-term, through a randomised, superiority trial. In designing this trial the rationale for two secondary investigations into outcome measures used after TKR also emerged. One study investigates the utility of an <b>extended</b> <b>walk</b> test for patients one year after TKR; the other compares the responsiveness of two widely used disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures and a generic health-related quality of life measure during early and longer term recovery after TKR. This thesis has confirmed that outpatient one-to-one therapy delivered within the first two months after surgery is not superior to group-based therapy or a monitored home programme in improving function after TKR, as measured by a range of patient-reported and performance-based outcomes. Service providers should consider adopting these alternative modes of rehabilitation delivery as a viable strategy {{to meet the needs of}} increasing patient numbers without compromising treatment effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The thesis also provides construct validity for the Six-minute walk test as a measure of functional ambulation after TKR which, surprisingly, has been lacking up till now. Finally, the thesis provides psychometric evidence for patient-reported outcome tools that are relevant for evaluating rehabilitation after TKR and in a time frame that is relevant to short-term rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|In {{its general}} form {{the problem of}} {{orientation}} is how an organism acquires and expresses knowledge of its surroundings. The present thesis addresses this problem {{in the context of}} the basic task faced by terrestrial mobile organisms: traveling from one place in their habitat to another. Two distinct orienting functions will be motivated and developed for human locomotion, namely, orienting to distance and orienting to location. Orienting to location is awareness about one 2 ̆ 7 s relation to the numerous places in one 2 ̆ 7 s environment—more precisely awareness of how one is located. Orienting to distance is awareness of the separations of places in the environment and their implications for traveling. ^ Experiment 1 consisted of a production phase in which the distance traveled from the starting location to the end location exceeded the distance between the start and end. The production phase was followed by a report phase in which blindfolded participants either walked the distance traveled between the two places (orienting to distance) or walked to the starting location (orienting to location). The results of Experiment 1 suggest that blind-walked reports of location and travel distance are distinct and reflect the basic characteristics of the distance traveled through the environment and of locations within it. Of particular significance, weighting the body during the production phase affected the blind-walked report of distance traveled but not the blind-walked report of starting location. It was concluded that the length of a path between two places is not perceived as a physical distance along a path but rather as an embodied act of traveling a route. Analyses of the kinematics of production and report suggested that traversing a given path by legged locomotion generates an unfolding pattern of mechanoreceptor stimulation specific to the length of the path. ^ In Experiment 2 the concept of orienting to location was developed through two simple tasks of blind folded walking: (a) returning to a home location H following an <b>extended</b> <b>walk,</b> and (b) finding H from an arbitrary place. These homing tasks were conducted within two different environments knowable only by haptic perception, specifically, by the activities of walking and probing with a cane. The two environments differed in richness of structure. Half of the participants became oriented to the less structured environment, and half became oriented to the more structured environment. ^ Two models for what it means to be located were considered and contrasted. In the commonplace model, place is defined in a framework of Euclidian distances and locations. In the less commonplace model, distances and locations are defined by inclusion within a layout of surfaces. In the Euclidian framework a given place is located in a coordinate system. Its location is independent of the presence of other places. In the inclusion framework, a given place is located precisely by how it is surrounded by the other places in the environment. ^ The results of Experiment 2 revealed that the ability to orient to H in the two homing tasks were dependent upon the inclusion relations. When H was more richly surrounded the precision of homing improved. Perturbations of the layout of surfaces surrounding H directly affected the perceived location of H. Even subtle changes of distal parts of the surface layout appeared to have an effect. It was concluded that the location of H was not perceived as a location in an abstract imposed coordinate system, but instead it was located by way of a nested set of potential inclusion relations defining the surface layout. ^ Experiments 1 and 2, in design and results, give weight to the intuition that goal directed action is by definition embodied and embedded. For the simple behavior considered in this thesis, that of blind walking from one place to another, the places traveled between seemed to be located by their environment (and not by a system of coordinates) and the separation of those places seemed to be perceived in respect to afforded travel. ^ The general discussion focused on the methodologies adopted in the thesis. Specifically it focused on their potential for providing further insights into the general problem of orientation and the associated problem of place learning. ...|$|E
