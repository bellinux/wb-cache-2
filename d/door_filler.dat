50|$|The Rear Drive B-body was {{the last}} {{platform}} design to have the gasoline tank filler port behind the license plate. Exceptions included all station wagons, {{as well as all}} 1961-64 cars - which had the tank filler in the rear fender on the driver's side and 1965 Buicks which had their fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> above the license plate. Also, the Pontiac B-Body vehicles from 1941 till 1948 had the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> in the rear fender on the driver's side. Very likely this would also have been the case with the B-Body Oldsmobile and Buick.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the E23 7 Series, the E12 received facelift in September 1976. The rear-mounted gasoline <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> was relocated {{to the side of the}} car and the taillights were widened. The hood was redesigned to a give a 'power bulge' which accentuated the BMW kidney grille, and the dashboard ventilation was repositioned to improve air distribution.|$|R
50|$|The Interborough Rapid Transit Company's first {{cars were}} built {{with only two}} doors on each side, at the extreme ends of the car, lining up with the curved {{platforms}} {{so as not to}} leave a wide gap between the train and the platform. When the IRT modified existing cars and ordered new cars with a middle <b>door,</b> gap <b>fillers</b> were needed because the middle door was not near the platform. After the City of New York bought the IRT in 1940, new car designs (starting with the R12) had the end doors away from the extreme ends of the carbody, which also required the use of gap fillers at certain stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access door was {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the sliding door was on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the sliding door when fuel was being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the sliding door from opening too far when the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> was open.|$|R
5000|$|Later he explained, I {{was first}} angry that the <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> hadn't been {{properly}} closed but then I {{began to wonder}} why it wasn't being pressed down by the airflow. The only answer was that {{there had to be}} a source of higher pressure air under it than over it. From that session came the [...] "nostrils" [...] that have been a key McLaren design feature, including in the McLaren F1 road car.|$|R
2500|$|Changes for the 1975 {{model year}} were minor as AMC {{focused on the}} {{development}} and introduction of its innovative Pacer, but Matadors now included a standard [...] "no maintenance" [...] electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. New [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] decals were placed by the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and on the fuel gauge. Steel-belted radial tires became standard equipment on all Matadors.|$|R
50|$|Available {{for both}} Wrangler models, the Moab’s {{uniqueness}} was its distinguishing exterior features {{which included the}} steel bumpers front and rear from AEV (less the winch plate), rock sliders on the sills, tail light guards, front skid plate, black fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and a modified sculpted hood also from AEV (no heat vent). Color choice was limited to black, white, and a quartet of signature hues: Gecko, Dune, Crush, and Rock Lobster with fender flares in matte black only.|$|R

5000|$|The Mountain Edition is {{a special}} edition of the [...] "Sport Base" [...] model made for 2010 with 32-inch tires (on 17-inch wheels), black tubular sidestep, black tail light protectors and special edition seats, as well as visual {{enhancements}} like black grid and hood decals, a black fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and graphite dash enhancements. This edition was also available in 4 doors, based on the more equipped [...] "Sport" [...] trim instead of the [...] "Sport Base" [...] trim.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 a {{tremendous}} {{effort was made}} to improve the handling of the 911. Due to the 911's unusual engine placement (rear-mounted, with most of the vehicle's weight concentrated over the rear axle) early 911's were prone to oversteer when driven at the limit, and could easily spin {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced driver. In an attempt to remedy this, Porsche relocated the oil tank from its position behind the right rear wheel to in front of it. This had the effect of moving the weight of almost 8.5 l (9 US quarts) of oil from outside the wheelbase to inside, improving weight distribution and thus, handling. To facilitate filling of the oil tank, Porsche installed an oil <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> (much like the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> on the left front fender) on the right rear quarter panel. Unfortunately, this unique design was scrapped after only one year, some say because inattentive gas station attendants were putting gas in the oil tank. The oil tank was subsequently moved back to its original position for model year 1973, and remained there until it was moved back within the wheelbase for the 964 models.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{a special}} yellow SC2 coupé model was also built. The model was officially named [...] "Limited Edition", but soon {{became known as}} the [...] "Bumblebee Edition". 99 were produced, each with a {{certificate}} of authenticity. The [...] "Bumblebee Edition" [...] included embroidered headrests, black leather interior with yellow leather inserts on the seats and door panels, black roof and mirrors, number designation inside fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and certificate of authenticity. These are {{not to be confused with}} the regular issue Yellow Sport Coupe.|$|R
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Legends {{came with}} {{body-colored}} side mirrors. Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats. LS model coupes {{also received a}} trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production {{of the first generation}} models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> on the sedan had been moved rearward about 15 cm.|$|R
5000|$|It also {{featured}} a concealed fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and variable-speed windshield wipers (at {{a time when}} wipers were often operated by intake vacuum, and so tended to stop when the driver stepped on the gas pedal). Its engine-turned dashboard included complete instrumentation, a tachometer, and standard radio (which would not become an industry standard offering {{until well into the}} 1950s). The most famous feature was the [...] "coffin nose", a louvered wraparound grille, from which its nickname derived, a product of Buehrig's desire not to have a conventional grille.|$|R
40|$|Phil Engelauf, STS- 114 Mission Operations Representative reports: {{the orbital}} {{rendezvous}} was successful, and today's activities includes initial preparations {{of the next}} day's extravehicular activities (EVA); he specifically mentioned tile repair, wiring {{on the outside of}} the vehicle to try to recover CMG 2 (Control Moment Gyro), and preparation for the external stowage platform. John Shannon, Manager of the Space Shuttle Operations and Integration reports from Engineering standpoint that the composites of the underside of the tile surface seen from pictures taken during the pitch maneuver were extremely clean; the Engineering staff continues to look at the focus inspection data from the orbital boom sensor system (OBSS) and other data to assess the condition of the vehicle. Solid rocket boosters were retrieved and are towed back to the Air Force hangar in Cape Carneval. Six target inspection (nose gear <b>doors,</b> gap <b>fillers,</b> chine area, external tank doors, trailing edge, and ice), and arm operations, foam, conservation measures, shuttle air lock, aerodynamics assessment and re-entry were topics covered with the News media...|$|R
50|$|The Arrowbile first flew on 21 February 1937, {{making it}} a close {{contemporary}} of the Gwinn Aircar, and a second prototype {{with a number of}} minor modifications followed. Studebaker were interested in the Arrowbile because of the use of their engine and ordered five. The third Arrowbile was the first of this order. However there was little market response and the line was halted in 1938, with no more production aircraft completed. The production aircraft had several changes, some of which aimed to emphasise the similarities with cars; there was a radiator grille with a single headlight centrally above it and also car type <b>doors</b> and petrol <b>filler</b> cap.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other {{motorcycles}} {{that offer}} detachable side or top cases for storage, the PC800 has an integral waterproof trunk under the pillion (passenger seat). The passenger seat {{is attached to}} a single trunk lid that hinges upward to reveal two storage areas that straddle the rear wheel [...] - [...] with sufficient capacity to carry [...] "two full-face helmets and two medium-sized gym bags", or [...] "two grocery bags", or [...] "four plastic bags full of groceries, along with a small bag of dog food." [...] The trunk lid is held up by a hydraulic strut and is controlled by a release mechanism under the lockable fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cold {{inflation}} pressure is the {{inflation pressure}} of tires before {{the car is}} driven and the tires warmed up. Recommended cold inflation pressure is displayed on the owner's manual and on the placard (or sticker) attached to the vehicle door edge, pillar, glovebox <b>door</b> or fuel <b>filler</b> flap. Drivers are encouraged {{to make sure their}} tires are adequately inflated, as suboptimal tire pressure can greatly reduce fuel economy, increase emissions, increased wear on the edges of the tire surface, and can lead to premature failure of the tire. Excessive pressure, on the other hand, may lead to impact-breaks, decrease braking performance, and cause uneven wear (i.e. greater wear on the center part of the tire surface).|$|R
50|$|In August 1974 the 17TS (R1317 with 1605 cc) {{finally made}} it to Australia, along with the European 1974 model year 15TS and 17TL with the later type dashboard. In early 1975 the 17TS was {{replaced}} by the 17 Gordini. Available later were the 15TS and 17TL with Gordini front suspension, inertia reel seat belts, tinted windows, tombstone seats and evaporative emission control as required by ADR. This was identified by the carbon canister under the bonnet, and hinged fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> in the LBR quarter panel. In 1976 a final shipment of 1975 model year 17s was made and stock piled prior to the introduction of ADR 27A emission controls, these vehicles, again due to their high price, sold slowly through until 1978.|$|R
50|$|The 1964 Imperials {{were the}} first {{designed}} entirely by Mr. Engel. Predictably, they bore a strong resemblance to the Lincoln Continental. The dashboards seemed more conventional because the squared-off steering wheel and electroluminescent dash lighting were gone. However, there remained the ribbon-style speedometer. A split grille returned after one year's absence, inspired by the 1955 model's appearance, and the faux spare tire bulge atop the trunk lid {{gave way to a}} squared-off protrusion at the rear, carrying downward to the rear bumper. A large boss in the center of it was actually the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> covered with a large Imperial Eagle. Horizontal, spear shaped housings hold a taillight and back-up light. Heat and defrost, always a popular option, were now standard.|$|R
50|$|Trim {{levels were}} standard, Deluxe and XE, while price range were between US$4,949 for the base two-door sedan up to US$6,899 for the two-door XE {{hatchback}} coupe. Standard equipment on all models were four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes and rear drums, {{rack and pinion}} steering, maintenance free battery, rear ashtray and bucket seats. Deluxe models added halogen headlamps, remote-locking gas <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> carpeted trunk and rear wiper-washer on the wagon. Deluxe and XE offered tinted glass, trip odometer, vanity mirror, dual remote mirrors and door trim. XE offered cut pile carpeting, analogue quartz clock, remote rear window opener, low-fuel warning light, AM-FM Clarion stereo radio, power steering, tachometer and 155/13 whitewall radial tires. Sunroof was available as an option.|$|R
5000|$|The Cimarron was {{introduced}} on May 21, 1981, initially marketed as [...] "Cimarron, by Cadillac", and featured a straight-4 engine (the first 4-cylinder Cadillac since 1914, {{and the first}} Cadillac with an engine below 2 litres since 1908) and a four-speed manual transmission (Cadillac's first manual since 1953), with a three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic optional [...] - [...] along {{with a high level}} of standard equipment including air conditioning, leather interior, alloy wheels, accent stripes, locking fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> power mirrors, courtesy lights, intermittent wipers, rear window defogger, AM/FM stereo radio, tachometer, tuned suspension, and stabilizer bars [...] - [...] pushing its base price to US$12,131 ($ today), nearly double its J-body siblings. The price was otherwise commensurate with other J-body models equipped similarly.|$|R
50|$|The 1968 Imperial {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{previous}} year. The grille changed to a brightly chromed one with thin horizontal bars, split in the middle by vertical chrome and a round Imperial Eagle badge. The cornering lamp lenses were now covered by matching grilles. At the rear, the horizontal bars over the taillights remained, but the gas <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> pull was changed to a cast metal eagle instead of a round knob containing a plastic emblem. All 1968s came with a Federally mandated energy absorbing steering column. The base level model was cancelled after only one year and the four-door sedan {{became part of the}} Crown level of trim. This was also the last year for the Imperial convertible. A total of 15,367 Imperials were sold in 1968.|$|R
50|$|In October 1975, {{the entire}} Celica lineup {{was given a}} {{facelift}}, with a revised front bumper and grille arrangement. The new model codes for facelift hardtop coupe were RA23 for general worldwide market with 18R engine, or RA24 for the American spec with 20R engine. The liftback were coded RA28 for worldwide or RA29 for US. Also available was the TA23, which {{was similar to the}} RA23, but with the 2T engine. The Celica RA23 and RA28 had a more distinctive bulge hood, which was lacking in the TA22 or RA20 coupe and in the TA27 and RA25 liftback models. The TA22 Celica also had removable vents mounted in the hood, which the RA23 and RA28 lacked. The RA series also had an elongated nose to accommodate the larger engine. The <b>door</b> vents, fuel <b>filler</b> cap, and interior were also different between the TA and RA series.|$|R

5000|$|Mazda began {{producing}} the Festiva as the [...] "Mazda 121" [...] for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing {{the car as}} the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] from Kia's South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged [...] "Festiva Trio" [...] was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter B3 engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, intermittent windscreen wipers, remote releases for the rear door and fuel tank <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994.|$|R
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|R
5000|$|For 1964, Lincoln {{gave the}} Continental a minor redesign, {{featuring}} several updates to further improve interior room. The wheelbase was extended three inches, both to improve rear-seat room {{and to improve}} the ride. The roofline of sedan versions saw several changes, becoming squared off with the formerly curved side glass now being flat. The rear-mounted gas tank <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> {{was moved to the}} driver's side of the car. The front grille was modified slightly from the 1963 model, it now featured a series of five vertical chrome accents that interrupted the square [...] "eggcrate" [...] pattern and were distributed evenly between the dual headlights. The exterior [...] "Continental" [...] script was changed and the rear grille replaced by a simple horizontally elongated Continental star on the rear deck lid. 36,297 were sold that year. A concept show car was built, called the Continental Town Brougham, which had a 131 in. wheelbase, overall length at 221.3, and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments, with an exposed area over the front compartment, in typical 1930s style town car/brougham appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Available as a two-door Wrangler or four-door Wrangler Unlimited, the Rubicon X is {{a version}} of Rubicon with electronic-locking front and rear Dana 44 axles, Rock-Trac {{transfer}} case with a [...] "4-Low" [...] ratio of 4:1, 4.10 front/rear axle ratio Tru-Lok locking differentials, six-speed manual transmission, BF Goodrich KM 255/75R17 tires, 17-inch Rubicon aluminum wheels painted satin black with polished faces and a red Jeep Wrangler 'icon' logo on the inside pocket, black front and rear steel off-road bumpers, front steel bumper featuring removable end caps and a winch-capable design, a dual-intake Power Dome hood, red tow hooks, Mopar rock rails, Mopar black fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> a red-silhouette [...] "Rubicon" [...] decal {{on both sides of}} the hood, Premium Sunrider soft top (optional black three-piece Freedom hard top or body-color hard top), Black leather seats, seat heaters for the front passengers, a unique gauge cluster features Rubicon X exclusive styling and a premium Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) with added read-outs such as oil pressure, transmission and coolant temperatures, digital speed and individual tire pressure; passenger grab handle with Quick Silver accents that are also found on the vent rings, steering wheel spokes and door pulls; Mopar slush mats, unique axle locker, sway-bar disconnect switches.|$|R
5000|$|... 1974 {{saw more}} changes made in {{response}} to new federal regulations. Replacing the seatbelt interlock, a buzzer would sound if both front seatbelts weren't buckled; the addition of 5-mph bumpers to the rear added still more curb weight. While the 429 V8 {{was replaced by the}} more powerful 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury, it now required the use of unleaded gasoline; a low-fuel warning light was added to the dashboard. The gas <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> was moved from behind the license plate to the driver's side rear panel. While looking similar to the 1960s sequential taillights, the new-full width taillights were of a conventional design separated by a central reverse light. [...] 1974 was the first year for special luxury group trim options, the burgundy luxury group ($411) and the white and gold luxury group ($546). These groups added upgraded paint and exterior and interior trim. Standard equipment remained unchanged but there were several new items listed as optional. Some of the most notable, and costly, included power moon roof ($798), auto lamp for automatic on/off of headlights [...] ($34), and power mini-vent windows ($70). AM/FM stereo ($152) or with tape player ($311), power drivers seat ($105), dual power front seats ($210), rear window defroster ($85), power antenna ($31), automatic temperature control ($74), and front cornering lights ($43) also appeared on the option list.|$|R
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was only}} a shadow of its former self for 1974. [...] With the Sportsroof model discontinued, Sport models were often {{difficult}} to distinguish from Gran Torino 2-doors. To add insult to injury, the Sport was even available with optional opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts. The Sport continued to have its unique emblems displayed on the grille, the C-pillar, and the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> plus [...] "Sport" [...] script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. The Sport now used the same vinyl door panel of the other Gran Torinos. The instrument package became a standard feature, as were 78 series radial ply tires (70 series used in 1973). Bucket seats remained an option, but now were a low back design with separate head rests. At extra cost, Sport door panels and seats could be highlighted with coloured stripes. The optional [...] "Magnum 500" [...] wheel was revised with the formerly chromed wheel rim replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. [...] Performance was even more lackluster for 1974 models, with power down and weight up. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost [...] heavier than a 1972 Sport.|$|R
2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and <b>filler</b> <b>door.</b> Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, tachometers were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|R
