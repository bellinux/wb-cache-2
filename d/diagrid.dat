5000|$|The <b>diagrid</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of diagonal grid) is {{a framework}} of diagonally intersecting metal, concrete or wooden beams that {{is used in the}} construction of buildings and roofs. It requires less structural steel than a conventional steel frame. Hearst Tower in New York City, designed by Sir Norman Foster, uses 21 percent less steel than a standard design. The <b>diagrid</b> obviates the need for columns and {{can be used to make}} large column-free expanses of roofing. Another iconic building designed by Sir Norman Foster, 30 St Mary Axe, known as [...] "The Gherkin", also uses the <b>diagrid</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Among {{his main}} {{architectural}} current works he has designed the Millennium Casino & Resort, Fier, Albania, a 500 hectars master plan which includes {{two of the}} highest multi-use towers in Europe which rise up to +400m. These towers have an elliptical faceted exoskeleton design for the buildings layout providing both gravity and lateral resistance for the building. The structural exoskeleton <b>diagrid</b> system creates an open, column-free environment. With spans between <b>diagrid</b> nodes of over than fifteen meters, views to the three golf courses and the 500 yachts marina from the interior are expansive. In order to maintain purely axial loads in the elliptical form, <b>diagrid</b> members are constructed from straight, rather than curving segments which make them more cost effective among other sustainable design solutions.|$|E
50|$|<b>DiaGrid</b> is a large, multicampus {{distributed}} research computing network {{utilizing the}} HTCondor system and centered at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. In 2012, it included nearly 43,000 processors representing 301 teraflops of computing power. <b>DiaGrid</b> received a Campus Technology Innovators Award from Campus Technology magazine and an IDG InfoWorld 100 Award in 2009 and was employed at the SC09 supercomputing conference in Portland, Ore., to capture nearly 150 days of compute time for science jobs.|$|E

50|$|The $125 million building, {{designed}} by French architect Jean Nouvel, has {{a height of}} 232 m, with 46 stories. The service core is slightly off-center to maximize interior space and flexibility of use. This was also achieved by providing <b>diagrid</b> columns of reinforced concrete set {{in the shape of}} a cross.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a <b>diagrid</b> especially designed to absorb and channel the forces created by wind and seismic loading, {{as well as}} the gradient of Capital Gate. Capital Gate is thought to be the Middle East's first building to use a diagrid; others around the world include London's 30 St Mary Axe (Gherkin), New York's Hearst Tower and Beijing's National Stadium.|$|E

50|$|Vladimir Shukhov invented {{hyperboloid}} {{towers and}} {{was also the first}} one to use them in construction. For the 1896 All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod he built the 37-meter steel <b>diagrid</b> tower, which became the first hyperboloid structure in the world. The hyperboloid steel gridshell attracted attention of European observers. In particular, the British magazine The Engineer published an article about the tower.|$|E
50|$|<b>DiaGrid</b> is a {{partnership}} with Purdue, Indiana University, Indiana State University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska, the University of Wisconsin, Purdue's Calumet and North Central campuses, and Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. It is designed to accommodate computers at other campuses as new members join. The Purdue portion of the pool, named BoilerGrid, is the largest academic system of its kind.|$|E
50|$|The Shukhov {{tower is}} a {{hyperboloid}} structure (hyperbolic steel gridshell) {{consisting of a}} series of hyperboloid sections stacked on one another to approximate an overall conical shape. The tower has a <b>diagrid</b> structure, and its steel shell experiences minimum wind load (a significant design factor for high-rising buildings). The tower sections are single-cavity hyperboloids of rotation made of straight beams, the ends of which rest against circular foundations.|$|E

50|$|The Shukhov Tower on the Oka River (also Dzerzhinsk High-Voltage Mast, Shukhov Oka Tower) is the world’s only <b>diagrid</b> {{hyperboloid}} transmission tower. It {{is located}} in Russia, in the western suburbs of Nizhny Novgorod, on the left bank of the Oka River near Dzerzhinsk (about 12 km {{away from the city}} center, Dachny Poselok). The tower is one of several structures designed by Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Shukhov; its power lines, however, were decommissioned in 1989.|$|E
50|$|As {{you can see}} in the picture, {{around the}} hole in the middle, there are steel {{reinforcements}} weaved with great delicacy. This kind of structure is call <b>diagrid.</b> A hole is 1.5 meters in diameter, and there are 3371 holes total in the outside wall of the Urban Hive. With this great number of holes, the Urban Hive could reduce great amount of weight in concrete. This is why the Urban Hive could go up to seventy meters with concrete wall.|$|E
50|$|At these power levels, {{the fire}} risk is amplified and air cooling {{is no longer}} appropriate. In {{the case of the}} Magnox design, this led to the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the coolant. There is no {{facility}} in the reactor to adjust the gas flow through the individual channels; this was set during construction in the <b>diagrid,</b> based on testing done on a mock up. Additional control over the reaction rate was provided by Boron-steel control rods in vertical channels.|$|E
50|$|Ben Coates died in Osprey, Florida on October 25, 2000, at age 76. In 2009, Purdue {{named the}} Coates {{supercomputing}} cluster, after him, continuing {{a practice of}} naming the machines for prominent figures {{in the history of}} computing at the university, which began with Purdue's Steele cluster. Like Steele, Rossman and Carter, Coates is part of the <b>DiaGrid</b> distributed computing network. Coates will be operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization, and the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, ITaP's research and discovery arm.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{has been designed}} by Moshe Safdie of Safdie Design who was also the architect for the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. There are two towers, {{one of which is}} leaning on the other. The leaning tower has been designed using a distinctive <b>diagrid</b> structure with flat slabs which not only adds structural stability to the building without the need for internal columns but also allows for a permeable surface with large windows. This allows maximum airflow and light which contributes to energy savings in heating and cooling and also provides access to the balcony for an awesome view.|$|E
50|$|The tower—designed by the {{architect}} Norman Foster, structurally engineered by WSP Cantor Seinuk, and constructed by Turner Construction—is 46 stories tall, standing 182 meters (597 ft) with 80000 m2 of office space. The uncommon triangular framing pattern (also {{known as a}} <b>diagrid)</b> required 9,500 metric tons (10,480 tons) of structural steel—reportedly about 20% less than a conventional steel frame. Hearst Tower was the first skyscraper to break ground in New York City after September 11, 2001. The building received the 2006 Emporis Skyscraper Award, citing it as the best skyscraper in the world completed that year.|$|E
50|$|DeSimone is {{recognized}} for its work with exoskeleton buildings, including the award-winning residential {{building on the}} Upper West Side of Manhattan at 170 Amsterdam Avenue. The 20-story residential high-rise features a concrete exoskeleton with a <b>diagrid</b> design and was developed using newly available modeling technology. The building's exoskeleton moves the structure to the exterior, allowing for flexible floor plans free of columns. A specialized concrete mix {{was used for the}} exterior structure which was made to look like limestone. Fiberglass was also used also used on the exterior. DeSimone was nominated and received a Diamond Award for Structural Systems from the American Council of Engineering Companies in 2016 for their work on 170 Amsterdam.|$|E
