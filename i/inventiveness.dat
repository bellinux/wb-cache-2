5|$|The Gold Rush {{propelled}} California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to {{a center}} of the global imagination and the destination {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable <b>inventiveness</b> and civic-mindedness. For example, in the midst of the Gold Rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.|$|E
5|$|More recent performances, led by {{conductors}} Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, {{have been}} acknowledged {{to show the}} music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall reputation of the music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical {{of the work and}} considered Copland's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and <b>inventiveness</b> as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E
5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its <b>inventiveness</b> and imagination.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley, the game's designer, {{considered}} {{making a}} sequel as an action combat game, but thought the concepts behind Blast Corps had been fully exhausted. After praising {{the game in}} a 2010 Rare retrospective feature, Retro Gamer writers craved a sequel. The magazine said the title was proof of the company's <b>inventiveness.</b> Steve Ellis, who was a programmer at Rare, thought Blast Corps {{to be among the}} company's most underrated games, and though its physics were now dated, he continued to find the game fun enough to revisit regularly. Blast Corps is included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015. The release's bonus features included behind-the-scenes interviews with Blast Corps developers. Blast Corps was a standout favorite among Rare Replay reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's <b>inventiveness</b> and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} <b>inventiveness</b> {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, The Female Quixote {{remained}} moderately popular. In the 20th century, feminist {{scholars such as}} Janet Todd, Jane Spencer, and Nancy Armstrong have praised Lennox's {{skill and}} <b>inventiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|As Minister to France, Jefferson was {{impressed}} by the military standardization program known as the Système Gribeauval, and initiated a program as president to develop interchangeable parts for firearms. For his <b>inventiveness</b> and ingenuity, he received several honorary Doctor of Law degrees.|$|E
25|$|The novelty and <b>inventiveness</b> of {{the last}} years of the century are best seen in the {{anonymous}} La Mariane du Filomene (1596) which mixes the frame-tale, amorous sentiment, dreams, and pastoral elements {{to tell the story of}} a man wandering through the Parisian countryside trying to forget the woman who betrayed him.|$|E
25|$|Among his chamber works, the First String Quartet and Second String Quartet {{demonstrate}} a solid knowledge of developmental procedures {{as well as}} <b>inventiveness,</b> while the Third String Quartet (1882?-1886) displays more mastery in instrumentation. The Quintet for Piano and Strings is a lyrical work that show a melodic gift despite some awkward moments.|$|E
25|$|Seiler's {{comprehensive}} practice—installation, performance, sculpture, painting, drawing—has {{sought to}} dismantle boundaries between art, science and community. His energy and <b>inventiveness,</b> and consistently visceral, visually arresting work, have established {{him as a}} leading Swiss artist of his generation. His 3-volume compendium of writings, drawings and photographs Kerim in the Sky with Seiler was published in 2012 by Nieves.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not without}} {{interest}} that periodic boundless mental energy, imaginative outbursts of <b>inventiveness</b> and creativity, are characteristic of certain Tourette patients. It may be thought that without this illness Dr Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; and Boswell, {{the author of the}} greatest of biographies would have been unknown.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{because his}} work was idiosyncratic, his {{subsequent}} influence was not widespread but is apparent in the Piedmontese works of Camillo-Guarino Guarini and, as a fusion with the architectural modes of Bernini and Cortona, in the late Baroque architecture of Northern Europe. Later critics of the Baroque, such as Francesco Milizia and the English architect Sir John Soane, were particularly critical of Borromini’s work. From {{the late nineteenth century}} onwards, interest has revived in the works of Borromini and his architecture has become appreciated for its <b>inventiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting in May 1925, the Copiaus {{performed}} {{plays by}} Molière {{as well as}} those written expressly for them by Copeau, using masks of their own invention. Their presentations were preceded by a parade of the entire troupe, accompanied by drums, horns and colorful banners. They performed on a bare platform in village squares or whatever indoor space they could find. Copeau continued his work with this troupe as best he could, despite his heavy schedule of readings and lectures. But given their <b>inventiveness</b> and creativity, his control over the troupe lessened.|$|E
25|$|Most of the 266 sternwheelers that {{operated}} on the Yukon River were large multi-decked wooden vessels. The A. J. Goddard {{is the only}} example found of the smaller steamboats. The vessel was not ideally suited for the larger sections of the Yukon River instead it had a short but successful career on Lake Laberge. Afloat for less than four years, the A. J. Goddard {{was an example of}} the <b>inventiveness</b> that characterized the Klondike Gold Rush. In 2010, the A.J. Goddard was designated as a Yukon Historic Site.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{engineers}} made routine use {{of ancient}} standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. Apart from that, they displayed {{a high degree}} of <b>inventiveness,</b> introducing most of the other basic dam designs which had been unknown until then. These include arch-gravity dams, arch dams, buttress dams and multiple arch buttress dams, all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD (see List of Roman dams). Roman workforces also were the first to build dam bridges, such as the Bridge of Valerian in Iran.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what led Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince {{traveled}} to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando {{was looking for a}} new technician {{to take care of his}} many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having just died. However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would be surprising if Cristofori at age 33 had not already shown the <b>inventiveness</b> for which he later became famous.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, a {{catheter}} is a tube {{that can be}} inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Catheters thereby allow drainage, injection of fluids, or access by surgical instruments. Prior to the mid 18th-century, catheters were made of wood or stiffened animal skins which were not conducive to navigating the anatomical curvature of the human urethra. Extending his <b>inventiveness</b> to his family's medical problems, Benjamin Franklin invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones. Dr. Franklin's flexible catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together {{in order for a}} wire enclosed inside to increase rigidity during insertion.|$|E
25|$|As a composer, Balakirev {{finished}} {{major works}} {{many years after}} he had started them; he began his First Symphony in 1864 but completed it in 1897. The exception to this was his oriental fantasy Islamey for solo piano, which he composed quickly and remains popular among virtuosos. Often, the musical ideas normally associated with Rimsky-Korsakov or Borodin originated in Balakirev's compositions, which Balakirev played at informal gatherings of The Five. However, his slow pace in completing works for the public deprived him of credit for his <b>inventiveness,</b> and pieces that would have enjoyed success had they been completed in the 1860s and 1870s made a much smaller impact.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Giolitti's {{government}} sent {{forces to}} occupy Libya. While {{the success of}} the Libyan War improved the status of the nationalists, it did not help Giolitti's administration as a whole. The government attempted to discourage criticism by speaking about Italy's strategic achievements and <b>inventiveness</b> of their military in the war: Italy was the first country to use the airship for military purposes and undertook aerial bombing on the Ottoman forces. The war radicalized the Italian Socialist Party: anti-war revolutionaries led by future-Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini called for violence to bring down the government. Giolitti returned as Prime Minister only briefly in 1920, but the era of liberalism was effectively over in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, in {{solidarity}} with those affected by the Tiananmen Square Massacre, Fo updated La storia della tigre and wrote two monologues Lettera dalla Cina (Letter from China) and The Story of Qu. The same year, Fo also wrote Il ricercato (The Wanted Man), an unperformed play about the mafia, and Il Papa e la strega (The Pope and the Witch), which debuted in late October. The latter portrayed a Pope overcome both by a phobia of being attacked by children and by an attack of arthritis which leaves his arms raised in blessing, and who, acting upon {{the advice of a}} woman disguised as a nun and claiming to be a witch, swings from a chandelier and injects himself with heroin during his search for a cure, and avoids various assassination attempts involving a toy car, poisoned parrot and Brazilian nun. Critics praised its comic <b>inventiveness</b> and it won an award for being the play seen by most people in Italy that season.|$|E
25|$|Many {{economic}} historians {{regard the}} Netherlands {{as the first}} thoroughly capitalist country in the world. In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city (Amsterdam) and the first full-time stock exchange. The <b>inventiveness</b> of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the tulip mania of 1636–1637, and the world's first bear raider, Isaac le Maire, who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount. In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) – the Dutch Republic was at war with France, England and three German Bishoprics simultaneously. At sea it could successfully prevent the English and French navy entering the western shores. On land, however, it was almost taken over internally by the advancing French and German armies coming from the east. It managed to turn the tide by inundating parts of Holland, but could never recover to its former glory again and went {{into a state of}} general decline in the 18th century, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden, as main political factions.|$|E
25|$|Bernini {{was also}} a leading figure in the {{emergence}} of Roman Baroque architecture along with his contemporaries, the architect Francesco Borromini and the painter and architect Pietro da Cortona. Early in their careers they had all worked at the same time at the Palazzo Barberini, initially under Carlo Maderno and, following his death, under Bernini. Later on, however, they were in competition for commissions, and fierce rivalries developed, particularly between Bernini and Borromini. Despite the arguably greater architectural <b>inventiveness</b> of Borromini and Cortona, Bernini's artistic pre-eminence, particularly during the reigns of popes Urban VIII (1623–44) and Alexander VII (1655–65), meant he was able to secure the most important commissions in the Rome of his day, the various massive embellishment projects of the newly finished St. Peter's Basilica, completed under Pope Paul V with the addition of Maderno's nave and facade and finally re-consecrated by Pope Urban VIII on 18 November 1626, after 150 years of planning and building. Bernini's design of the Piazza San Pietro in front of the Basilica is one of his most innovative and successful architectural designs. Within the basilica he is also responsible for the Baldacchino, the decoration of the four piers under the cupola, the Cathedra Petri or Chair of St. Peter in the apse, the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the right nave, and the decoration (floor, walls and arches) of the new nave.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and <b>inventiveness</b> to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
25|$|China {{is one of}} Israel's closest {{economic}} {{allies in}} East Asia where both countries have placed considerable importance on maintaining a strategic and supportive economic relationship. The economic synergy has served the two respective countries greatly where Israel's global technological prowess combined with China's global economic influence, industrial manufacturing capabilities, and marketing expertise made cooperation {{between the two nations}} inevitable. China including Hong Kong is Israel's second top export destination after the United States and has been the top market for Israeli exports in East Asia. China is also Israel’s third largest trading partner and export market after the United States and the European Union with China being Israel's largest export market in East Asia. Israel has sought China's enormous global influence on world affairs, large consumer market, broad industrial manufacturing scale, and burgeoning economic dynamism while China has sought Israel as a powerhouse of advanced technological wizardry and a wellspring of entrepreneurial acumen leveraging each other's complementary capabilities and resources. China has sought Israel's technology to increase its international economic competitiveness and risk management. With the advice and experience of Jewish entrepreneurs, innovators, and inventors from the high-technology sectors, China has utilized Israel's indispensable economic and technological contributions to foster its long term economic development. China has also expressed desire for Israel’s advanced technologies, particularly in fields related to agriculture, telecommunications, and defense. The scientific and technological advancements made by Israel had led many Chinese politicians to respect the country's ingenuity and creative <b>inventiveness</b> because they know of the contributions that as Israeli agricultural, drip irrigation, and solar energy technologies are seen as crucial to China’s economic development. Throughout Israel's early economic history, many Israeli startup companies were acquired by major U.S. and Western European corporations. Since the 2010s, China and Israel enhanced bilateral economic ties with China connecting both Chinese and Israeli businessmen and investors to invest in each other's economies respectively. Chinese economic cooperation with Israel has saw substantial Chinese investment of more than $15 billion USD in the Israeli economy, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel's know how to help the invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China now ranks second after the United States in collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel’s Office of the Chief Scientist. Major Chinese firms such as Fosun, ChemChina, Brightfood, Horizons Ventures and China Everbright have invested significant amounts of financial capital and resources across numerous Israeli industries. Chinese businessmen and major Chinese corporations hold Israel's business, economic and entrepreneurial acumen and technological expertise with high esteem and have sought to integrate Israel's know-how with China's marketing proficiency, industrial manufacturing capacity and aptitude for large consumer market scaling.|$|E
500|$|Within Michelangelo's own work, {{the chapel}} ceiling {{led to the}} later and more Mannerist {{painting}} of the Last Judgement in which the crowded compositions [...] gave full rein to his <b>inventiveness</b> in painting contorted and foreshortened figures expressing despair or jubilation.

500|$|Although OK Computers {{influence}} on rock musicians is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced {{on a wide}} scale. Footman said the [...] "Radiohead Lite" [...] bands that followed were [...] "missing [...] sonic <b>inventiveness,</b> {{not to mention the}} lyrical substance." [...] David Cavanagh said that most of OK Computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on The Bends.

While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an [...] "altogether more conservative tendency", he said that with OK Computer and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a [...] "clarion call" [...] to fill the void left by Britpop.|$|E
500|$|Mischief Makers {{received}} [...] "mixed or average reviews", {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic, and a [...] "Gold Hall of Fame" [...] score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine Famitsu. Critics praised the game's <b>inventiveness,</b> personality, [...] "variety", and boss fights, and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low replay value, sound, and harsh introductory learning curve.

500|$|While {{viewed as}} a curiosity by some rock music critics, Wonderwall Music is {{recognised}} for its <b>inventiveness</b> in fusing Western and Eastern sounds, and as being a precursor to the 1980s world music trend. The album's title inspired that of Oasis' 1995 hit song [...] "Wonderwall". Harrison's full soundtrack for the film was made available on DVD in early 2014, {{as part of the}} two-disc Wonderwall Collector's Edition. In September that year, the album was reissued in remastered form as part of Harrison's Apple Years 1968–75 box set, with the addition of three bonus tracks.|$|E

500|$|In {{a report}} on Nairac's alleged {{involvement}} in the massacre, published in the Sunday Mirror newspaper on 16 May 1999, Colin Wills called the ambush [...] "one of the worst atrocities in the 30-year history of the Troubles". Irish Times diarist, Frank McNally, summed up the massacre as [...] "an incident that encapsulated all the madness of the time".

500|$|Musically, Tosca is {{structured}} as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses {{and other elements}} musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a [...] "shabby little shocker"—the power of its score and the <b>inventiveness</b> of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work {{remains one of the}} most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.|$|E
