Our empirical analysis of 18 German regional innovation networks shows that public research organizations, especially universities, are profoundly involved in knowledge exchange processes and possess more central (broker) positions within their regional innovation networks than private firms.

The Union consists of a multilevel system were social conflicts, different rates of economic development and various demographic dynamics dominate. The increasing territorial inequalities in the enlarged Europe and the “suspended step” of a monetary unification might establish the need to revert to regional socioeconomic cooperation, on the basis of the existing cultural, economic and historical bonds, like those of South-East Europe and the Black Sea, for restarting European integration and succeed inter-union stability and prosperity...|$|R

Variations in geographic, climatic, and socioeconomic conditions within the large country imply, however, that the impacts on maize production will likely be the opposite for the two regions. This finding challenges the prevalent view that the climate change has a universally negative effect on Chinese agriculture and implies that a higher flexibility of maize producing timing and a better regional {{adaptation to climate change}} in Southwest region could offset or even to outweigh the potential reduction of maize production in the Northeast region.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine the motivations for the European Union’s (EU) policy towards the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the EU’s most {{important}} relationship with another regional economic integration organisation. As such, the EUMercosur relationship has a prominent place {{in the literature on}} the EU as a global actor. This thesis argues that the dominant explanations in the literature [...] balancing the US, global aspirations, being an external federator, long-standing economic and cultural ties, economic interdependence, and the Europeanization of Spanish and Portuguese national foreign policies – fail to adequately explain the EU’s policy. In particular, these accounts tend to infer the EU’s motives from its activity. Drawing extensive primary documents, this thesis argues that the major developments in the relationship [...] the 1992 Interinstitutional Agreement and the 1995 Europe Mercosur <b>Inter-regional</b> Framework <b>Cooperation</b> Agreement – were initiated by Mercosur. Moreover, a free trade agreement was included in the latter agreement which negotiations finally started in 1999 due to the insistence of Mercosur. This means that rather than the EU pursuing a strategy, as implied by most of the existing literature, the EU was largely responsive. How it responded to Mercosur’s overtures, however, has been influenced by some of the factors highlighted in the literature, most notably the Europeanisation of Portuguese and, particularly, Spanish foreign policies. Also the Commission’s role as external federator has influenced as well, although to a lesser extent. Overall, however, these supposedly causal factors have provided only a very weak impetus for EU policy, which explains in large part why the relationship is much less developed than the EU’s relations with other parts of the world. Beyond providing a distinctive and empirically rich account of the EU’s relationship with Mercosur, this thesis contributes to the literature on the EU as a global actor, particularly {{the extent to which it}} is a strategic actor, and to the literature on Europeanization of national foreign policies of member states from a bottom-up perspective with the case of Spain and Portugal...|$|R
40|$|Since 1996, the European Union (EU) has {{launched}} several significant initiatives which seek to forge closer economic partnerships with various APEC participants. The 1996 Asia- Europe Meeting (ASEM) initiative {{has now been}} followed by the launch of a new Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) to be forged between the EU and the United States. These links will influence the evolution of APEC, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{as well as the}} potential Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). This combination of initiatives could contribute towards the gradual emergence of a global marketplace. On the other hand, since the EU and APEC have adopted very different models of cooperation, these new experiments in <b>inter-regional</b> economic <b>cooperation</b> could also lead to new tensions within existing regional groups. The TEP represents a new approach to the EU’s economic relations {{with the rest of the}} world. It does not propose yet another traditional, preferential ‘free trade area” and deals with issues other than the reduction of border barriers to trade. The proposal also indicates clear awareness of the need for the TEP to co-exist and complement other international economic institutions. This combination of features creates an opportunity to encourage the leaders of both APEC and the EU to adopt some new guiding principles for the nature of new cooperative arrangements among groups of economies. Such principles would seek to ensure that new cooperative arrangements among economies were ‘open clubs’ which took adequate account of the interests of others; these principles can build on and generalise the fundamental principles of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as well as on APEC’s principles of open regionalism, as expressed in the 1995 Osaka Action Agenda. They will also need to be applicable to the full range of international economic transactions, which now extend far beyond trade in goods and services. This paper proposes a set of guiding principles to facilitate closer economic integration among groups of economies are proposed in this paper; under the headings of: WTO-consistency, transparency, non-discrimination, accession and review. ...|$|R
40|$|From the introduction). The “Southern Cone Common Market” {{was created}} in 1991 not with the aim, as its name would imply, of {{achieving}} just an economic integration of its member states, but rather of creating a meaningful entity encompassing the political, productive and social aspects of its member states. By joining forces, its four member states (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) represent the single largest market in Latin America, with 210 million inhabitants and a total GDP of US$ 1. 1 trillion, representing the fourth largest economic entity in the world. (1) Since the 1994 Protocol of Ouro Preto, Mercosur has followed {{the spirit of the}} European Union in its ambitious objective of creating a large supranational entity rather than remaining at the intergovernmental integration level sought by other regional blocs, such as NAFTA. The EU has been working to strengthen its ties with Mercosur since 1992, with the signature of the Technical Cooperation Agreement. In the following years, {{the relationship between the two}} blocs has evolved considerably. In 1995, both parties signed an <b>Inter-Regional</b> Framework <b>Cooperation</b> Agreement, which initiated the process towards a definitive Association Agreement. A series of negotiation rounds was carried out starting in the year 2000 with the objective of hammering out the details for a free trade agreement. Beyond the historical and political linkages between the Mercosur member states and Europe, the association with the European Union is important for several reasons. First, from a purely economic point of view, both regions are already intimately tied as the EU is Mercosur’s largest trading partner and source of foreign direct investment. Second, as previously mentioned, Mercosur’s framework draws significantly from the EU model. In this sense, the experiences from the EU can represent a valuable resource at the time of designing Mercosur’s institutions and implementing any necessary policies. Third, Mercosur’s member countries, and in particular Brazil, are interested in raising their profile in the international geopolitical arena. In this sense, an association with the EU would give Mercosur member states a significant degree of leverage and prestige. Finally, and not unrelated to the previous point, any progress in its association discussions with the European Union could strengthen Mercosur’s position in the context of the future FTAA negotiations. From the European point of view, any closer relationship with Mercosur would be valuable because, first, Mercosur comprises two of the three largest markets in Latin America, with product offerings that are largely complementary to those of the EU. Secondly, Mercosur is the only other integration agreement that shares the EU’s values and ideals. (2) And third, it is an objective of the EU to avoid any deviation of commerce that might arise from the implementation of the FTAA. This paper summarizes the three main aspects of the EU-Mercosur economic relations. These aspects are foreign direct investment flows, trade and foreign aid...|$|R

40|$|Upper Silesia and the Ruhr {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agglomerations in Europe. Both regions are not only of economic importance for their countries but also involved in an economic structural change. Whereas it started in the Ruhr area {{at the end of the}} 50 s with the coal crisis, the process begun belated in the Upper Silesia in 1993 after the fall of the communism and the end of the COMECON in 1991. Therefore Upper Silisia was confronted with the challenges of the economic structural change over 30 years later. Hence both regions are suitable for a comparison and the verification of the developed methods related to the time lag of their development. Primary objective of this research project is not a descriptive comparison of both study areas but rather the identification of cities with similar characteristics and the visualization of topic interconnectivities in the main research areas. The research results of Pittsburgh and surrounding cities had been used to implement transatlantic experiences in the field of economic structural change and a view on different forms of cooperation. The comparison of such complex entities like agglomerations is also a challenge to the methods used. Therefore the application and development of proper tools is imperative. This is the secondary objective of this work together with the identification and inquiry of proper data. The latter consists of statistical data, expert interviews, surveys, press analysis and spatial data. The data collected was mainly analyzed with Geographic Information Systems and complex multivariate statistical methods. The key research statement is on the one hand the development and use of complex methods, and on the other hand the recognition of different topic interconnectivities in Upper Silesia and the Ruhr as well as the identification of similar city clusters in both research areas. It was shown that the use of geographic information systems and complex, multidimensional statistical methods successfully helps to achieve the research objectives. Especially the correspondence analysis proved to be an effective method for integral interview and survey analysis and the identification of specific city clusters. Due to the method scalability it is also possible to change the extent of the analysis. Respective to the regional analysis Upper Silesia is confronted with more social rather than economic problems. The often discussed economic decoupling of the Ruhr compared to other old industrial regions in Europe couldn’t be verified. Furthermore the suspiciousness against central structures, like metropolis organizations, could be detected especially in the polish research area. In both main research areas several city clusters with similar characterisitcs could be detected not only at the regional but also at the <b>inter-regional</b> level. Alternative <b>cooperation</b> forms, like the JEDDs (Joint Economic Districts), had been presented as substitutes for the creation of a central metropolitan area administration...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} clear among scientists that a continuous increase in atmospheric greenhouse emission is changing the climate of earth. Among various climate change sensitive ecosystem, agriculture is a key sector to support the sustainable economic development of our society in this century. Given {{the backdrop of the}} fact that the share of maize production in China and the U. S. is over 50 % of total maize production amount in the world, this thesis analyzed the interrelationship between climate change and maize production in China and the U. S. with a multidisciplinary approach, predicted the potential effects of climate change on maize production, and proposed alternative risk mitigation strategies to reduce the whole-country risk of maize reduction. This thesis did three case studies in China and the U. S., where climate inputs, socioeconomic inputs, and technology improvement (with and without) were taken into the consideration. While the first study analyzed the maize production in the Midwestern United States and Middle China with a semi-optimized supply function, the following two studies separately analyzed maize production responses in the North and the South of two countries with a regression function (Cobb-Douglas production function) and converted supply functions. The major finding of the first case study is that climate change will not universally cause negative impacts of maize yields in the United States and China. The results of a simulation of climate change on maize yields over the period 2008 – 2030 showed that variation in regional climatic and economic conditions could make the impacts of climatic change on maize yields substantially different in different regions. Even with significant changes in climate conditions that alter the maize crop‟s growing environment and affect crop yields, a decrease in maize supply due to a decrease in maize yields would lead to an increase in the maize price, which in turn would induce farmers to add more investments in production inputs to raise yields. Thus, the decrease in actual yields may not be as dramatic as predicted in cases where only climate factor are considered. The second study indicates that the impacts on maize production will likely be the opposite in the Northeast and the Southwest of China. The results indicate that a higher flexibility of production timing in the Southwest region allows farmers to better adapt to climate change than the Northeast region. Moreover, the gains in the Southeast may outweigh the potential reduction of maize production in the Northeast region. When a further reduction of agricultural labor population occurs, maize production decreases more in the Southwest region, even the substitution of more machinery for human labor is allowed. This result reflects that terraced, sloped lands in the Southwest region limit the effective use of machinery. The third case study indicates that under the same climate change South region tends to respond oppositely relative to the North Central region in the U. S., implying that one region‟s losses could be partially offset by the other region‟s gains. The different responses imply that the South region could provide potential risk mitigation to climate change within the United States and could help the nation maintain its maize production balance. All simulated results indicated that maize production could respond oppositely among different countries and regions through 2030. It has been noticed that advanced international and <b>inter-regional</b> contracts and <b>cooperation</b> as well as policies could mitigate the entire-country risk of reduced production and to stabilize regional agricultural labor force. Moreover, the gains in the Southeast may outweigh the potential reduction of maize production in the North region in China and the U. S. The risk mitigation strategies provided in this thesis are expected to impact the stability of food production self-sufficiency in China and the U. S. and the price stability of the international commodity market, as well as to be applied to other countries like Japan. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士（農学）; 学位記番号: 博農第 3943 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科農学国際専...|$|R
