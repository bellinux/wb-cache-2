5|$|Following a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> at Nicosia International Airport, {{the pilots}} {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E

25|$|On March 27, another 727 was hijacked, {{this time}} on a flight from Munich to Athens. A man demanded the pilots to divert to Libya. During a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> at Istanbul, the {{aircraft}} was stormed and the perpetrator arrested.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May the {{operation}} began. Lütjens had informed Lindemann and Brinkmann on 18 May {{that he intended}} to sail for the arctic and refuel at sea. Three days later, in Norwegian waters, Lütjens ordered a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> in a Grimstadfjord near Bergen. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision to drop anchor and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.|$|E
25|$|China Eastern began {{service to}} San Francisco in 1997 but has since {{discontinued}} passenger {{service to the}} airport, though cargo flights continue to be operated. China Eastern later resumed service to San Francisco on April 26, 2013. Passenger service to Chicago via Seattle has also been discontinued. Several Chinese airlines operated services to Anchorage, primarily as a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> but such stops are no longer operated, {{in part because of}} long range aircraft in service.|$|E
50|$|The 1998 24 Hours Nürburgring was won by {{a diesel}} {{for the first time}} - a BMW E36 320d, aided by its diesel engine {{requiring}} fewer <b>fuel</b> <b>stops</b> than rivals.|$|R
5000|$|On the 29th, she {{departed}} Pearl Harbor {{in company}} with [...] and [...] {{for her first}} war patrol. After a one-day <b>fueling</b> <b>stop</b> at Midway Atoll, the trio continued to their patrol area in Luzon Strait and waters southwest of Formosa.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, some races went to two intermissions {{for full}} tire and <b>fuel</b> <b>stops,</b> while longer races were stopped at three times—a limited break near the one-quarter and three-quarter marks for <b>fuel</b> <b>stops,</b> {{and at the}} halfway point for <b>fuel</b> and tire <b>stops.</b> If tire wear was a concern, NASCAR also {{permitted}} two-tire changes if necessary {{in the first and}} third period breaks. These rules were influential in driver development. Drivers had to learn to conserve tire wear for up to a half race, which allowed them to learn conserving the truck. Some drivers used the rules to learn tire conservation for other series. In 1997, NASCAR started phasing pit stops. During the 1997 season, trucks could only legally take fuel and make adjustments during pit stops during the race. Tire changes were still illegal except for emergency causes and at break times.|$|R
25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{opened the}} Challenger Round with a 12th-place finish at Chicagoland. At New Hampshire, he ran up front {{for most of}} the day, but an {{emergency}} <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> with two laps to go led him to finish 25th, two laps down, and {{at the bottom of the}} Chase cutline. At Dover, despite falling back at a few points, Earnhardt Jr. was locked in a battle with Jamie McMurray for control of the final transfer spot into the Contender Round. He almost did not make it into the next round, with his chances being saved thanks to a caution for Brett Moffitt's crash on lap 357 keeping him from having to make a green flag pit stop to replace a loose wheel. On the last restart, Earnhardt Jr. overtook McMurray on the outside, and finished third, clinching the final transfer spot and bumping McMurray out of the Chase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{race was}} broken up into two segments: a 20-lap segment, {{followed}} by a ten-minute intermission, concluding with a 50-lap second segment. While a pit stop was no longer required by rule, a reduction in fuel cell size (from 22 gallons to 13.5 gallons) made a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> necessary. (In 2007, fuel cells were expanded to 18.5 gallons.) [...] Many drivers also changed two tires during their <b>fuel</b> <b>stop,</b> as {{the time required to}} fuel the car allowed for a two-tire change without additional delay.|$|E
2500|$|Ethiopian Airlines has a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> on its {{flights from}} Addis Ababa to Toronto–Pearson and Washington–Dulles via Dublin on {{outbound}} flights only, due to weight restrictions on departure from ADD. The airline has no rights to transport passengers solely between DUB and IAD or YYZ and thus does not carry passengers from Dublin on these flights.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes for}} the crash - {{according}} to the preliminary report - were insufficient flight planning (disregarding necessary <b>fuel</b> <b>stops),</b> not declaring an emergency when the fuel neared exhaustion, and another aircraft emergency at Medellín being given priority to land by air traffic control.|$|R
25|$|On October 29, 1953, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines flight 304, a Douglas DC-6 {{en route}} from Sydney, Australia, with <b>fuel</b> <b>stops</b> in Auckland, New Zealand, Fiji, and Honolulu, crashed on {{approach}} to SFO into Kings Mountain in San Mateo County. All 19 passengers and crew members died.|$|R
50|$|On 26 February 1949, {{when the}} Athabaskan was on <b>fueling</b> <b>stop</b> at Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, ninety leading seamen and below - constituting {{more than half}} the ship's company - locked {{themselves}} in their messdecks, and refused to come out until getting the captain to hear their grievances.|$|R
2500|$|British Airways {{flights from}} London City to New York–JFK include a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> at Shannon Airport due to weight {{restrictions}} on departure from LCY. The stop {{is also used}} for US Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance, meaning that passengers arriving in New York {{do not need to}} go through immigration there. It is however not possible to buy a ticket solely for the London City to Shannon sector.|$|E
2500|$|Salvor {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for {{her first}} WESTPAC deployment on 6 September 1987. She was to accompany the tank-landing ship [...] which would tow three minesweepers, , , and [...] to Subic Bay. Salvor returned to Pearl Harbor to first to onload parts for Conquest and later with USS Conquest in tow, after a collision between Conquest and Barbour County. After more delays because of casualties aboard Conquest, Salvor departed Pearl Harbor again on 26 September 1987. After a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> at Kwajaelein, Salvor arrived at Subic Bay, Philippines, on 16 October 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Pan Am {{introduced}} the Douglas DC-7C [...] "Seven Seas" [...] on transatlantic routes in summer 1956. In January 1958 the DC-7C nonstop took 10 hours 45 minutes Idlewild to London, enabling Pan Am {{to hold its}} own against TWA's Super Constellations and Starliners. In 1957 Pan Am started DC-7C flights direct from the West Coast of the United States to London and Paris with a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> in Canada or Greenland. The introduction of the faster Bristol Britannia turboprop by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) between New York and London from December 19, 1957 ended Pan Am's competitive leadership there.|$|E
5000|$|On October 29, 1953, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines flight 304, a Douglas DC-6 {{en route}} from Sydney, Australia, with <b>fuel</b> <b>stops</b> in Auckland, New Zealand, Fiji, and Honolulu, crashed on {{approach}} to SFO into Kings Mountain in San Mateo County. All 19 passengers and crew members died.|$|R
50|$|Airmail service {{started in}} late 1928 when the airport was {{designated}} a <b>fueling</b> <b>stop.</b> In 1933 the City of Melbourne acquired 160 acre west of Indian River Bluff to develop {{as a new}} airport, which was further developed and operated as Naval Air Station Melbourne during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The Erie Lackawanna Railroad ordered 34 SD45Ms in 1969 and 1970. Intended for freight service, {{these units}} {{had a long}} metal head end; the extra space aft of the {{radiators}} had concrete ballast. Their longer frames permitted a larger fuel tank which gave the locomotives a greater range between <b>fuel</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
2500|$|May was {{hampered}} by the Jaguar's limited fuel range and an unreliable petrol gauge which caused him to make frequent filling station stops {{out of fear of}} running out of fuel. Hammond had attempted to prolong his fuel stops to the very last possible moment by employing the Vincent's reserve fuel tank. This backfired after his <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> [...] south of Doncaster, as Hammond was forced to pull over in the rain after breaking down. Having failed to close the reserve tank tap, sludge from the fuel tank had entered the fuel lines and blocked the left hand carburettor.|$|E
2500|$|Continental {{was one of}} {{the first}} major {{airlines}} to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller seating capacity allowed for [...] "thin" [...] routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as Belfast, Northern Ireland and Hamburg, Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Hamburg, Newark-Dublin, and Newark-Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the runway}} length and the {{distance}} to South Africa (3700km to Johannesburg), a Boeing 737-700 flying to Johannesburg serving St Helena {{would not be able}} to use its full seat and cargo capacity. Only flights to and from Namibian and Angolan destinations would allow using a Boeing 737-700 near its full load capacity. This was under the condition that both directions of the runway were available so tailwind landings could be avoided. The other planned destination, London, requires a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> in Gambia, at almost the same distance as Johannesburg. [...] However, if Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island was open for commercial non-military flights, it could be listed as an alternate aerodrome; as it is only 1300km from St Helena this would mean that the load capacity of an inbound Boeing 737-700 could be increased as smaller fuel reserves would be required, since the alternate aerodrome could be used in case of problems at St. Helena.|$|E
25|$|Prestwick still sees regular circuit {{training}} taking place, both military & commercial. The circuit aircraft {{usually are}} Boeing 757, Boeing 737 and the A320 Family. Military aircraft include the KC-10 Extender on <b>fuel</b> <b>stops</b> and the KDC10. Prestwick {{was also the}} first airport in Scotland at which the Boeing 787 Dreamliner landed.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{mountain}} {{is expected to}} take up to 5 hours to climb and descend for a [...] "standard strong walker", and a total driving time of 10 hours allows an average speed of 65 mph on motorways and 50 - 55 mph on trunk roads and occasional comfort breaks and <b>fuel</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
25|$|Salvor {{departed}} Pearl harbor for {{her second}} WESTPAC deployment on 4 January 1991. In {{the first leg}} of her deployment, she towed the floating dry dock AFDL-40 from Pearl harbor to Subic Bay, Philippines.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Thursday, 12 October 2000, USS Cole, {{under the command of}} Commander Kirk Lippold, docked in Aden harbor for a routine <b>fuel</b> <b>stop.</b> Cole {{completed}} mooring at 9:30; refueling started at 10:30. Around 11:18 local time (08:18 UTC), a small fiberglass boat carrying explosives and two suicide bombers approached the port side of the destroyer and exploded, creating a [...] gash in the ship's port side, according to the memorial plate to those who lost their lives. Former CIA intelligence officer Robert Finke said the blast appeared to be caused by explosives molded into a shaped charge against the hull of the boat. Around [...] of explosive were used. Much of the blast entered a mechanical space below the ship's galley, violently pushing up the deck, thereby killing crew members who were lining up for lunch. The crew fought flooding in the engineering spaces and had the damage under control after three days. Divers inspected the hull and determined that the keel was not damaged.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 August, {{the ship}} {{returned}} to sea {{to participate in}} Operation [...] "Teamwork '76." [...] That exercise comprised a North Atlantic cruise during which she transported equipment for a Marine Corps air wing. After a delayed transit and a <b>fuel</b> <b>stop</b> in Scotland, the ship finally reached the first stop on its exercise itinerary—Oslo, Norway. The marines disembarked there for a two weeks of training, and the ship departed for liberty calls at Trondheim, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark. After two rainy days in Trondheim and a week's stay at Copenhagen, Barnstable County returned to Oslo to reembark the marines and carry them to their next operation. On 1 October, the ship entered Esberg, Denmark, to unload equipment. After four days, she got underway for a liberty call at Nantes, France, where she served as the Navy's official representative at a celebration {{in honor of the}} Bicentennial of the United States. Getting underway on 11 October, the ship stopped next at Bremerhaven, Germany, arriving on the 18th and staying until the 21st. On 22 October, the ship moored at Esberg once more to load the marine gear. The ship made her final port visit of the cruise—at Portsmouth, England—between 26 and 29 October.|$|E
