These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.|$|E

50|$|A union, {{similar to}} a coupling, allows the {{convenient}} future disconnection of pipes for maintenance or fixture replacement. In contrast to a coupling requiring solvent welding, soldering, or rotation (for threaded couplings), a union allows easy connection and disconnection, multiple times if needed. It consists of three parts: a nut, a <b>female</b> <b>end</b> and a male end. When the female and male ends are joined, the nut seals the joint by pressing the two ends tightly together. Unions are a type of very compact flange connector.|$|E

5000|$|Generally {{it takes}} several {{individuals}} {{to build a}} hose load, at least one on each end. A third person handing the hose to the two individuals on the ends facilitates the process.

50|$|Threaded hose {{couplings}} {{are used}} in the United States and Canada. Each of these countries uses a different kind of threading. Many other countries have standardized on quick-action couplings, which do not have a male and <b>female</b> <b>end,</b> but connect either way. Again, there is no international standard: In Central Europe, the Storz connector is used by several countries. Belgium and France use the Guillemin connector. Spain, Sweden and Norway each have their own quick coupling. Countries of the former Soviet Union area use the Gost coupling. Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog, two municipalities on the Belgian-Dutch border, share a common international fire department. The fire trucks have been equipped with adapters to allow them to work with both Storz and Guillemin connectors.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as a sexless coupling, because rather than having a male and a <b>female</b> <b>end</b> connected by screw threads, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called hermaphroditic or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a water-tight connection between the internal packing gaskets. To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special wrenches are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.|$|E
50|$|The tubings of the {{aqueduct}} seen {{at ground}} level {{is made out of}} local granite (there are two kinds in this area), and so is everything else. The sections are little over 1 meter long with square cross section of 4 dms and bore of 1dm radius. Each sections has male and <b>female</b> <b>end</b> with fits fairly snugly into its neighbour. Most have a square hole upwards which is capped with a stone and a kind of concrete. The same concrete is used to seal the gaps in the connections. The upper hole is opened in order to clean the tubings, especially to remove the so-called fox tails (raposas) which are bundles of tree roots invading the aqueducts. Some loose pieces of the aqueduct are on display next to Mãe de àgua do Dr Alvim de cima.|$|E
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on the <b>female</b> <b>end</b> {{align with}} a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{previous}} survey [3] {{has investigated}} gender imbalance in European art museum websites. In this paper, {{we use the}} same criteria for thirty science museum websites in each of three major European countries, namely France, Spain and the United Kingdom. It seems that the science museums in all three countries are anchored in an aesthetic rooted more at the male than the <b>female</b> <b>end</b> of the web production aesthetic continuum. The implications for the gender balance {{of men and women}} in science professions is explored and it is suggested that a shift towards the <b>female</b> <b>end</b> of the web design production aesthetic might assist in achieving a greater gender balance in science professions. For the future, it would be interesting to extend this survey to further countries in Europe & beyond and establish whether this pattern is reflected there as well...|$|E
30|$|Two of {{the most}} crucial {{characteristics}} essential in modular systems are reliability and simplicity. To provide a straightforward and dependable system, developers of modular endoprostheses began to use the Morse taper between joining components [44].

The Morse taper in orthopedic endoprostheses consists of a male end from one endoprosthetic component that can be coupled together with a <b>female</b> <b>end</b> from another component.

This thesis draws from our ongoing work with users to help inform our design of theory-based methods for encouraging effective feature usage by both genders. This design effort is the first to begin addressing the gender differences in the ways that people go about problem solving in end-user programming situations. ©Copyright by Shraddha R. Sort...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper examines how female evil {{is represented in}} adventure games from 1982 till 2013 and how this representation of female evil can be understood in a cultural philosophical perspective. First, the philosophical growth of the term evil is summarized and the paper describes how media forms, such as art, literature and movies, have represented evil in the past. While these art forms focus on representation through images, sound and text, video games introduce interactivity as a new tool to represent, understand and occasionally even be evil. Observed is that female villains are represented through text, images, sound and extra diegetic material. By examining the female gender role of end bosses in digital games, the portrayal of evil is studied and it is shown that humanlike <b>female</b> <b>end</b> bosses become demonized oral villains as their representation is stereotyped {{with the use of}} symbols for evil. Only when the villain is a genderless being the female aspects of the end boss can be said to be of cultural importance...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the topic of {{microfinance}} as a method to alleviate poverty has been debated {{to a large extent}} in the academic literature. In India, the method of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) is today widespread among Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and has been proven to empower women economically and socially. Alongside, NGOs have increasingly directed their efforts towards more long-term development strategies, in which knowledge has gained a larger attention as a component to sustainable development. Even though literature from different research streams has confirmed {{that there is a need}} for effective knowledge transfer between NGOs to reach and empower the <b>female</b> <b>end</b> beneficiaries in the NGO-sector, few theoretical attempts have been made to understand the organizational dynamics behind knowledge transfer in an NGO-context. That is why we wished to further understand knowledge transfer in an NGO-context. Our purpose is to explore what it is that makes knowledge become transferred throughout an NGO-chain in order to reach the end beneficiaries. To answer the research question of what variables affect knowledge transfer throughout the actors in an NGO-chain and what factors determine these variables, a case study was conducted on an NGO-chain working towards SHGs in Uttarakhand, Northern India. Interviews have been conducted with leaders and staff of one foreign and one local NGO and two focus groups have been held with participants of SHGs. The findings show that several of the variables that research within knowledge management previously have found, including trust, communication, organizational culture and absorptive capacity, do have an influence on the transfer of knowledge throughout the NGO-chain. Furthermore, the variables networks, relationships, and organizational strategy were also shown to impact the outcome of the knowledge transfer. Moreover there are several factors in the intra-organizational and inter-organizational dynamics of the NGO-chain that determine whether each variable has an inhibiting or enabling effect on knowledge transfer. ...|$|E
