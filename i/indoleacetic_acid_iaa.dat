50|$|Early {{experiments}} on phototropism using coleoptiles suggested that plants grow towards light because plant cells on {{the darker side}} elongate more than those on the lighter side. In 1880 Charles Darwin and his son, Francis found that coleoptiles only bend towards the light when their tips are exposed. Therefore, the tips must contain the photoreceptor cells although the bending takes place lower down on the shoot. A chemical messenger or hormone called auxin moves down {{the dark side of}} the shoot and stimulates growth on that side. The natural plant hormone responsible for phototropism is now known to be <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>IAA).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Phenoxy {{herbicides}} (or [...] "phenoxies") are {{a family}} of chemicals related to the growth hormone <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>IAA).</b> When sprayed on broad-leaf plants they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth ("growing to death"). When sprayed on monocotyledonous (grass) crops such as wheat or corn, they selectively kill broad-leaf weeds, leaving the crops relatively unaffected. The wide variety of phenoxies in use today can be grouped into the phenoxyacetic, phenoxybutyric and phenoxypropionic subtypes, the latter containing the aryloxyphenoxypropionic subtype with {{the greatest number of}} commercial variants.

Seventeen percent of thestrains showed better growth on feldspar and effects on solubilization of K in liquid cultures, suggesting that they were a valuable pool for discovering plant growth-promoting bacteria. Two bacterial strains, AFM 2 and AC 2, exhibited greater K release efficiency than other isolates. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis(ARDRA) revealed that all isolates could be divided into 11 groups at the similarity level of 60 %. Most strains exhibited a unique 16 S rDNA restriction pattern even when strains were isolated from the same soil type or plant species.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Three {{types of}} {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} further characterize the tryptophan decarboxylating enzyme of Reed and Crecelius (1967). 1) Light inhibition studies were made with etiolated pea seedlings to determine the in vitro response of the tryptophan decarboxylating enzyme. Assays of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase (<b>IAA</b> oxidase) and guaiacol-active pea seedling peroxidase were included for comparison. The studies showed that IAA oxidase and the tryptophan decarboxylating enzyme had essentially the same inhibition response caused by constant exposure of etiolated pea seedlings to light. The guaiacol-active peroxidase was not inhibited. 2) Sephadex chromatography was performed to ascertain any differences in the elution of the three enzymes. A {{large portion of the}} tryptophan decarboxylating enzyme activity was retarded by the column. The activity peaks of the other enzymes assayed, IAA oxidase and pea seedling peroxidase, coincided with the main protein peak. 3) A study was performed with catechol to determine the type of inhibition caused by polyphenolic compounds. The results indicate that the inhibition was competitive.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1963. Bibliography: l. [69]- 73. v, 73, [1] leaves mount. ill., diagrs., tables (part fold.) <b>Indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a normal}} plant product which has been {{established}} to be a plant growth regulator. <b>Indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> when applied to plants will cause various growth responses. One response, promotion of cell elongation, is {{used as the basis}} of a very sensitive method for the detection of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (1). Initiation of cell division has also been observed after the application of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> as in the formation of parthenocarpic fruit, adventitious roots, activation of cambial growth. and the formation of callus tissue. Cases where the application of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> causes inhibition of growth have also been observed. Probably the best known of these responses are the inhibition of elongation of root length and the prevention of lateral budding due to the production of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> by the apical bud. The enzyme, <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase, which catalyses the oxidative degradation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> is also found in plant tissues. The function of this enzyme might be in the regulation of hormone level within the plant. However the regulation of hormone level within the plant is a complicated matter, since <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase, with its necessary cofactors, the inhibitor(s) of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase, and the enzyme responsible for the formation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> may all be found in the same tissue. Despite the amount of work that has been done with the enzyme, <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase, relatively little is known about it. Proposals have been made that the enzyme system consists of a flavo-protein and peroxidase (2), a copper protein (3), and an oxidase-peroxidase (4). <b>Indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase activity free from peroxidase activity has never been observed. However, it has been shown (5), that purified preparations of horseradish peroxidase can oxidize <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> if Mn++ ion and certain diphenols are present. Also, crystalline turnip peroxidase (6) and two crystalline wheat germ peroxidases (7) have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the cases, where known peroxidase activities have been checked for <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase activity there is only one report (8) of a failure to observe the oxidation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> McCune (9) has reported on the separation by electrophoresis of six peroxidases from extracts of corn seedlings and showed that at least the four components that moved toward the cathode all displayed <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase activity. The first conclusive evidence of the enzymatic destruction of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> was reported by Larsen in 1936 (10). He worked with an "auxin inactivation substance" obtained from the juice of pressed Phasiolus seedlings. This material was thermolabile and could be purified by precipitation with 607. ethyl alcohol. It possessed the ability to inactivate <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> as well as auxin extracted from corn. The reaction was also shown to require oxygen. Tang and Bonner in 1948 (11), working with extracts of etiolated pea seedlings, studied an <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase system. The inactivation of the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> was followed by observing the decrease in biological activity in the Avena curvature test (12) and by a chemical method (13) utilizing the color produced by the indole nucleus in the presence of FeCl 3 (Salkowski test). They found that one molecule of O 2 was consumed for each molecule of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> that was inactivated and that one molecule of CO 2 was released. The enzyme system was inhibited by KCN and CO. This inhibition would seem to indicate the involvement of a heme protein. In 1950 Wagenknecht and Burris (3), working with a cell-free extract of yellow wax bean, studied an <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase system. On the basis of their experiments involving the effects of inhibitors, they concluded that the enzyme was a copper protein. Galston and Baker in 1952 (14) using pea seedling homogenates, suggested that the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> system as it occurs in pea seedlings consisted of two portions; a heavy metal enzyme plus a light activated flavo-protein. Galston, Bonner and Baker (2) later reported that the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase of pea seedlings consisted of a light-activated flavo-protein coupled, through H 202, to a peroxidase. Their system was inhibited by catalase and Mn++ ions. The activity of the system was increased by the addition of H 2 O 2. An analog of the system could be formed by combining xanthine oxidase from cream and horseradish peroxidase. Kenton in 1955 (5) reported the oxidation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> by' 02 in the presence of purified horseradish peroxidase. He found that certain monophenols as well as Mn++ ions increased the rate of oxidation of the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and that some of the peroxidase substrates acted as inhibitors. He also demonstrated the presence of a thermostable fraction in wax bean extracts which acted as an activator for both the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase system of wax bean and for purified horseradish peroxidase. A 1 / 1 ratio of O 2 consumed to <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidized and to CO 2 released was also found. He concluded from his evidence that the oxidation of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> by peroxidase systems was not dependent on the presence of a flavo-protein. Ray reported in 1956 (15) on the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase of the fungi Omphalia flavida. 1 'bis enzyme was found to have a pH optimum of 3. 5. Its activity was not enhanced by the addition of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol but was moderately stimulated by the addition of Mn++ ions. the addition of Mn++ ions also prevented the enzyme activity from declining during the course of. the reaction. The enzyme was very sensitive to the addition of cyanide. He also showed that one mole of O 2 was used for the oxidation of one mole of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and that one mole of CO 2 was released. Later, 1960 (16) Ray reported on the relationships between peroxidase action and <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation in the Omphali flavida enzyme. In this work he showed that the peroxidase activity had a pH optimum of 3. 5 - 3. 7, which was similar to the pH optimum of the oxidizing activity. He also found that the <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidizing activity and the peroxidase activity paralleled each other through a three-step purification procedure involving an eleven fold increase in activity. The activity ratios were also closely parallel {{during the course of a}} heat inactivation experiment. The conclusion drawn from these results was that both activities were caused by the same enzyme. Using Lupinus albus as a source material, Stutz in 1957 (4) reported on the purification of an <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase-peroxidase system that had been purified until it was homogeneous by starch-block electrophoresis. the enzyme functioned both as a peroxidase and as an oxidase. When functioning as an oxidase it showed an obligate requirement for a phenolic cofactor and a stimulation by the addition of Mn++ ions. Both the oxidase and peroxidase activities of the enzyme were inhibited by the addition of heme inhibitors. However, the lack of sufficient purified material to physically characterize the enzyme limits the value of this work. Gortner and Kent (17) reported in 1953 on the presence of an <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase system in pineapple stem tissue. They also suggested the presence of an inhibitor in the crude extracts. The crude enzyme homogenate showed a pH optimum close to pH 3. 5 and required Mn++ ions for activity. They showed that the enzyme was inhibited by cyanide but not by 8 -hydroxy-quinol 1 ne. ibis would suggest that the enzyme might be a peroxidase and that it does not require copper. A later report by Gartner and Kent (18) showed that the natural inhibitor was probably ferulic acid or an ester of ferulic acid. They also showed that the naturally-occurring coenzyme for pineapple <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase was probably p-coumaric acid or a quiny 1 -p-coumarate [...] both of which were found to be present in pineapple tissue. The objective of this research was to extend the work initiated by Gortner and Kent. Where they were primarily concerned with the coenzyme requirements and inhibitors of the enzyme, this study was concerned with the isolation, purification, crystallization, and study of certain properties of the purified enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Indoleacetic acid-induced {{ethylene}} {{production and}} growth in excised segments of etiolated pea shoots (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska) parallels the free <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{level in the}} tissue which in turn depends upon the rate of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> conjugation and decarboxylation. Both ethylene synthesis and growth require the presence {{of more than a}} threshold level of free endogenous <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> but in etiolated tissue the rate of ethylene production saturates at a high concentration and the rate of growth at a lower concentration of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Auxin stimulation of ethylene synthesis is not mediated by induction of peroxidase; to the contrary, the products of the auxin action which induce growth and ethylene synthesis are highly labile...|$|R
40|$|<b>Indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase {{in tobacco}} callus tissues (Nicotiana tabacum L., {{cultivar}} White Gold) was resolved into seven anionic isoenzymes by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. Different concentrations of kinetin and zeatin {{in the presence}} of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> affected the level of this enzyme, particularly two fast-moving isoenzymes, A 5 and A 6. The optimal concentration of kinetin was 0. 2 μm; increasing concentrations above this level progressively lowered the total activity of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase and repressed the development of isoenzymes A 5 and A 6. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibited the development of these two isoenzymes under the influence of 0. 2 μm kinetin, suggesting a requirement for RNA and protein synthesis. The cytokinin-promoted <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase isoenzymes A 5 and A 6 increased with time and paralleled the dry weight increase of tobacco callus tissues, but the total activity of <b>indoleacetic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase per unit dry weight of tobacco callus varied with time depending on the stage of plant growth...|$|R
