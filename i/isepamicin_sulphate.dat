40|$|We have {{developed}} a new drug delivery systemusing porous apatite-wollastonite glass ceramic (A-W GC) to treat osteomyelitis. A-W GC (porosity, 70 % and 20 % to 30 %), or porous hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks (porosity 35 % to 48 %) used as controls, were soaked in mixtures of two antibiotics, <b>isepamicin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (ISP) and cefmetazole (CMZ) under high vacuum. We evaluated the release concentrations of the antibiotics from the blocks. The bactericidal concentration of ISP from A-W GC was maintained for more than 42 days, but that from HA decreased to below the detection limit after 28 days. The concentrations of CMZ from both materials were {{lower than those of}} ISP. An in vivo study using rabbit femora showed that an osseous concentration of ISP was maintained at eight weeks after implantation. Osteoconduction of the A-W GC block was good. Four patients with infected hip arthroplasties and one with osteomyelitis of the tibia have been treated with the new delivery system with excellent results...|$|E
