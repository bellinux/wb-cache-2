5|$|By nation, the {{greatest}} number of Auschwitz's Jewish victims were from Hungary, accounting for 438,000 deaths, followed by Polish Jews (300,000 deaths), French (69,000), Dutch (60,000), and Greek (55,000). Fewer than one percent of Soviet Jews murdered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been driven from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944. Approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> died at the camp.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members who were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes had buried their Torah scrolls.

5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} as Unsichtbare Gegner was released, the Nazis {{came to power in}} Germany, and the Jewish Cartier left the country.

However, unlike Wilder, Cartier did not find success in America, and in 1935 he moved again, to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won {{the right}} to a pension {{following}} a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959.

The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust.</b> The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Living With a War Criminal), which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.|$|E
