5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. This {{would make the}} storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide swath of damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The low number of fatalities is attributable to the extensive <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E
5|$|Despite making {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula on August27 as a Category2hurricane, {{no damage}} was reported there. As the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico towards the Texas Gulf Coast, <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> were conducted across the region. In the storm-warning area of Galveston, Texas, roughly 50,000people evacuated inland; {{the high number}} of evacuees was likely due in part to another hurricane which struck the coast a week prior. Camp Hulen, located near Palacios, Texas, was also evacuated. Other coastal locations were evacuated via trucks, buses, and trains with the guidance of warnings published by the United States Weather Bureau. Schools in the region were prepared as emergency shelters in advance of the storm's landfall.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Governor of North Carolina Luther H. Hodges and United States Senator from North Carolina B. Everett Jordan {{requested}} a disaster declaration for the state. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower designated portions of North Carolina {{impacted by the}} storm as a disaster area. According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> and resulting low loss of life after the storm, the Weather Bureau recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation with the Weather Bureau during the hurricane's duration. The recommended recipients were the radio stations WPTF and WRAL, and the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.|$|E

5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures.</b> Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} hurricane strength off the United States Gulf Coast, hurricane warnings {{were issued}} for coastal regions from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Sabine Pass, Texas on August 7. Storm warnings were placed for areas east of Lake Charles to Grand Isle, Louisiana and areas west of Sabine Pass to Velasco, Texas. Offshore vessels were also {{warned of the}} storm in areas between Bay St. Louis, Mississippi and Galveston, Texas. At the time, the hurricane was forecast to make landfall slightly east of Port Arthur, Texas. In Texas, these warnings were delivered to residents via factory whistles. <b>Evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> also began {{as a result of}} the approaching storm. The Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas and other nearby oil fields were evacuated. Coastal cities near Port Arthur, Texas were also evacuated by state highway police. Evacuees took shelter in refitted schools nearby. In the New Orleans, Louisiana area, several thousand residents were evacuated in advance of the storm. On Delacroix Island, Louisiana, 1,000residents evacuated. Rail and airline operations were halted as a precautionary measure, but were later resumed after the storm passed. All storm warnings were ceased by midnight on August8.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{potential}} impacts from Helene, the Weather Bureau began to advise prompt emergency evacuation in their advisories. Areas between Beaufort, South Carolina and Cape Fear, North Carolina were urged to begin <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> immediately. The Southeastern American Red Cross sent ten field staff warnings to locations in Georgia and South Carolina in order to assist in setting up emergency shelters. The Red Cross held 27hurricane preparation conferences to plan preparation procedures. Other civil defense organizations also mobilized hurricane preparation staff and equipment. The Weather Bureau sent a mobile weather station to Charleston, South Carolina in order to monitor weather conditions and alert surrounding populations with short-range radio equipment. Beaches on North Carolina's coast, including Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, were completely evacuated during the night of September27. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 100members of the United States National Guard were dispatched to monitor waterfront property, while 60others were kept on standby. Civilian vehicles attempting to enter Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were sent back by highway patrol 15mi (25km) outside the city borders, following an order issued by Governor of South Carolina George Bell Timmerman, Jr. The order was issued to minimize casualties and prevent looting. Approximately 100members of the National Guard and local police were kept to patrol the beach. Despite repeated orders for mandatory evacuation, a few people remained in Myrtle Beach. Civil Defense authorities forcibly evacuated stragglers, but others were permitted to remain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{emergency}} situation taking place inside a confined space, {{such as a}} building, is a challenging task due {{to the presence of}} dynamic conditions. Pervasive systems can prove beneficial for the <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure,</b> as they can provide directions to the evacuees regarding the best available exit. In this paper we describe two pervasive systems geared towards emergency support, which are deployed inside a building. Both systems use simple communications in order to collect and disseminate information regarding the best evacuation paths. We use a multi-agent simulation platform to demonstrate how the use of the systems improves the outcome of the <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Keywords-pervasive systems; emergency simulation; disaster management; building evacuation; opportunistic communications.

5|$|Due to the storm's slow {{movement}} just offshore the Louisiana coast, {{the hurricane}} became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements {{taken during the}} hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5in (953mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000mi2 (50,000km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1in (307.3mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76in (501.9mm) of precipitation fell on August9; the station would record 33.71in (856.2mm) of rain {{over the course of}} the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2ft (0.6m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21in (533mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé's Crevasse in 1927. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000acres (800,000hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October1940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{the post}} 9 / 11 era, {{emergency}} evacuation in large metropolitan areas {{has become a}} subject of national attention. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to simulate an emergency response to <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> in the downtown Baltimore, Maryland area. Proposed traffic modeling for simulating the response to emergency <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> {{in the case of a}} chemical disaster was designed to determine the most efficient response procedure. Using an integrated M&S framework, this paper seeks to describe the design of the Urban Chemical Disaster simulation. Included are the engineering considerations that led to the simulation flow structure using real-time and faster than real-time components. Components of chemical dispersion, chemical concentrations and wind transport media, chemical release rates, and sensing command/control simulations, are contributing factors to traffic flow manipulation. These manipulations will provide an effective emergency evacuation response method which could be used in the near future. A number of methodologies were posited by the research group to learn which could effectively mitigate a potential bioterrorist attack. Lessons learned in the collaboration along with feasible alternatives are discussed in further detail...|$|R

25|$|The early {{flight of}} Soviet {{officials}} {{who were supposed}} to manage the evacuation was roundly condemned by Soviet leaders, but often their retreat resulted from a realisation that <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedures</b> had started too late, {{and that there was no}} way to effectively execute it. Additionally, Soviet officials who remained in a city captured by German forces feared execution by Nazis on the hunt for communists. Avoiding that, the officials knew that they would be subject to intense interrogation as to what happened by suspicious Soviets upon returning to the fold.|$|E
