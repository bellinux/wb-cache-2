40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, udder health is {{associated}} with mastitis management, of which blanket <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> {{has been an important}} part for decades. To prevent the udder from new intramammary infections during the dry period, the use of blanket <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> has been advocated for more than 50 years as part of the five-point mastitis prevention program. The goal of <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> is to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections by eliminating infections already present at drying off and by preventing new infections from occurring during the dry period. Since 2012, preventive use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine is prohibited in the Netherlands. Therefore blanket <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> has been replaced by treatment of infected cows only, known as ‘selective dry cow treatment’. Although selection of cows {{is an important part of}} selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> and has a great effect on the consequences, not much research had been done in this field. Therefore it was considered valuable to evaluate the effect of various approaches to select cows for <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> on parameters such as udder health, antimicrobial use, and economics. Understanding and balancing these effects contributes to an optimal strategy in <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> and to prudent antimicrobial use in the dairy industry. The aims of this thesis were to quantify the effects of selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> on clinical and subclinical mastitis, antimicrobial use and economics. The effect of different somatic cell count threshold-scenarios for selecting cows for <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> on these parameters were evaluated. The economic consequences of using different numbers of dairy cows with antimicrobials at drying off, were evaluated as was the attitude of the dairy farmer and the veterinarian with respect to selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> and to reduction of antimicrobial use on dairy farms in general. This thesis shows that reduction of antimicrobial use at drying-off leads to an increased risk of mastitis at the individual level. The effect at the herd level was, however, very small. Criteria chosen to select cows for <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> had a limited effect on udder health, while the effect on the amount of antimicrobials used was large. Economics was found not to be an argument not to reduce the use of dry cow antimicrobials by applying selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment,</b> because in almost all scenarios selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> was economically beneficial over blanket <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment.</b> Application of selective <b>dry</b> cow <b>treatment</b> appeared to be associated with farmers’ and veterinarians’ attitude.

In 2003, a 27 % throughfall exclusion experiment was installed in a Quercus ilex L. forest in France. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were estimated in a control and a <b>dry</b> <b>treatment.</b> Decreasing throughfall decreased GPP by 14 % and had a smaller effect on R-ECO (- 12 %), especially soil respiration R-S (- 11 %). Interannual variability of GPP (29 %) was higher than for R-ECO (12 %). Error propagation was used to estimates uncertainties in the NEE fluxes, which ranged from 3 % to 10 % in the control treatment but up to 167 % for NEE in the <b>dry</b> <b>treatment</b> because more steps and data types were involved in the scaling. After 3 years of throughfall exclusion, we found no acclimation of R-S to climatic drivers. Functional properties of the response of R-S to soil water, temperature and rain pulse remained similar in the control and the dry treatments. A diurnal clockwise hysteresis in R-S was probably controlled by canopy photosynthesis with a 3 h lag. The proportion of diurnal variation of respiration due to photosynthesis was similar in all treatments (4 - 5 %). Because of the characteristic of rain in Mediterranean climates, a continuous decrease of water input in these environments have an effect on topsoil water and consequently on R-S only during short periods when rainfall is characterized by infrequent and small events that does not allow the topsoil to reach field capacity and does not allow to dry completely. However, in the longer term, we expect a stronger decrease in R-S in the <b>dry</b> <b>treatment</b> driven by the decrease in GPP...|$|E

By boiling treatment, tension wood with numerous G-fibers contracted considerably in the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal Young’s modulus decreased {{in spite of the}} water-saturated condition. The <b>drying</b> <b>treatment</b> caused green tension wood and boiled tension wood with numerous G-fibers to shrink longitudinally and increased their longitudinal Young’s moduli. These specific behaviors in tension wood were highly correlated with the proportion of G-fibers in a specimen and were probably caused by the microscopic behavior of cellulose microfibril (CMF) in the gelatinous layers (G-layers). The longitudinal shrinkage of tension wood due to drying suggests the existence of a hygro-sensible, noncrystalline region in the CMF, which is abundant in the G-layer. Furthermore, the noncrystalline region in the CMF softens during boiling treatment, resulting in the reduction of the longitudinal Young’s modulus in tension wood. The longitudinal contraction of tension wood with G-fibers by boiling might be caused by the tensile growth stress remaining in green G-layers.

The basic assumption is {{that the presence of}} one species (the facilitator) makes the growth of other species easier. In this study was determined based on the 5 years experiment, whether the interspecies interactions (i. e. the importance of facilitation and competition) changes according to the hydrological conditions. Three wetland species (Calamagrostis canescens, Carex elongata and Deschampsia cespitosa) were planted in experimental pots with the presence and absence of the dominant species (Carex elata). The hydrological gradient (= the stress gradient) was simulated by three types of hydrological conditions: dry, fluctuating and wet. The success of the species within the specific conditions was correlated with the fitness-related characteristics of the plants including the biomass, the number of ramets and the height of the plants. Following hypotheses were tested: i) at a low intensity of stress (with the wet treatment), the C. elata represents a competitor for other species. On the other hand, at a high intensity of stress (with the <b>dry</b> <b>treatment),</b> the C. elata represents a facilitator, making it easier to the other coexisting species to grow.

40|$|The paper compares {{sodium and}} calcium based sorbents for the <b>dry</b> <b>treatment</b> of flue gas from waste-to-energy plants {{with respect to}} their surface, {{reactivity}} to individual acid compounds in the flue gas and process conditions. The emphasis is on the dry flue gas treatment at temperatures below 250 °C. Commonly used stoichiometric dosages of sorbents are compared in relation to the mass of sorbent used. In addition, an experimental unit for testing of dry flue gas treatment is introduced...|$|E
40|$|The CLONIC ‘Closing the Nitrogen Cycle from Urban Landfill Leachate by Biological Nitrogen Removal over Nitrite and Thermal Treatment’ {{project is}} focused on {{nitrogen}} removal {{through the application of}} two biological processes: a partial nitritation of ammonia followed by an anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Finally, a thermal <b>dry</b> <b>treatment</b> closes the cycle. This CLONIC project workshop will present final results and will give researchers the opportunity to share their experiences in the field of nitrogen removalPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} role of nanostructured multilayer composite coatings (NMCC) deposited {{on the operating}} surfaces of replaceable faceted cutting inserts (CI) from cutting ceramics based on aluminum oxides with additives of titanium carbides is studied. It is shown that the developed NMCC not only raise substantially the endurance of the ceramic tools under high-speed <b>dry</b> <b>treatment</b> of quenched steels but also improve the quality and accuracy of processing of the parts and the ecological parameters of the cutting process...|$|E

These results indicate that it is feasible to estimate MOR based on Ed from non-destructive testing without conducting a destructive test to compute MOR directly.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dry</b> heat <b>treatment</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a method for disinfecting seed-borne pathogens in vegetable seeds. This study demonstrated that three seed-borne pathogens of cucumber (Cladosporium cucumerinum that causes scabs, Ascochyta citrullina that results in gummy stem blight, and Colletotrichum orbiculare that induces anthracnose) could be effectively eradicated from cucumber seeds by <b>dry</b> heat <b>treatment.</b> In vitro growth of these three pathogens was inhibited by <b>dry</b> heat <b>treatment</b> at 70 [*]°C for 40 [*]min. These pathogens were inactivated after exposing infected seeds to 70 [*]°C dry heat for at least 90 [*]min. Seed infection was significantly reduced by exposing the seeds to 70 [*]°C dry heat for at least 40 [*]min. Seed moisture content and germination were slightly reduced after 70 [*]°C heat treatment for 40 – 120 [*]min. Seed vigor remained at a high level after <b>dry</b> heat <b>treatment</b> at 70 [*]°C for 90 [*]min. In conclusion, 70 [*]°C <b>dry</b> heat <b>treatment</b> for 90 [*]min was determined to be the optimal method for eradication of C. cucumerinum, Didymella bryoniae, and C. orbiculare from cucumber seeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effects of <b>drying</b> <b>treatments</b> on anthocyanin, {{fumonisin}} B 1, aflatoxin B 1 {{content of}} anthocyanin extract from purple corn were evaluated {{based on the}} harvest of 2008 and 2009 in north China. The anthocyanin content of anthocyanin extract from husk was 62. 4 g/kg, being significant higher than that from cob and seed. The fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content of anthocyanin extract from the husk were 4. 25 and 5. 60 µg/kg, respectively, according with legislative limitation of USFDA. Moreover, the fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content of anthocyanin extract from the husk were lower than the maximum limitation of USFDA even after each <b>drying</b> <b>treatments.</b> Therefore, the husk of the purple corn in north China was feasible for anthocyanin production due to its high anthocyanin content and low fumonisin B 1 and aflatoxin B 1 content...|$|R
