40|$|Surgical {{infections are}} mostly polymicrobial, {{involving}} both aerobes and anaerobes. One hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n= 51), secondary peritonitis (n= 25), necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> (n= 22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n= 19) were studied. The number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2. 32). The aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0. 81 in secondary peritonitis and 1. 8 in necrotizing <b>fascitis.</b> Most secondary peritonitis (80 %), necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> (75 %) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66. 7 %) were polymicrobial. Common microorganisms isolated {{in our study}} were E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. The most effective antibiotics for S. aureus were clindamycin (79. 1 %) and cefuroxime (70. 8 %). For Gram-negatives (Klebsiella spp., E. coli and Proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35. 2 %) and ciprofloxacin (35. 2 %). The greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in P. aeruginosa (52. 9 %), followed by Klebsiella spp. (33. 3 %), Proteus spp. (33. 3 %), E. coli (22. 2 %), and S. aureus (12. 5 %). All the anaerobes that we isolated were 100 % sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95 % to 100 %).

40|$|Appendicectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{surgical}} procedures performed. Published literature shows that laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe procedure. A 35 year old female came to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain for the past few hours. History and examination revealed a classical case of acute appendicitis. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy the same night. Immediate post operative period was uneventful and she was discharged. But one day after her discharge she returned with vomiting, abdominal pain, swelling and tightness in the abdominal wall. Investigations revealed necrotising fasciitis and pericarditis. This case report shows that Laparoscopic appendicectomy can lead to unusual complications such as necrotising <b>fascitis</b> and pericarditis which cause significant postoperative morbidity. Therefore it can be concluded that it would be useful to use prophylactic antibiotics routinely preoperatively in cases of seemingly uncomplicated appendicitis to prevent infections like necrotising <b>fascitis.</b> It would also be beneficial to do preoperative ECG in all patients of suspected appendicitis so as to get a baseline ECG in persons with no known comorbidities...|$|E

Previous studies {{have been subject to}} significant selection bias since HBOT is not universally available at all medical centers and there is often considerable delay associated with its initiation. We examined the utility of HBOT for the treatment of NSTI in the modern era by isolating centers that have their own HBOT facilities. METHODS: We queried all centers in the University Health Consortium (UHC) database from 2008 to 2010 that have their own HBOT facilities (N= 14). Cases of NSTI were identified by ICD- 9 diagnosis codes, which included Fournier’s gangrene (608. 83), necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> (728. 86), and gas gangrene (040. 0). HBOT treatment status was identified by the presence (HBOT) or absence (CONTROL) of ICD- 9 procedure code (93. 95).

40|$|Introduction. Fournier's {{gangrene}} (FG) is a fulminant form of infective necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> of the perineal, genital, or perianal regions {{caused by}} anorectal or urogenital and perineal trauma, {{more common in}} patients with diabetes mellitus and alcohol misuse. Despite contemporary management, mortality is still high and averages 20 - 30 %. Case Outline. A 53 -year-old extremely obese diabetic postmenopausal woman {{with the history of}} poorly regulated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus lasting for 20 years, and gangrene followed by autoamputation of minor labia a year ago, was admitted due to severe suprapubic pain and septic fever. Gynaecological examination revealed suprapubic abscess spontaneously perforated few hours prior to admission. Contraincision was performed and purulent green-yellowish discharge appeared. Microbial evaluation of the obtained specimen identified Peptostreptoccocus, Enterococcus and E. coli. Antibiotics were administered according to the sensitivity test and suprapubic tumour formation was irrigated and drained. The procedure lasted seven days and resulted in the healing of the pathological process. Conclusion. FG is still a life-threatening condition; so, diagnosis should be prompt with early surgical intervention, along with antibiotics and good supportive care. Proactive management of the diabetic patient with perineal infections is of extreme importance, in order to prevent the development of FG, the entity associated with very high mortality.

In our environment, patients presenting with this infection are usually financially incapacitated and, therefore, their management can be challenging. This paper aimed {{to document the}} pattern and challenges encountered {{in the management of}} cervicofacial necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) in the University College Hospital, Ibadan. Materials and Methods: Information such as biodata, site of infection, systemic conditions, widest span of defect, management provided, hospital stay, and outcome of management was prospectively collected on all patients with CNF who presented at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between January 2007 and December 2013. The patients were managed according to a devised protocol of antibiotic therapy, serial debridement and honey dressings. Results: Twenty-four cases of CNF were seen. There were 9 males and 15 females while 70. 9 % of the patients belonged to the low socioeconomic class. The mean span of wound defect was 12. 2 (± 8. 844) cm. The mean hospital stay was 27. 8 (± 23. 1) days, and scar formation was the most common complication encountered. Conclusion: Our study represents the largest series of CNF from a Nigerian health facility presently. The management of necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> in the maxillofacial region poses a significant challenge to both the surgeon and the patient.

40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a painful}} condition caused by microtrauma to plantar fascia due to overuse. It {{is a most}} common cause of heel pain in runners. Various studies proved taping and Iontophoresis as effective in the treating plantar fasciitis. But there are no studies comparing the combined effect of iontophoresis with taping and taping alone in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods: 50 patients suffering from plantar fasciitis who met the inclusion criteria were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups i. e. Group A and Group B. Group A received taping, iontophoresis with plantar fascia stretching. Group B received taping and plantar fascia stretching. A total of 6 treatment sessions were given on alternate days over a period of two weeks for both the groups. Results: VAS and FFI scores across baseline and post intervention showed a significant improvement statistically in their mean scores between Groups A and B (P< 0. 05). Between group comparison of VAS and FFI scores, it showed that subject treated with Iontophoresis in combination with taping and plantar fascia stretch (Group A) had significant improvement in VAS and functional ability when compared to subjects treated with taping and plantar fascia stretching alone (Group B).

They have been occasionally reported {{as a cause of}} extra-intestinal infections such as cellulitis, cholangitis, necrotizing <b>fascitis,</b> meningitis, bacteremia, or peritonitis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Aim: To determine the role and possible pathogenesis of Aeromonas in extra-intestinal infections. Settings and Design: Retrospective analysis carried out at Kasturba Hospital Manipal, Karnataka in the months of January and February 2007. Materials and Methods: Clinical manifestations and management of eight cases of extra-intestinal infections caused by A. hydrophila, from the south Karnataka coastal region were reviewed. The isolates were identified with the help of biochemical tests using standard guidelines. Results: All patients acquired Aeromonas infections in the community. Five (62. 5 &#x 0025;) had underlying illnesses, such as liver disease, diabetes mellitus or malignancy. Five (62. 5 &#x 0025;) had polymicrobial infections, and three (37. 5 &#x 0025;) were complicated with bacteremia. These included three patients with ulcers or abscess over the lower leg, two with cellulitis due to snake bite and one each with pelvic inflammatory disease, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and pneumonia. A. hydrophila was found to be a causative agent of pelvic inflammatory disease or cellulitis following sea snake bite, and such a clinical scenario has not been previously described. Seven patients survived the illness. Conclusions: Isolation of A. hydrophila from extra-intestinal specimens demands utmost clinical and microbiological vigilance in diagnosis, since the organism can cause serious infections among immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent individuals...|$|E

Repeated injuries to the veins, injection of some types of insoluble substances, and needle sharing habits result in various complications. Increasing incidence of major vascular complications has been reported worldwide. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the epidemiology of vascular lesions in drug abusers. Medical records of 50 patients who were consecutively admitted to the surgical wards, presenting with a pulsatile mass, infection of the injection site, or venous thrombosis in the groin or cubital fossa were retrospectively reviewed. Of 50 patients studied, 88 % were males and 12 % were females. Most of the drug abusers were young. Eighty percent of the patients had an infected injection site in the groin, 12 % in the cubital fossa, and 8 % in other sites. Seventy-six percent of the patients had been injecting drugs for 10 years and the remaining 24 % for more than 10 years. Pseudo-aneurysm was the final diagnosis in 27 (54 %) patients. In females, the vascular lesions diagnosed were pseudo-aneurysm in four, deep venous thrombosis in one, and arterio-venous fistula in another patient. Among male patients, pseudo-aneurysm was present in 23 (52 %), venous thrombosis in eight (18 %), necrotizing <b>fascitis</b> in three (7 %), vascular abscess in two, and arterio-venous fistula in one (5 %).

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increase}} of severe invasive infections and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) with beta-haemolytic Group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS) has been reported from North-America and North-Western Europe. In the spring of 1992 several reports of cases suggested that this epidemic wave might have reached the Netherlands. Subsequently a national surveillance was initiated. Between 1 - 7 - 1992 and 31 - 12 - 1993 GAS-isolates from 440 patients {{were sent to the}} public health laboratory for typing; from 220 of those 440 patients (50 %) demographic and clinical data were obtained. In 132 of those 220 patients invasive infection with GAS was clinically and bacteriologically documented. Forty-one of those 132 patients (31 %) suffered from TSS. Cases were not associated with a particular geographical region. The incidence of TSS was highest in the age groups of 30 to 50 years and in individuals older than 60 years. Mortality associated with TSS was 51 %. In the majority of cases (61 %) no underlying diseases were reported. In 20 of the 41 TSS-cases no obvious portal of entry for infection was detected. In the remaining cases diverse primary local infections were observed. In 30 % of cases <b>fascitis</b> necroticans and/or myositis was present. In 11 % of cases TSS was acquired in the hospital. Type T 1 /M 1 was the etiological agent in 31 % of all (440) patients; none of the other 19 different T/M- types found contributed more than 10 %. T 1 /M 1 was strongly associated with TSS (22 of 41 cases, 54 %). Ninety-two percent of the T 1 /M 1 strains contained the bacteriophagelocated gene for exotoxine A.

40|$|The ideal {{prosthesis}} {{to replace}} the diseased human aortic valve is not yet available. We have previously shown that porcine acellular aortic-valve conduits, obtained by detergent-enzymatic method, display hemodynamic performances {{similar to those of}} their native counterparts. Hence, it seemed worthwhile to ascertain whether these tissue-engineered prostheses can be successfully xenotransplanted. Porcine acellular conduits, which immunocytochemistry demonstrated to lack MHC class I and II antigens, were implanted in the thoracic aorta of 9 sheep. Two animals died just after surgery, and the other 7 sheep were sacrificed 1 or 5 months after transplantation. A rather favorable outcome of the implant was observed in 4 sheep. In these animals, aortic valves remained pliable and coaptive, and the luminal surface of the conduits was endothelized just after one month from surgery. An intense inflammatory response was present at 1 month, and, although attennuated, it persisted for 5 months, located mainly between the tunica intima and media and at the border of the implant. Vimentin-positive and smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts proliferated within tunica media and adventitia, and an obvious thickening of the tunica intima was also observed. Small vessels were seen in the adventitia, and elastic fibers were well-preserved in both the aorta wall and valve leaflets. In the cases of unfavorable outcome (3 of 7 survived sheep), implants were detached from the aorta recipient and surrounded by a connective mass that almost completely obstructed their lumen. These masses were composed of a fibromyxoid background where proliferating cells, resembling those occurring in human reactive myofibroblastic lesions (proliferative <b>fascitis),</b> were embedded. Collectively, these rather disappointing findings indicate that acellular valve conduits, obtained by the detergent-enzymatic method, are presently not suitable for clinical applications because of the persistent inflammatory response, which conceivably triggers overgrowth mechanisms that lead to implant failure...|$|E

The projectile generates stress waves in the applicator that transmit as pressure waves into tissue. The acoustic fields from two applicators were measured: one applicator was 15 mm in diameter and the surface slightly convex and the second was 12 mm in diameter the surface was concave. Measurements were made in a water tank and both applicators generated a similar pressure pulse consisting of a rectangular positive phase (4 micros duration and up to 8 MPa peak pressure) followed by a predominantly negative tail (duration of 20 micros and peak negative pressure of - 6 MPa), with many oscillations. The rise times of the waveforms were around 1 micros and were shown to be too long for the pulses to be considered shock waves. Measurements of the field indicated that region of high pressure was restricted to the near-field (20 - 40 mm) of the source and was consistent with the Rayleigh distance. The measured acoustic field did not display focusing supported by calculations, which demonstrated that the radius of curvature of the concave surface was too large to effect a focusing gain. Other SWT devices use electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric sources that do result in focused shock waves. This difference in the acoustic fields means there is potentially a significant mechanistic difference between a ballistic source and other SWT devices...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bacterial and viral etiologies {{are most}} {{commonly}} blamed for ocular infections. Studies {{have shown that}} gram positive cocci are responsible for maximum number of infections, followed by anaerobic bacteria and gram negative bacilli. Infections of the ocular adnexa, ocular surface and orbit usually present as conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, orbital cellulitis and periorbital necrotising <b>fascitis.</b> The intra-ocular infections usually occur subsequently to a corneal ulcer, penetrating eye injury or a severe blood stream infection, and presents as iritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. The aim {{of the study was}} to find out the clinico-demographic profile of patients who were diagnosed to have ocular infections at a large tertiary care teaching hospital in south India. Methods: A retrospective study was designed to include all patients who came with suspected ocular infections to the out-patient department (OPD) of Pushpagiri Medical College Hospital, Thiruvalla, Kerala, India, from July 2015 to December 2015. Results: More than 50 % of the participants reported ocular pain and around 60 % has redness of the affected eye. Twenty five percent of the participants had discharge from the eyes and 56. 7 % reported persistent watering. Around 60 % of the patients had irritation of the eye, while only 16. 7 % said that they feel blurring of vision. The final diagnosis was formed after careful examination by the senior most consultants available at the OPD and relevant investigations. Among the participants, 36. 6 % had conjunctivitis and 16. 6 % had corneal ulceration due to an infective cause. Around 13 % has corneal abrasion, 11. 6 % had foreign body, 3 % had dry eye and 3 % had dacrocystitis. Conclusions: Only around 55 % of the patients with suspected eye infections turned out to be actual infections and a vast majority of that was due to conjunctivitis. Though majority of the patients presented with pain, redness, watering and discharge, these symptoms/signs cannot be used to differentiate infective etiology from a non-infective one.

40|$|U radu autori opisuju i objašnjavaju nastanak bolnih sindroma u području potkoljenice i stopala, vezanih uz profesiju odnosno sportsku aktivnost. Iznose se zapažanja i iskustva iz svakodnevne liječničke prakse, a i podaci iz novije medicinske literature. Značenje se daje liječenju koje je obično konzervativno, a od kirurških metoda naglasak se daje na nove manje invazivne metode. U radu su opisani najčešći sindromi prenaprezanja u području potkoljenice kao što su trkačka potkoljenica, sindrom stražnjega tibijalnog mišića, kronični sindrom prednjega fascijalnog prostora, sindrom prenaprezanja Ahilove tetive, entezitis Ahilove tetive, retrokalkanearni burzitis te ruptura Ahilove tetive. U području stopala opisani su kao najčešći sindromi prenaprezanja plantarni <b>fascitis,</b> {{tendinitis}} stražnjega tibijalnog mišića, tendinitis dugog fleksora palca, tendinitis ekstenzora prstiju i prednji i stražnji sindrom sraza gornjeg nožnoga zgloba. The lower leg, {{foot and}} ankle form a functional {{unit of the}} locomotor system with an important static and dynamic function. Injury or loss of function of any muscle group of the lower leg and the foot influences normal gait or impedes standing. Increased or frequent loads on the muscle group may lead to pain syndromes known as overuse syndromes or overuse injuries. Athletes and certain professions involving standing or walking {{for a long time}} are especially susceptible to increased muscle strains. This article describes and clarifies the causes and the development of the pain syndromes in the lower leg, foot and ankle associated with certain professions or sports. The description of anatomical relationships and functions of individual muscle groups is here to clarify the occurrence of overuse injuries which may involve the muscle itself, the tendon, or the point of their attachment to the bone. The article describes observations and experiences from everyday clinical practice, but it also summarises results described in recent publications. The focus is also put on the therapy, which is usually conservative. Particular mention is given to new non-invasive surgical techniques. The article describes the most common overuse injuries of the lower leg such as shin splints, tibialis posterior syndrome, chronic anterior compartment syndrome, overuse injury of the Achilles tendon, enthesitis of the tendo Achilles, retrocalcanear bursitis and rupture of the Achilles tendon. In the foot area the most frequent overuse syndromes are the plantar fasciitis, tibialis posterior tendinitis, tendinitis of the long flexor of the toe, toe extensor tendinitis, and also anterior and posterior impingement syndromes of the ankle...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fascial space infections of {{the head}} and neck region, usually odontogenic in origin, are {{routinely}} treated as an out-patient procedure. Untreated or rapidly spreading odontogenic infections can be potentially life threatening. The present study is a review of patients with orofacial infections who required emergent incision and drainage in the maxillofacial unit of our institution. The need for early presentation is highlighted. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with orofacial space infections between January 2007 and December 2010. Patients′ case files were retrieved and demographic as well as clinical characteristics were obtained and analyzed. A P value of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 53 patients with fascial space infection were seen over the period of study. Of the 41 patients reviewed, males accounted for 26 (63. 4 %) and females 15 (36. 6 %). Their ages ranged from 4 months to 80 years (mean 32. 8 ± 18. 3 years). There was no statistical difference between the mean age of male and female patients (t=- 962, P= 0. 342). Submandibular space was the most frequently involved single space and accounted for 43. 9 % of the cases. This was followed by multiple space involvement (Ludwig angina) which accounted for 36. 6 %. Buccal space and submasseteric space infection represented 7. 3 % each. Sources of infections were of odontogenic origin in 92. 7 % of cases and were unknown in the remaining 7. 3 %. The outcome was satisfactory with complete resolution in 48. 8 % of cases. Resolution with some morbidities in the form of persistent limitation of mouth opening, orocutaneus fistula, and necrotising <b>fascitis</b> were seen in an almost equal proportion of 46. 3 % of cases. The outcome was observed to be significantly associated with the presence of underlying systemic conditions (χ 2 = 21. 66; r= 0. 73; P= 0. 0001), time of presentation (χ 2 = 12. 28; r= 0. 55; P= 0. 002), and age (χ 2 = 54. 48; r= 0. 69; P= 0. 0001). Conclusion: Fascial space infections {{of the head}} and neck region, though potentially life threatening, can be prevented by regular dental visits. Early recognition and treatment of established cases are necessary to prevent considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients with an underlying systemic condition...|$|E
