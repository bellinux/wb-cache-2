5|$|Orešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not {{primarily}} {{produced by the}} choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, {{as a consequence of}} water filtration through the capillary walls into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid.</b> This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> diffuse into the {{epithelial}} cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E

The research activities of the URL are dedicated to reversible, deep geological disposal of high-activity, long-lived radioactive wastes in an argillaceous host rock. The target horizon for the URL is a 130 -m-thick layer of argillaceous rocks that lies at about 420 to 550 m below ground level. One of the major aspects covered by the experimental work in the URL concerns the characterization of the confining properties of the rock. These confining properties come from the physical characteristics of the rock and the physico-chemical characteristics of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> and their interaction with the rock. One of the fundamental physical characteristics is permeability. This property is studied through various specific tests. The chemical characteristics of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> condition the mobility of the various radionuclides likely {{to be found in the}} natural environment. This mobility depends on the radionuclide diffusion and retention properties in this argillaceous rock. Dedicated in situ experiments focus on knowledge of the geochemistry of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> and on the diffusion and retention capabilities of the radionuclides.

50|$|In {{humans and}} related organisms, {{there are five}} major body compartments: the blood plasma, <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids,</b> fat tissues, {{intracellular}} fluids, and transcellular fluids, the latter of which includes fluids in the pleural (peritoneal) cavity.

25|$|The {{continuity}} between the brain <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> and the CSF {{was confirmed by}} H. Cserr and colleagues from Brown University and Kings College London. The same group postulated that interstitial solutes in the brain parenchyma exchange with CSF via a bulk flow mechanism, rather than diffusion. However other work from this same lab indicated that the exchange of CSF with <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> was inconsistent and minor, contradicting the findings of Grady and colleagues.|$|E

50|$|Fatty acids are {{oxidized}} {{by most of}} {{the tissues}} in the body. However, some tissues such as the red blood cells (which do not contain mitochondria), and cells of the central nervous system (because fatty acids cannot cross the blood-brain barrier into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> that bathe these cells) do not use fatty acids for their energy requirements, but instead use carbohydrates or ketone bodies.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{dilution}} of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> on the responsiveness of the toad urinary bladder to antidiuretic hormones has been examined in vivo and in vitro. Toads were given periodic injections with vasopressin while in water {{so that their}} plasma osmolality fell below 190 mosmoles/kg H 20. The hydraulic conductivity of bladders which {{had been removed from}} the animal and fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde was 10 -fold less in overhydrated toads than in normally hydrated controls. A similar inhibitory phenomenon was observed in in vitro studies, when the tonicity of Ringer's fluid in which the bladders were suspended was lowered from its isotonic value. Mannitol, but not urea, could be effectively substituted for one-half of the NaC 1 content of Ringer's fluid. In other experiments {{it has been shown that}} the responsiveness of the bladder to vasotocin is depressed during bulk water movement across the tissue. This "flux inhibition " was found to depend upon the velocity and the duration of water flow from mucosa to the serosa. It is suggested that the responsiveness of the toad bladder to antidiuretic hormones diminishes as the effective osmotic pressure of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> declines...|$|R

5000|$|The {{net effect}} {{of all of these}} {{processes}} is that water moves out of and back into the capillary, while the crystalloid substances in the capillary and <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> equilibrate. Since the capillary fluid is constantly and rapidly renewed by the flow of the blood, its composition dominates the equilibrium concentration that is achieved in the capillary bed. This ensures that the watery environment of the body’s cells is always close to their ideal environment (set by the body’s homeostats).|$|R
25|$|While humans, as well {{as other}} vertebrates, have a closed {{cardiovascular}} system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system.

40|$|SUMMARY: Phosphorite concretions, fish debris, quartz, rock {{fragments}} and minor amounts of molluscs occur {{along the eastern}} edge of a diatomaceous mud belt off the coast of SW Africa (Namibia). The concretions consist of light- and dark-coloured coprolites and dreikanters, predominantly of pebble and granule size; and irregular, tabular, and oval to spherical particles that predominante in the granule to very coarse sand fractions. Only the dark-coloured concretions were analysed geochemically, and these consist of francolite with minor amounts of Si, AI, Fe and K. The most abundant trace elements present are Sr, Zn, Ba and Th. The <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> of the diatomaceous mud are supersaturated in phosphate along the landward flank of the mud belt, and this causes slow precipitation of apatite on diatom frustules. Concurrently, the fluids enhance the elimination or replacement of allogenic im-purities from the concretions through diagenesis. Adsorption of phosphate by slow-settling mica-illite is a Dossible mechanism bv which the phosphate concentration of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> is raised.

25|$|Lymphedema, {{also known}} as {{lymphoedema}} and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> to the thoracic duct, then the bloodstream.

Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can ameliorate symptoms. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|The lymphatic vessels, {{also called}} lymph vessels, conduct lymph between {{different}} parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of the lymph capillaries, and the larger collecting vessels–the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the subclavian veins. These vessels are also called the lymphatic channels or simply lymphatics.|$|E
25|$|The Paradigm system {{consists}} of two basic parts: an insulin pump and an optional glucose sensor CGM worn for up to 3 days. The disposable sensor is subcutaneously-placed to make glucose measurements in <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> every 5 minutes and transmit the reading via {{low power radio frequency}} (ISM band) to the pump for realtime display. However, insulin therapy may be conducted without CGM and although there is not yet an automated insulin-regulation feedback mechanism between measure and infusion to control the amount and timing of insulin, this is clearly a future objective. So any change in basal or bolus is patient-driven by programming the pump using the Bolus WizardTM. The latest model pumps are the MiniMed Paradigm 522 and 722 which differ in reservoir size, 176 versus 300 units, respectively. In 2007 the FDA approved a pediatric model for patients 7 to 17 years old.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the CSF is formed in the choroid plexus and flows through the brain along a distinct pathway: moving through the cerebral ventricular system, into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, then draining into the systemic blood column via arachnoid granulations of the dural sinuses or to peripheral lymphatics along cranial nerve sheathes. Many researchers {{have suggested that the}} CSF compartment constitutes a sink for interstitial solute and fluid clearance from the brain parenchyma. However, the distances between the <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluid</b> and the CSF in the ventricles and subarachnoid space are too great for the efficient removal of interstitial macromolecules and wastes by simple diffusion alone. Helen Cserr at Brown University calculated that mean diffusion times for large molecules such as albumin would exceed 100hrs to traverse 1cm of brain tissue, a rate that is not compatible with the intense metabolic demands of brain tissue. A clearance system based on simple diffusion would additionally lack the sensitivity to respond rapidly to deviations from homeostatic conditions.|$|E

40|$|From {{the data}} given above the {{following}} {{explanation of the}} effects of continued loss of the external secretion of the pancreas may be offered. The underlying event is a steadily increasing deficit of sodium and of chloride ion due to the large requirement for these electrolytes in the construction of pancreatic juice. In consequence there is continued loss of water, chiefly from the body fluids in which sodium and chloride ion are large factors of total ionic content, viz., <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids</b> and the blood plasma. During about two-thirds of the survival period the volume and composition of the blood plasma remain approximately normal, the losses of water, sodium, and chloride ion being replaced at the expense of <b>interstitial</b> <b>fluids.</b> Reduction of the volume of these fluids is indicated by loss of body weight beginning directly after establishment of the pancreatic fistula. Ultimately reduction of plasma volume begins and, as it progresses, serious symptoms develop and death occurs unless water, sodium, and chloride ion are abundantly replaced. Owing to the relatively greater loss of sodium than of chloride ion in pancreatic juice, reduction of bicarbonate ion concentration in the plasma tends to occur. The death of the organism may be simply and reasonably explained as the result of progressive impairment of the function of the blood by the physical changes, dehydration and acidosis, produced in the plasma by the continued loss of sodium and of chloride ion in the pancreatic juice...|$|R
