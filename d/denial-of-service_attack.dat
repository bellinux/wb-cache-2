5|$|August 6, 2009: Twitter and Facebook {{suffered}} from a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack,</b> causing the Twitter website to go offline for several hours. It was later confirmed that the attacks were directed at one pro-Georgian user around {{the anniversary of the}} 2008 South Ossetia War, rather than the sites themselves.|$|E
5|$|During the January 2006 auction, {{the website}} {{was subject to}} a {{distributed}} <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> (DDoS) and ransom demand, which left it inaccessible to visitors for a week while its security system was upgraded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wiltshire Constabulary investigated the attack and extortion attempt.|$|E
40|$|<b>Denial-of-Service</b> <b>attacks</b> and Distributed <b>Denial-of-Service</b> <b>attacks</b> {{are serious}} {{security}} problems over the Internet {{due to their}} nature. They are easy to implement, hard to prevent, and very difficult to trace. This paper describes <b>Denial-of-Service</b> <b>attacks</b> and Distributed <b>Denial-of-Service</b> <b>attacks</b> and presents various traceback that are proposed to identify the sources of theses attackers in the Internet. Finally it gives formal specifications for a class of these traceback protocols called marking protocols...|$|R
25|$|<b>Denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> (DoS attacks) {{have forced}} web sites to close after a {{malicious}} attack, flooding the site with more requests than it could cope with. Viruses {{have also been}} used to co-ordinate large scale distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Robust random early {{detection}} (RRED) {{algorithm was proposed}} to improve the TCP throughput against <b>Denial-of-Service</b> (DoS) <b>attacks,</b> particularly Low-rate <b>Denial-of-Service</b> (LDoS) <b>attacks.</b> Experiments have confirmed that the existing RED-like algorithms are notably vulnerable under Low-rate <b>Denial-of-Service</b> (LDoS) <b>attacks</b> due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks. RRED algorithm can significantly improve the performance of TCP under Low-rate <b>Denial-of-Service</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
5|$|On June 15, LulzSec {{launched}} {{an attack on}} cia.gov, the public website of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, taking the website offline for several hours with a distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> On December 2, an offshoot of LulzSec calling itself LulzSec Portugal attacked several sites related {{to the government of}} Portugal. The websites for the Bank of Portugal, the Assembly of the Republic, and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Development all became unavailable for a few hours.|$|E

50|$|Distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> on root nameservers are Internet {{events in}} which {{distributed}} <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> target {{one or more}} of the thirteen Domain Name System root nameserver clusters. The root nameservers are critical infrastructure components of the Internet, mapping domain names to IP addresses and other resource record (RR) data.|$|R
25|$|On December 25, 2014, both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live {{suffered}} network disruption after a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> Functionality {{was restored}} on December 28, with some users experiencing {{difficulties in the}} days that followed.|$|E
25|$|The shrew {{attack is}} a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> on the Transmission Control Protocol. It uses short {{synchronized}} bursts of traffic to disrupt TCP connections {{on the same}} link, by exploiting a weakness in TCP's retransmission timeout mechanism.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June, LulzSec {{launched}} {{an attack on}} , the public website of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, taking the website offline with a distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> The website was down from 5:48pm to 8:00pm eastern time.|$|E

25|$|In European countries, {{committing}} criminal <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> may, as a minimum, lead to arrest. The United Kingdom {{is unusual}} in that it specifically outlawed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison with the Police and Justice Act 2006, which amended Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.|$|R
40|$|Denial of Service (DoS) aims {{to drain}} the {{underlying}} resources of a service and is a increasing problem for today’s service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation based proof-of-work (RB-PoW) protocol based on adaptive scaling of puzzle difficulties to mitigate various <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks.</b> A testing framework was developed to examine RB-PoW’s effectiveness against classical PoW protocols in simulated DoS attacks. We concluded that in flooding type of <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> the RBPoW model is superior to the classical PoW that is based solely on server load. Both offer similar performance when exposed to drain-type <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R
25|$|A Nuke {{is an old}} <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> against {{computer}} networks consisting of fragmented or otherwise invalid ICMP packets sent to the target, achieved by using a modified ping utility to repeatedly send this corrupt data, thus slowing down the affected computer until {{it comes to a}} complete stop.|$|E
25|$|If an {{attacker}} mounts {{an attack}} {{from a single}} host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack against availability would be classed as a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> In {{this kind of}} attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|E

25|$|Although Scroogle's {{activities}} technically violated Google's {{terms of}} service, Google generally tolerated its existence, whitelisting the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running {{into a series}} of problems starting in 2010. In February 2012, the service was permanently shut down by its creator due to a combination of throttling of search requests by Google and a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> by an unknown person or group.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 2016, Drudge Report {{accused the}} United States federal {{government}} {{of attempting to}} shut down its website with a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> Beginning roughly one week earlier, DDoS attacks had repeatedly taken the site offline for extended periods. Cybersecurity analysts speculated that the attack was {{on the scale of}} the 2016 Dyn cyberattack and suggested that {{only a small number of}} groups would have the ability to take down a highly-trafficked site for extended lengths of time.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions {{and access to}} databases. It requires less resources and often accompanies network layer attacks. An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets. The attack on the {{application layer}} can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search function as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. In order to be deemed a distributed denial of service attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer than 3–5 nodes qualifies as a <b>Denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> and not a DDoS.|$|E

50|$|The <b>attacks</b> {{involved}} <b>Denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks.</b> The New York Times {{reported on}} 12 August {{that according to}} some experts, {{it was the first}} time in history a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war. On 12 August, the attacks continued, controlled by programs that were located in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications companies. A Russian-language site, stopgeorgia.ru, continued to operate and offer software for <b>Denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{shows that}} the {{security}} challenges posed by the 802. 11 wireless networks are manifold and it is therefore important to explore the various vulnerabilities that are present with such networks. Along with other security vulnerabilities, defense against <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> is {{a critical component of}} any security system. Unlike in wired networks where <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> have been extensively studied, {{there is a lack of}} research for preventing such attacks in wireless networks. In addition to various vulnerabilities, some factors leading to different types of <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attacks</b> and some defense mechanisms are discussed in this chapter. This can help to better understand the wireless network vulnerabilities and subsequently more techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed by researchers...|$|R
25|$|In October 2011, a {{research}} team from ESIEA {{claimed to have}} discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack.</b> A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating that these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|Kaspersky Lab {{experts at}} first {{estimated}} that Stuxnet started spreading around March or April 2010, {{but the first}} variant of the worm appeared in June 2009. On 15 July 2010, the day the worm's existence became widely known, a distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> was made on the servers for two leading mailing lists on industrial-systems security. This attack, from an unknown source but likely related to Stuxnet, disabled one of the lists and thereby interrupted {{an important source of}} information for power plants and factories. On the other hand, researchers at Symantec have uncovered a version of the Stuxnet computer virus that was used to attack Iran's nuclear program in November 2007, being developed as early as 2005, when Iran was still setting up its uranium enrichment facility.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter the}} virus' use of {{pseudorandom}} domain names, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and several TLD registries began in February 2009 a coordinated barring of transfers and registrations for these domains. Variant D counters this by generating daily {{a pool of}} 50,000 domains across 110 TLDs, from which it randomly chooses 500 to attempt for that day. The generated domain names were also shortened from 8–11 to 4–9 characters {{to make them more}} difficult to detect with heuristics. This new pull mechanism (which was disabled until April 1, 2009) is unlikely to propagate payloads to more than 1% of infected hosts per day, but is expected to function as a seeding mechanism for the virus' peer-to-peer network. The shorter generated names, however, are expected to collide with 150–200 existing domains per day, potentially causing a distributed <b>denial-of-service</b> <b>attack</b> (DDoS) on sites serving those domains. However the large number of generated domains and the fact that not every domain will be contacted for a given day will probably prevent DDoS situations.|$|E
