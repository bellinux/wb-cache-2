25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} Williamson met his main stylistic influence, Raymond: [...] "I {{had just turned}} 18. I {{had been in the}} {{business}} about six months or so. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> about two hours." ...|$|E

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> his demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So I took it to Faith. Faith loved it, she said she'd been looking for Nas {{for a year and a}} half. They wouldn't let me leave the office without a deal on the table." ...|$|E

500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over my head, on the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his {{worldwide}} movement was valued in the billions of dollars. The ashram, built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park, was reclaimed by the government in the mid-1990s after the lease expired in 1981, and fell into disrepair. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: [...] "my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly {{for the people of the}} world and the cause of unity". Starr said in 2008, [...] "I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi– <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a mantra that no one can take away, and I still use it". In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan, and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying: [...] "John would have been the first one now, if he had been here, to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it". Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon [...] "benefited from the experience" [...] and [...] "for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
