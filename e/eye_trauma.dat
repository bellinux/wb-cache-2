5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including <b>eye</b> <b>trauma,</b> disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E

Stimulated by interleukin 23 (IL-23), T helper 17 cells and cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL-17) appear to target proteins in the melanocyte.|$|E

Examinations revealed a ruptured globe with vitreous haemorrhage and an intraocular glass foreign body in the left eye. Primary repair was done with good post operative visual recovery.

The difference between the duration of coming life of country population and the patient’ age were used as the gauge of life duration associated with disablement {{at the moment of}} the primary recognition by an invalid.  It was determined that the middle duration of coming life associated with disablement changed and shook in the groups from 11, 31  to 36, 37 years for men and from 17, 58 to 42, 37 years for women subject to the reason of disablement.  It is considered that the middle duration of coming life associated with disablement is integral criterion for an estimation of the medico-social burden of disease. It is differed 3 degrees of heaviness of the medico-social burden. The moderate heaviness of the medico-social burden (the middle duration of coming lif associated with disablement less than 20 years) is characteristic for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and uveitis and the high degree of heaviness (the middle duration of coming life associated with disablement more than 30 years) for disease of eyeball, visual nerve, <b>eye</b> <b>traumas,</b> myopia and anophthalmia. </p...|$|R

The serum, aqueous humor and tear IL- 2, sIL- 2, NO, TAC, and SOD of two groups were detected and compared, and the detection levels {{of patients with}} different stages were compared.
