5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrive at}} the police station to see Billy. Doggett {{interviews}} the boy, who seems to be mute. In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy.

They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children.

Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, [...] "I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!" [...] He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.|$|E
500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E

500|$|Sergeant Yates, still undercover, seeks {{employment}} with Butters. But Keyshawn soon appears {{outside and}} begs for [...] "Yolanda" [...] back, asking {{for her hand}} in marriage. Butters insists that he cannot force [...] "Yolanda" [...] to work for him, claiming it would interfere with the [...] "true love" [...] Keyshawn and [...] "Yolanda" [...] share. [...] "Yolanda" [...] accepts the proposal, and Butters decides to quit {{his job as a}} pimp. To the delight of his employees, he encourages them to function under the self-management of the company so they can keep whatever they earn for themselves. While [...] "Yolanda" [...] and Keyshawn are shown celebrating their first anniversary together in a small chalet in the mountains in Switzerland, Yates suddenly decides to spring his sting operation.

500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement {{about whether or not the}} war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> the rug, reminding us that the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid a great deal of attention to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another {{situation}} involving sibling rivalries, David {{is confronted}} by James, who he blames for {{being taken away}} from their mother and being consigned to a worse life with King George. After James knocks David out by using his stun gun, he tricks his niece Emma and Robin Hood to lead him to Zelena's baby. James reveals himself when they reach the rendezvous point, after slapping an anti-magic cuff on Emma, and is joined by Cruella, who is {{still looking for a}} way to escape the Underworld, by stealing Zelena's baby for leverage with Hades. When Cruella and James enter the harbor, as part of their plan to send Emma and Robin to their deaths, David and Hook arrive to rescue Emma and Robin, before it's too late. Hook grabs the gun dropped by James and removed the cuffs from Emma, and Cruella runs back to safety. Meanwhile, David attempts to help James move on while confronting him, as James continues to believe that killing David is the [...] "unfinished business" [...] that is keeping him in the Underworld. After David's plea to help James falls on deaf ears, the twins continue fighting each other on the edge of the dock, with David wanting the others to stay out of the struggle. As James begins to lose, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a boot knife, despite David's pleas to stop. David eventually twists James off into the River of Lost Souls, condemning him to eternal torment, while Cruella flees the scene. Emma tells her father that there was nothing he could do to save James, despite his best efforts, and that some people just won't ever move on.|$|E
