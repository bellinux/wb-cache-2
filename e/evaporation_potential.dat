50|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (PET) is {{the amount}} of water that would be evaporated and transpired if there were sufficient water available. This demand incorporates the energy available for evaporation and the ability of the lower atmosphere to transport evaporated moisture away from the land surface. Potential evapotranspiration is higher in the summer, on less cloudy days, and closer to the equator, because of the higher levels of solar radiation that provides the energy for <b>evaporation.</b> <b>Potential</b> evapotranspiration is also higher on windy days because the evaporated moisture can be quickly moved from the ground or plant surface, allowing more evaporation to fill its place.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvaporation, {{which is}} an {{important}} factor in the water balance at the basin scale, is a critical variable in the determination of local available water resources. Since the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> is mainly influenced by meteorological variables, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which different meteorological variables affect the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The aim of this study was to explore the variation trends of different meteorological variables, and their impacts on the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation.</b> This study selected the Hailar Meteorological Station of the Hailar region, which is situated in a cold, semi-arid, and sub-humid region, as a case study site. Based on observed daily meteorological data from 1951 to 2009, the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> was calculated with the Penman formula, and the variations of meteorological variables were investigated with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. The correlation between the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and each meteorological variable at annual and seasonal scales was also analyzed. The results show that the annual and seasonal <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and air temperature present increasing trends, whereas the wind speed, sunshine duration, and relative humidity present decreasing trends. Among the meteorological variables, the air temperature and relative humidity are the key factors that affect <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> at different time scales, and the impacts of other meteorological variables on the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> are not significant and vary with time scales...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{first part}} of this paper compares two {{algorithms}} relating daily <b>evaporation</b> to <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and simulated soil water content. The first algorithm assumes that the ratio of actual to <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> is a single-valued function of water content. The second algorithm, which appears to be conceptually superior, determines the actual evaporation as the smaller of the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and a rate determined by the soil water content. The comparison is based on evaporation data from a deep weighing lysimeter, and soil water data obtained by a neutron moisture meter, the vegetation being a deep-rooted pasture grass. Although there is considerable scatter in the results, the second algorithm performs slightly better than the first. The second part of the paper examines the hypothesis that runoff is only marginally affected by day-to-day variations in evaporation, and thus average monthly <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> data can be used in place of daily data as a model input. Results from 4 models applied to data for 15 Australian benchmark catchments suggest this hypothesis is correct, and furthermore that for some catchments the best fit of all models to runoff data is obtained with unrealistically high values of <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation...</b>|$|R

This study uses a two factor design (temperature and humidity) to investigate volumetric performance (precision and trueness) at environmental conditions from 15 ?C to 30 ?C and 30 % to 80 % relative humidity. Nine environmental conditions were tested, the mid point, four corner cases and four edge cases. Replicate testing was performed at the mid point and corner cases. The Tecan QC Kit, {{which is based on}} Artel?s ratiometric photometry, was used to make measurements at each set of environmental conditions. The precision (%CV), and trueness (%SE) is reported for each environmental condition using default liquid classes. The precision of the Tecan Freedom EVO was found to be insensitive to environmental conditions and performed within manufacturer?s limits over the entire range tested in this study (15 ?C to 30 ?C and 30 % to 80 % relative humidity). Over the range of this test, the trueness (systematic error) does depend on environmental conditions. Increased temperature and decreased relative humidity resulted in lower delivered volume. For the greatest accuracy in laboratory work, and particularly when operated outside of recommended temperatures, the automated liquid handling system should be tested and optimized for the local environment. The environmental effect on trueness exhibited a linear correlation with the ?<b>evaporation</b> <b>potential?</b> (the driving force for evaporation of the sample). The <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> is dependent on both temperature and relative humidity.

The correlation of <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> with the monitored meteorological factors including the water vapor pressure difference, air water temperature difference, air temperature, and wind speed, was analyzed. The applicability of the Dalton model corrected with air water temperature difference and believed to be universal for use in China was examined.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and actual evaporation was first examined by Bouchet (Proc Berkeley Calif Symp IAHS Publ, 62 : 134 - 142, 1963) who considered <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> as {{the consequence of}} regional evaporation due to atmospheric feedbacks. Using a heuristic approach, he derived a complementary relationship which, despite no real theoretical background, {{has proven to be}} very useful in interpreting many experimental data under various climatic conditions. Here, the {{relationship between}} actual and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> is reinterpreted {{in the context of the}} development of the convective boundary layer (CBL) : first, with a closed-box approach, where the CBL has an impermeable lid; and then with an open system, where air is exchanged between the CBL and its external environment. By applying steady forcing to these systems, it is shown that an equilibrium state is reached, where <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> has a specific equilibrium formulation as a function of two parameters: one representing large-scale advection and the other the feedback effect of regional <b>evaporation</b> on <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation,</b> i. e. a kind of "medium-scale advection". It is also shown that the original form of Bouchet's complementary relationship is not verified in the equilibrium state. This analysis leads us to propose a new and more rational approach of the relationship between <b>potential</b> and actual <b>evaporation</b> through the effective surface resistance of the region...|$|R
40|$|Transpiration is {{commonly}} conceptualised as {{a fraction of}} some potential rate, driven by so-called "atmospheric evaporative demand". Therefore, atmospheric evaporative demand or "potential evaporation" is generally used alongside with precipitation and soil moisture to characterise the environmental conditions that affect plant water use. Consequently, an increase in <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> (e. g. due to climate change) is believed to cause increased transpiration and/or vegetation water stress. In the present study, we investigated the question whether <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> constitutes a meaningful reference for transpiration and compared sensitivity of <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> and leaf transpiration to atmospheric forcing. A physically-based leaf energy balance model was used, considering the dependence of feedbacks between leaf temperature and exchange rates of radiative, sensible and latent heat on stomatal resistance. Based on modelling results and supporting experimental evidence, we conclude that stomatal resistance cannot be parameterised as a factor relating transpiration to <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation,</b> as the ratio between transpiration and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> not only varies with stomatal resistance, but also with wind speed, air temperature, irradiance and relative humidity. Furthermore, the effect of wind speed in particular implies increase in <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation,</b> which {{is commonly}} interpreted as increased "water stress", {{but at the same}} time can reduce leaf transpiration, implying a decrease in water demand at leaf scale...|$|R

40|$|Bouchet in 1963 {{hypothesized}} that for large homogeneous land surface with minimum advection {{of heat and}} moisture, there exists a 1 : 1 complementary relationship of potential and actual evaporation coupled through land-atmosphere feedbacks. The complementary relationship has been widely used to estimate regional actual evaporation and explain the pan evaporation paradox. We examine the standardized potential <b>evaporation</b> (<b>potential</b> evaporation divided by wet environment evaporation) at 102 observatories at different elevations across China. Generally, the relationship is appropriate at the low elevations (< 1000 m). With the increase of elevation, vapor transfer power becomes much less than radiation energy budget because of lower vapor pressure deficit and stronger global solar radiation. As a result, at the high elevations (over 1000 m), the excess energy resulted by limited moisture availability {{is not enough to}} be converted into drying power of the air. This result suggests that the complementary relationship is asymmetric at the high elevations. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009...|$|E
40|$|Maximizing {{irrigation}} efficiency is of enormous importance for irrigators in the Central Great Plains to conserve water and reduce pumping costs. High temperatures, frequently strong winds and low humidity increase the <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> of water applied through sprinkler irrigation. Thus, many newer sprinkler packages {{have been developed}} to minimize water losses by evaporation and drift. These systems have the potential to reduce evaporation losses as found by Schneider and Howell (1995). Schneider and Howell found that evaporation losses could be reduced by 2 - 3 % as compared to above canopy irrigation. Many producers and irrigation companies have promoted placing sprinklers within the canopy to conserve water by reducing the exposure of the irrigation water to wind. However, runoff losses can increase as the application rate exceeds the soil infiltration capacity with a reduced wetted diameter of the spray pattern within the canopy. Schneider and Howell (2000) found that furrow dikes were necessary to prevent runoff with in-canopy irrigation. In 2003 and 2004, a study was conducted comparing sprinkler nozzle placemen...|$|E

Though this two-step <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> approach undoubtedly has practical advantages, the empirical nature of both reference evaporation methods and crop factors limits its usability in extrapolations under non-stationary climatic conditions.

40|$|Soil {{evaporation}} is {{an important}} component in the water and energy cycles on land, especially for areas that are moderately or densely covered by bare soil. Soil evaporation parameterizations that scale down <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> with the soil surface temperature (T-s) and/or the air humidity are regionally applicable because of the advantage of omitting pixel-scale near-surface soil moisture. In this paper, we provide an intercomparison study among these parameterizations. <b>Potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> indices are estimated from the Priestley-Taylor method, the Penman method, and the mass transfer method (with or without T-s). The surface dryness indices that indicate the water availability of the soil surface are based on T-s and/or the air humidity. We establish and evaluate ten such soil evaporation parameterizations through combinations of different types of <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> indices and surface dryness indices at near-instantaneous scales (30 min). The results show that incorporating the soil temperature in the surface dryness index instead of the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> index can improve soil evaporation estimations. Poorer but still reasonable estimations are achieved when only the air humidity-based surface dryness index is used. In addition, the energy balance factor is crucial in the surface dryness indices. Our study indicates that the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> indices that are based on the Penman equation are generally more useful and robust than those that are based on the Priestley-Taylor approach or the mass transfer method.

The results show that the models display different sensitivities to both rainfall and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> changes. The SIMHYD, AWBM and Zhang 01 models show mean sensitivities of 2. 4 %, 2. 5 % and 2. 1 % change in mean annual flow for every 1 % change in mean annual rainfall, respectively. All rainfall sensitivities have a lower limit of 1. 8 % and show upper limits of 4. 1 %, 3. 4 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. The results for <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> change are - 0. 5 %, - 0. 8 % and - 1. 0 % for every 1 % increase in mean annual <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation,</b> respectively, with changes rainfall being approximately 3 - 5 times more sensitive than changes in <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> for each 1 % change in climate. Despite these differences, the results show similar correlations for several catchment characteristics. The most significant relationship is between percent change in annual rainfall and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> to the catchment runoff coefficient. The sensitivity of both A and B factors decreases with an increasing runoff coefficient, as does the uncertainty in this relationship. The results suggest that a first-order relationship can be used to give a rough estimate of changes in runoff using estimates of change in rainfall and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> representing small to modest changes in climate.

In this application, the power required to maintain the wire at a given temperature is used to deduce the water content of the cloud. The model considers electrical resistive heating, axial conduction, convection to the flow, radiation to the surroundings, as well as energy loss due to the heating, melting, and evaporation of impinging liquid and or ice. All of these parameters can be varied axially along the wire. The model further introduces a parameter called the <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> which locally gauges the maximum fraction of incoming water that evaporates.

The model is used to understand the sensitivity of the hot-wire performance to various flow and boundary conditions including a detailed comparison of dry air and wet (i. e. cloud-on) conditions. The steady-state power values are compared to experimental results from a Science Engineering Associates (SEA) Multi-Element probe, a commonly used water-content measurement instrument. The model results show good agreement with experiment for both dry and cloud-on conditions with liquid water content. For ice, the experimental measurements under read the actual water content due to incomplete evaporation and splashing. Model results, which account for incomplete evaporation, are still higher than experimental results where the discrepancy is attributed to splashing mass-loss which is not accounted in the model...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Viviparous georgianus, {{a common}} {{gastropod}} species found in temperate climate marl lakes in eastern North America, records {{changes in the}} oxygen isotopic composition of surface water in Woodman Pond, a 92 -acre hardwater kettle lake in central New York State. Annual differences in shell isotopic composition are controlled by the isotopic composition of shallow lake water, which varies due {{to changes in the}} proportion of surface and groundwater infl ow versus evaporation. An eight-year record of water isotopic composition, gastropod shell isotopic composition and climate data suggest that δ 18 O of gastropod shell correlates with average summer month values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a measure that combines precipitation and <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential.</b> The most positive oxygen isotope values of gastropod shell carbonate are correlated with the most negative (hot, dry) summer values of the PDSI. Surface waters sampled at inlet and outlet sites in Woodman Pond during summers of 1999 - 2004 have δ 18 OSMOW ranging from- 10. 9 to- 8. 3 ‰. The most positive values are from outlet samples taken during relatively dry, hot summer periods. Outlet samples lie {{to the right of the}} Meteoric Water Line on a bivariate δ 18 O vs δ 2 Η plot, whereas inlet samples lie to the left, indicating that evaporation of surface lake water is an important control on water isotopic composition during summer. Oxygen stable isotopic composition of gastropod calcite varies from- 9. 8 to- 7. 3 ‰ PDB, consistent with equilibrium precipitation of calcite at lake water temperatures of 20 - 28 oC. A modest co-variance of δ 18 O and δ 13 C in the shell carbonate is observed, and is related to depletion of organic carbon from lake surface waters during the warmest mid-summer periods when evaporation is also greatest...|$|E
40|$|Survival of {{airborne}} virus influences {{the extent of}} disease transmission via air. How environmental factors affect viral survival is not fully understood. We investigated the survival of a vaccine strain of Gumboro virus which was aerosolized at three temperatures (10 °C, 20 °C, and 30 °C) and two relative humidities (RHs) (40 % and 70 %). The response of viral survival to four metrics (temperature, RH, absolute humidity [AH], and <b>evaporation</b> <b>potential</b> [EP]) was examined. The results show a biphasic viral survival at 10 °C and 20 °C, i. e., a rapid initial inactivation {{in a short period}} (2. 3 min) during and after aerosolization, followed by a slow secondary inactivation during a 20 -min period after aerosolization. The initial decays of aerosolized virus at 10 °C (1. 68 to 3. 03 ln % min- 1) and 20 °C (3. 05 to 3. 62 ln % min- 1) were significantly lower than those at 30 °C (5. 67 to 5. 96 ln % min- 1). The secondary decays at 10 °C (0. 03 to 0. 09 ln % min- 1) tended to be higher than those at 20 °C (- 0. 01 to 0. 01 ln % min- 1). The initial viral survival responded to temperature and RH and potentially to EP; the secondary viral survival responded to temperature and potentially to RH. In both phases, survival of the virus was not significantly affected by AH. These findings suggest that long-distance transmission {{of airborne}} virus is more likely to occur at 20 °C than at 10 °C or 30 °C and that current Gumboro vaccination by wet aerosolization in poultry industry is not very effective due to the fast initial decay...|$|E
50|$|Thermal classifications {{within the}} Thornthwaite scheme include microthermal, mesothermal, and megathermal regimes. A microthermal climate {{is one of}} low annual mean temperatures, {{generally}} between 0 C and 14 C which experiences short summers and has a <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> between 14 cm and 43 cm. A mesothermal climate lacks persistent heat or persistent cold, with <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> between 57 cm and 114 cm. A megathermal climate is one with persistent high temperatures and abundant rainfall, with <b>potential</b> annual <b>evaporation</b> in excess of 114 cm.|$|R

Makkink model is applied to calculate the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The runoff model driven by precipitation and <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> is developed and the influence on runoff by climate change is simulated under different scenarios. Results show that during the period 1965 - 2004 {{the temperature of the}} "Three-River Headwaters" region is increasing, the runoff of the three hydrological stations is decreasing and both of them had abrupt changes in 1994, while no significant trend changes happen to the precipitation. The runoff model suggests that the precipitation has a positive effect on the runoff depth, while the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> plays a negative role. The influence of the <b>potential</b> <b>evaporation</b> on the runoff depth of the Lancang River is found to be the significant in the three rivers; and that of the Yellow River is the least.
