We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

Porter felt that the jibe diminished Couric's journalistic credibility, deeming the Lohans easy targets.

The villain has been {{temporarily}} rendered sane by several means, including telepathic manipulation by the Martian Manhunter and being resurrected in a life-restoring Lazarus Pit (an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject). At these moments, the Joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his acts; however, during a medically induced period of partial sanity in [...] he tells his opponent: [...] "I don't <b>hate</b> <b>you</b> 'cause I'm crazy.

500|$|Survivor {{contains}} themes {{interpreted by}} the public as {{a reference to the}} group's internal conflict. The title track, [...] "Survivor", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics [...] "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family... I'm not gonna <b>hate</b> <b>you</b> in the magazine" [...] caused [...] Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: [...] "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot,... We went through our drama with the members... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better." [...] In another song called [...] "Fancy", which contains the lyrics [...] "You always tried to compete with me, girl... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, {{as a response to the}} lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized Survivor as [...] "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial." [...] Despite the album's receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of Survivor. Browne suggested that her help made Survivor a [...] "premature, but inevitable, growing pains album". In the majority of the songs on their final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't <b>hate</b> <b>you</b> anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They <b>hate</b> <b>you</b> too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E
