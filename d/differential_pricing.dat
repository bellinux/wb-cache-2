5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy.

This paper aims to tell the story of the evolution of both money-metric and non-money-metric poverty and inequality in post-apartheid South Africa, and to assess the effect of prices on this story.

Price fairness derives from equity theory and it is focused on assuring in a transaction a reasonable report between the customer 2 ̆ 019 s sacrifice and the value offered by the seller. In three marketing experiments we have evaluated customers 2 ̆ 019 fairness perceptions of <b>differential</b> <b>prices,</b> this tactic being frequently used by sellers. One important finding was that the motive for setting <b>differential</b> <b>prices</b> is important in fairness evaluation. Price differences based on social motives are perceived fairer than those motivated by company 2 ̆ 019 s interest. The <b>differential</b> <b>prices</b> on customer category are perceived fairer than zone prices. In all three marketing experiments it was demonstrated that price fairness has a significant influence on value perception and on buying intentions.

Does high price transparency imply that consumers in different countries pay the same price for similar goods? We compare prices for new, tradable goods sold via the internet auction site eBay.

This indicates that suffcient scope for price discrimination exists between countries, even in very transparent markets such as online auctions. Moreover, our results show that national borders are a key force driving international <b>price</b> <b>differentials.</b> Contrary to other studies, we do not find that having a currency of one's own drives up cross-border <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> significantly.

40|$|Food {{prices and}} food {{affordability}} are important determinants of food choices, obesity and non-communicable diseases. As governments {{around the world}} consider policies to promote the consumption of healthier foods, data on the relative price and affordability of foods, with a particular focus on the difference between ‘less healthy’ and ‘healthy’ foods and diets, are urgently needed. This paper briefly reviews past and current approaches to monitoring food prices, and identifies key issues affecting the development of practical tools and methods for food price data collection, analysis and reporting. A step-wise monitoring framework, including measurement indicators, is proposed. ‘Minimal’ data collection will assess the <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ foods; ‘expanded’ monitoring will assess the <b>differential</b> <b>price</b> of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ diets; and the ‘optimal’ approach will also monitor food affordability, by taking into account household income. The monitoring of the price and affordability of ‘healthy’ and ‘less healthy’ foods and diets globally will provide robust data and benchmarks to inform economic and fiscal policy responses. Given the range of methodological, cultural and logistical challenges in this area, {{it is imperative that}} all aspects of the proposed monitoring framework are tested rigorously before implementation.
