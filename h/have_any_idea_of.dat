500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of,</b> who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E
500|$|Chilembwe's aims {{have also}} come under scrutiny. According to Robert I. Rotberg, Chilembwe's speech of 23 January {{appeared}} {{to stress the}} importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation. The same speech depicted the uprising {{as a manifestation of}} desperation but because of his desire to [...] "strike a blow and die", he did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what he would replace colonialism with if the revolt succeeded. Rotberg concludes that Chilembwe planned to seize power in the Shire Highlands or perhaps in all of Nyasaland. John McCracken attacks the idea that the revolt could be considered nationalist, arguing that Chilembwe's ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of the colonial system, particularly thangata. According to McCracken, the uprising failed because Chilembwe was over-reliant on a small Europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support. Rotberg's examination the Chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that Chilembwe's personal situation, his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot the rebellion.|$|E

[...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars." [...] There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, [...] " [...] people have a way of disappearing on the road." ...|$|E

500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the onset}} of development, the team did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what songs would {{be present in the}} final game. Kay noted that [...] "We wanted 30 or 40songs for the game and put a hundred on our wish list." [...] The game was to focus mostly on hard rock songs, but the team was limited by what could be licensed. The team also felt [...] "morally obligated" [...] to include older, classic rock songs like The Ramones [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated" [...] to the younger target {{audience}} of the game. [...] Harmonix had to modify the track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues, requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list. [...] WaveGroup Sound were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game. Marcus Henderson of the band Drist provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers. WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs. [...] In the case of Black Sabbaths [...] "Iron Man", the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having Ozzy Osbourne sing from behind a metal fan. [...] The team sought out the same model of fan through Craigslist to generate the same effect in the game's cover. Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew. Additionally, a [...] "Be a Guitar Hero" [...] contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song {{to be included in the}} game. [...] The winning song was [...] "Cheat on the Church" [...] by Graveyard BBQ. [...] Black Label Societys song, [...] "Fire it Up", was included two weeks before the game was completed at the request of Zakk Wylde. [...] The final song list was set very near to the shipping date.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where is it really going?" [...] That is {{precisely the kind of}} question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel.
