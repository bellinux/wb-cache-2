"I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> I {{have not}} said, but I {{think it will}} help us {{understand}} why we arrived at this information: there was much talk about the cybernetic fraud, everyone thought that the fraud had {{been done in the}} cibernético , in the machines, the truth is that it took us time [...] in the first days there was that idea that it was informático [...] We found that the fraud is not there, we found that it is in the papers, that it is a fraude a la antigüita [...] The truth is that we were thinking that it was a modern fraud, cybernetic, but no. he information we have is that they took the polling places in the old style and there were these counterfeits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you breathe}} a {{syllable}} to a soul--I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> In my opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were considerable better yesterday {{than they are}} to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Mrs. Bold, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{which you}} may perhaps think indelicate, but yet I know that I am right in doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is the truth. What I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I'd as soon {{say in the}} {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R
60|$|Admiral Harrington here is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all that}} I have left untold.

6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by talking about a story? I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a {{statement}}. A statement is a matter of fact, therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction.

60|$|And now, at the last, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of {{the ways}} and doings of one of the queer little people, whom I shall call Whiskey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not. Men {{of that sort}} are always jealous of their sons. But he has. Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> and {{ask you to do}} something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my child,' said she, seeking her out one day, 'I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> It is {{only this}} moment broached; and {{naturally}} I hurry {{to you the}} moment it IS broached.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> {{have trained}} service {{and how to}} make your hotels distinctive. They're good hotels, as hotels go, and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences, as you promise, but your hotels are not distinctive. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> make them so." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this is all}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about how}} Reddy Fox went fishing.|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I did {{it because}} I {{was in love with}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here! I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{that will}} rather {{surprise}} you, and that perhaps {{will make you}} think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isobel," [...] I said, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{which will}} {{surprise}} you very much. It is necessary that I tell you at once. If you answer {{me at all}} do not speak above a whisper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You all {{see what}} a black coat Buster has," [...] said Old Mother Nature. [...] "Now I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> which may {{surprise}} you. Just as there are Red Foxes that are black, so there are Black Bears that are brown." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this is all}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about the}} fuss in the big pine.|$|R
5000|$|We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> earlier. (past {{form of the}} going-to future, {{formed with}} the past copula were) ...|$|R
60|$|The moral {{in this is}} {{perfectly}} clear, and I think there's one in they next memory I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you don't. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> I've {{never told}} a living soul, not even Ray." [...] The dam of {{repressed}} imagination which Vida had builded for years, which now, with Raymie {{off at the}} wars, she was building again, gave way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Pierston,' {{he said as}} {{they sat}} down, 'since it is well you should know all the truth before we go any further, {{that there may be}} no awkward discoveries afterwards, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about myself--if you are not too distressed to hear it?' ...|$|E

[...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> now, dear, which you may not believe, but it is for your good, and it is {{necessary}} for me to have some excuse for the request I am going to make. Granet is under suspicion at the War Office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nope," [...] he said lightly, [...] "this {{man from}} the bad, wicked world ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing of the kind. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{of the good things}} in that world. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how he loved hosses when he was a shaver, and about the first hoss he straddled, and the first hoss he owned. Hosses ain't like men. They're better.

Hosses! They're my long suit. I sure dote on hosses. Yep. I used to be a cowboy once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I an't a <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> Get away! I shouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if you was by yourself; {{much less}} with your old {{sweetheart}} here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{surprised}} our secret," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "but anyhow, Stephen was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to-day. We {{were married}} {{the day before}} yesterday." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Miss Duge," [...] he said, [...] "we {{have known}} {{one another for}} some time, {{although}} chance has never been very kind {{to me in the}} way of bringing us together.

6000|$|... "When {{you opened}} the door of the house in Russell Square for me and calmly took back your notes which I had been to fetch. That was one time, at any rate. But I never had the {{slightest}} feeling of affection for you, or the slightest intention of marrying you, however long you waited. Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else, if I may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that you}} might be more happy as Mrs. Sowerby of Chaldicotes than you can be as Miss Dunstable--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The story I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> boys, {{is an old}} fable {{about making}} enemies. It is called ‘The Bear and the Tomtit.’ ” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe you," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{am going}} now to extend it. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> which will {{probably}} surprise you very much.

Exact copies of them are in Paris to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> those fellows in {{the smoking}} room to-night {{did their best}} to screw out of me. If you say {{anything}} about it, all's up between me and Wing. The fact that he picked me out to engineer the thing, and that he's going to let me in if I push it through, is a pretty good sign that he thinks something of my business ability, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honey, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{about myself}} that nobody dreams of. Betty, when I was your age, I {{ran away from}} a man because I loved him. It {{was just a little}} village tragedy, my dear.

6000|$|... "The entertainment," [...] he said, [...] "will incur {{no greater}} {{hardship}} upon you {{than a little}} patience. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story." ...|$|R
