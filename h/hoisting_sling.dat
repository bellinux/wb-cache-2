The structural member can be rotated in any manner, angle, or direction without being released by the clamp...|$|R
60|$|When Marston woke in {{the morning}} his {{headache}} and languidness had gone. It {{looked as if the}} powder the mulatto had left had cured him, and although he did not find the laudanum and packet of drugs, he resolved he would not bother about their loss. In a day or two, small lots of rather valuable cargo began to arrive and one afternoon Marston and Wyndham lounged under the awning and watched the Krooboys transfer goods from a big canoe to the yacht. Four or five negroes from up river put the fiber packages in the <b>hoisting</b> <b>slings.</b>|$|R

Each engine provides 670 shp, increasing the service ceiling to around 7,000 m, providing improved high altitude and high temperature operation. Helicopter has new avionics with multifunctional displays, automatic control system, navigation system, radar. It can be equipped with <b>hoist</b> system, helicopter <b>sling,</b> searchlight, additional external fuel tank. For search and rescue missions helicopter can be equipped with medical module.|$|R
5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were <b>hoisted</b> up in <b>slings,</b> {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|R

Various portions of the rotorcraft are made from composite materials, such as the rotor blades that made of carbon fiber, other materials are used in portions of the fuselage. The fuselage features anti-corrosion protection, and is structurally reinforced for an optional <b>hoist</b> or cargo <b>sling</b> to be installed, various other mooring and gripping points are also fitted on the rotocraft's exterior surface. Various types and models of radar can be installed in the Dauphin's nose.|$|R
5000|$|Splashdown {{occurred}} with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. Freedom 7 tilted over on its right side about 60 degrees from an upright position, {{but did not}} show any signs of leaking; it gently righted itself after a minute, and Shepard was able {{to report to the}} circling aircraft that he had landed safely and was ready to be recovered. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and after a brief problem with the spacecraft antenna, the capsule was lifted partly out of the water in order to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a <b>sling</b> <b>hoist,</b> and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and his spacecraft to a waiting aircraft carrier, [...] The whole recovery process had taken only eleven minutes, from splashdown to arriving aboard.|$|R
500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a <b>sling</b> <b>hoist,</b> and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|R
