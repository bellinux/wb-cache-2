5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> that does.|$|E
25|$|While some {{manufacturers}} {{are competing for}} the smallest size with the biggest memory, {{some manufacturers}} differentiate their products by using elaborate housings, which are often bulky and make the drive difficult to connect to the USB port. Because the USB port connectors on a computer housing are often closely spaced, plugging a flash drive into a USB port may block an adjacent port. Such devices may carry the USB logo only if sold with a separate <b>extension</b> <b>cable.</b> Such cables are USB-compatible but {{do not conform to}} the USB standard.|$|E
25|$|Following its introduction, the MacBook Air {{was greeted}} with a mixed reception. The {{portability}} of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, but the compromise in features was criticized. The full-sized keyboard, weight, thinness, and Multi-Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews, while the limited configuration options and ports, slow speed (in non-SSD models), non-user-replaceable battery, small hard drive, and price were criticized. The flip-down hatch {{on the side of}} the original MacBook Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and USB devices, requiring users to purchase an <b>extension</b> <b>cable.</b> Apple removed the flip-down hatch on the late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports, as is the case with most other laptops.|$|E
50|$|Controller <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} by many companies.|$|R
25|$|<b>Extension</b> <b>cables</b> {{are used}} to link the primary nodes to the {{secondary}} infrastructure, providing power and communications.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of stage pin connectors, many smaller installations use Edison connectors due to their availability and the ease of connecting equipment to outlets already available in a building. This reduces refit costs, particularly when small portable dimming packs (often 4×1.2 kW channel models) are used. Such installations may also use inexpensive store-bought <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> though {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the ratings of such <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> are not exceeded.|$|R
5000|$|The Headphone <b>Extension</b> <b>cable</b> is a ⅛" [...] (3.5mm) male {{to female}} <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> with volume control. This cable allows players to comfortably stand {{back from their}} console when playing the game with {{headphones}} on.|$|E
5000|$|Cord Length: 6 feet (11 {{feet with}} {{included}} 5-foot <b>extension</b> <b>cable)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Even if no modular {{connector}} {{is included}} in an <b>extension</b> <b>cable,</b> most 600 series extension cables are four conductor. Pair one is always connected, and either pair two or three.|$|E
50|$|Thermocouple {{wires and}} <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> are {{identified}} by color code {{for the type}} of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.|$|R
50|$|During the VISIONS ’13 {{expedition}} to continue construction of RSN, over 22,000 meters of <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> were {{installed on the}} ocean floor. The cables all successfully went online.|$|R
50|$|Plugs {{are used}} to {{terminate}} loose cables and cords, while jacks are used for fixed locations on surfaces such as walls and panels, and on equipment. Other than telephone <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> cables with a modular plug on one end and a jack on the other are rare. Instead, cables are connected using a male-to-male adapter, which consists of two female jacks wired back-to-back.|$|R
50|$|Smaller stage boxes (typically with 2 or 4 connectors) {{with short}} length {{multicore}} cables are called drop boxes. These are typically {{used to carry}} microphone signals {{from one side of}} the stage to the other, or as an <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> for a few channels on a larger stage box.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the initial}} cost of {{constructing}} a 12/3 stage pin <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> {{is higher than}} simply purchasing an equivalent Edison <b>extension</b> <b>cable,</b> the maintenance costs of the former are ultimately lower for several reasons. To begin with, less maintenance will be required {{as a result of}} the more rugged construction. When maintenance is required, many cable faults may be repaired by disassembling the connector, replacing broken components with spares acquired by cannibalizing other broken connectors, trimming away defective sections of cable, and reapplying the connector to the cable. This sort of repair is not usually possible with Edison connectors, particularly the factory-molded type. If a connector is beyond repair, a new stage pin connector is often less expensive than a replacement Edison connector when purchased from local vendors.|$|E
5000|$|While {{he lived}} there, his abode {{was a tiny}} studio cabin which was closer to a shack than a house. He wired it for {{electricity}} by drawing a long <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> from a nearby house. He called it his [...] "Getsemane" [...] after the biblical site, or sometimes his [...] "castle in the clouds".|$|E
50|$|Plugs and <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> (BS 1363) {{sold in the}} UK and Hong Kong {{come with}} {{instructions}} on how to wire them safely. They are marked on the extension unit, or in form of a separate sheet.|$|R
5000|$|A round socket {{used at the}} end of <b>extension</b> <b>cables.</b> This is {{also the}} same size and shape as the earlier variant of the regular plug, but there are no pins and the socket holes are on the side where the pins would {{otherwise}} be.|$|R
50|$|Some local {{manufacturers}} {{print the}} Union Flag on the plugs and <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> but {{these products are}} not manufactured or sold in the United Kingdom. This practice has not ceased even though Hong Kong was transferred back to the People's Republic of China in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Later Flip Video models came in {{a variety}} of colors, and could be custom ordered with designs {{digitally}} painted on. Accessories for the Flip Video camera included an underwater case, a mini-tripod, a bicycle helmet attachment, and a wool case (Mino camcorders) or soft pouch (Flip UltraHD), rechargeable battery replacements for the UltraHD series, and an <b>extension</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Funding for a wave farm {{known as}} Wave hub off {{the north coast}} of Cornwall, England was {{approved}} in June 2007. The Wave hub operates as an <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> allowing developers to install and operate wave energy generating devices while keeping down connection costs. Four device operators have {{expressed an interest in}} using the site which will initially allow up to 20MW of wave energy capacity.|$|E
50|$|On the NES Four Score, {{there is}} an option to switch between two-player and four-player modes, and there are turbo A and B buttons that give any of the {{connected}} controllers a rapid fire boost. The NES Four Score {{can also be used}} as a controller <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> because the wire which leads from the accessory to the NES is several feet in length.|$|E
2500|$|Port replicators (also called passthroughs) are {{functionally}} and logically {{identical to}} {{a bundle of}} <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> except that they are plugged in and unplugged together through the docking port. Some also include electrical adaptors to change from one pinout to another (e.g., Micro-DVI to normal DVI connector.) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{is common}} in <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> {{many of which have}} {{built-in}} adaptors to 6P4C (and more rarely to 6P6C). There are several conflicting schemes, some using pair two in addition to one, others one and three. As most applications use only pair one, most users are unaware of the potential problem.|$|R
50|$|When a {{computer}} with a self-encrypting drive is put into sleep mode, the drive is powered down, but the encryption password is retained in memory so that the drive can be quickly resumed without requesting the password. An attacker {{can take advantage of}} this to gain easier physical access to the drive, for instance, by inserting <b>extension</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector {{includes}} a USB <b>extension</b> <b>cable,</b> a manual, and a software CD. It {{is recommended that}} {{the latest version of}} the Wi-Fi USB Connector software should be downloaded and installed rather than using the version on the CD, as important updates {{have been made in the}} newer versions. Devices shipped with software driver versions below 1.05 are incompatible with Windows Vista until updated.|$|E
50|$|Very short cables {{that connect}} {{relatively}} large jacks to smaller plugs allowing cables {{to be easily}} installed and removed from equipment with limited space available for connectors. The Chromecast device mentioned above, for example, comes with a short HDMI <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> to allow its use in cramped quarters. Some devices come with a permanently attached length of cable that negates {{the need for a}} short adapter cable.|$|E
50|$|While some {{manufacturers}} {{are competing for}} the smallest size with the biggest memory, {{some manufacturers}} differentiate their products by using elaborate housings, which are often bulky and make the drive difficult to connect to the USB port. Because the USB port connectors on a computer housing are often closely spaced, plugging a flash drive into a USB port may block an adjacent port.

50|$|Before the {{legislation}} of the Electrical Products Regulation (a few {{years prior to}} the handover in 1997), British standard <b>extension</b> <b>cables,</b> plugs and adaptors were seldom found in the market. Electrical appliances were fitted with 2-pin plugs and quasi-UK three pin plugs (which meant they were compatible with BS 1363 or BS 546 sockets, but the plug itself did not comply with the British Standard).|$|R
50|$|The {{converted}} 375Vdc voltage {{from the}} primary nodes is then directed at low-and medium-power nodes and junction boxes. The nodes and junction boxes (similar to power strips) offer direct power and communications to the instruments at the experimental sites. In concert, these parts make up the RSN secondary infrastructure. <b>Extension</b> <b>cables</b> are used to link the primary nodes to the secondary infrastructure, providing power and communications.|$|R
50|$|Wireless {{cameras are}} proving very popular among modern {{security}} consumers {{due to their}} low installation costs (there {{is no need to}} run expensive video <b>extension</b> <b>cables)</b> and flexible mounting options; wireless cameras can be mounted/installed in locations previously unavailable to standard wired cameras. In addition to the ease of use and convenience of access, wireless security camera allows users to leverage broadband wireless internet to provide seamless video streaming over-internet.|$|R

5000|$|In general, {{neuromodulation}} systems deliver electrical {{currents and}} typically consist {{of the following}} components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical [...] "paddle" [...] or [...] "grid" [...] electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG). Depending on {{the distance from the}} electrode access point an <b>extension</b> <b>cable</b> may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2-5 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.|$|E

500|$|Released in January 1996, USB1.0 {{specified}} a {{data rate}} of 1.5Mbit/s (Low Bandwidth or Low Speed). It {{did not allow}} for <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> or pass-through monitors, due to timing and power limitations. Few USB devices {{made it to the}} market until USB1.1 was released in August 1998, which introduced the speed of 12Mbit/s (full speed). USB1.1 was the earliest revision that was widely adopted and led to what Microsoft designated the [...] "Legacy-free PC".|$|R
50|$|Some {{stage pin}} <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> may be {{constructed}} from cable with {{six or more}} conductors. This cable can be fitted with multiple stage-pin connectors at either end enabling the single cable to carry multiple independent output channels of dimmed power. Each channel or circuit should have its own line, ground, and neutral conductor independent of the other circuits, though {{in some cases the}} ground or neutral lines may be shared among circuits.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2004, BT Wholesale {{removed the}} line-length/loss limits for 500 kbit/s ADSL, instead {{employing}} a tactic of [...] "suck it and see" [...] — enabling the line, then seeing if ADSL would work on it. This sometimes includes {{the installation of}} a filtered faceplate on the customer's master socket, so as to eliminate poor quality telephone <b>extension</b> <b>cables</b> inside the customer's premises {{which can be a}} source of high frequency noise.|$|R
