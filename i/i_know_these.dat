500|$|The Ramones' debut LP {{was greeted}} by rock critics with glowing reviews. The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "I love this record—love it—even though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> boys flirt with images of {{brutality}} (Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio". In Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson described it as [...] "constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days." [...] Characterizing the band as [...] "authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood", he declared, [...] "It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives." [...] Newsdays Wayne Robbins simply anointed the Ramones as [...] "the best young rock 'n' roll band in the known universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1999, Rowling said in {{interview}} {{that she was}} a great fan of Grimble by Clement Freud, saying: [...] "Grimble is one of funniest books I've ever read, and Grimble himself, who is a small boy, is a fabulous character. I'd love to see a Grimble film. As far as <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> last two fine pieces of literature are out of print, so if any publishers ever read this, could you please dust them off and put them back in print so other people can read them?" ...|$|E
2500|$|When Churchill's many fanciful {{strategic}} ideas {{collided with}} sound military strategy {{it was only}} Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{who was able to}} stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: [...] "When I thump the table and push my face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> Brookes – stiff-necked Ulstermen and there's no one worse to deal with than that!" [...] It has been claimed that part of Churchill's greatness was that he appointed Brooke as CIGS and kept him for the whole war.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he turned}} to Maqueda and added, [...] "Child of Kings, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> people of yours to be cowardly and treacherous, but is it thus that you suffer them to deal with envoys under a flag of peace?" ...|$|R
60|$|Three American correspondents were there--there {{may have}} been more, but three <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>These</b> were Messrs. Julian Ralph, James Barnes, and Unger. The first two were much {{impressed}} by the humanity and discipline of the British troops, though Mr. Ralph was, I believe, like Captain Slocum, {{of the opinion that}} it was occasionally pushed too far. Mr. Unger's published impressions of the war confirm the same idea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{may as well}} {{begin at}} the beginning," [...] said Mrs. Munger, [...] "and I'll try to be short, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> are {{business}} hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Gowan--I {{mean the}} dowager, my polite friend's mother--is {{intimate}} with Mrs Merdle, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> two {{to be on}} their visiting list.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> people!" [...] cried Dave, in astonishment. [...] "They are the moving-picture {{actors who}} were on board that burning steam yacht!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> are life's tragedies. I'm {{very sorry}} for you. But it can't be helped. I've made my pile, so why continue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{drives me}} wild, Mr Richard, sir,' said Brass, 'she exasperates me beyond all bearing. I am heated and excited, sir, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am. <b>These</b> are not {{business}} manners, sir, nor business looks, but she carries {{me out of}} myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> blessed; <b>these</b> masterful people bore me, too. But aren't we modern {{enough so}} we can discuss frankly the {{question}} of whether I'd better propose to you, some day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly, just as I {{should say}} that Mrs Umbleby had a red-haired little dog. I wish <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>these</b> Scatcherds, uncle. <b>I</b> do so admire people that can push {{themselves}} in the world. I wish <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> Sir Roger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Need I not?" [...] he sneered. [...] "Ma foi! but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> ruffians. There is not {{an ounce}} of honour in the whole National Convention." ...|$|E
6000|$|Think not {{but that}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things; [...] Or think I know them not, [...] Not {{therefore}} am I short [...] Of knowing what I ought, &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carlos, let us {{sit down}} here {{a minute or}} two till we can think what we had better do. We can sit here, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> benches must be for any body." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a {{travelled}} man," [...] La-lah answered. [...] "I have journeyed on {{the deep}} seas and seen signs and wonders, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> things be so. I am La-lah--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>these</b> outlaws are. Yes, you're different." [...] She {{kept the}} {{strained}} gaze upon him, but hope was kindling, {{and the hard}} lines of her youthful face were softening.|$|R
5000|$|The Los Angeles-born Leslie McCarthy {{stated that}} {{her love for}} film scenery came as a child when she was allowed to {{accompany}} her mother to Paramount Pictures. She stated, [...] "The sets were magnificent—everything in place and so character driven." [...] She added, [...] "I remember how fascinating it was to see these rich rooms held up by unfinished wood and 2×4s! I was very young, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> people were creating magic and I {{wanted to be a}} part of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{that old}} priest rose {{who had been}} my guide in the Sanctuary of the Mother and made answer: [...] "There is none; O Amenemhat; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> things of my own knowledge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tears in her eyes!" [...] Kendricks muttered. [...] "Sobbing {{to herself}} as she went down the steps! Crocodile's tears, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> d--d women, Julien! Out with it. What did she come for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe so. But I'm {{beginning}} to see the Don's game. And, Miss Hammond, I--It's awful for me to think what you'd suffer if Don Carlos got you over the line. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> low-caste Mexicans. I've been among the peons--the slaves." ...|$|E
50|$|Mr. Greenblatt. I am {{unwilling to}} testify until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> kinds of tactics {{will no longer}} be employed, until I have some kind of {{assurance}} as to the well-being of Mr. Hoffman.|$|R
6000|$|... "My Spirit {{comes to}} me again and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> our {{brothers}} shall not pass unavenged. Chief of the Axe, great glory awaits the Axe, for it shall feed full. I have spoken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poggin, Blossom Kane, Panhandle Smith, Boldt, Jim Fletcher, {{and another}} man <b>I</b> don't <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> are the picked men of Cheseldine's gang. I'll bet they'll be the fastest, hardest bunch you rangers ever faced." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is the 20th of September, 1850. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> figures I {{have just}} written, {{as if they}} were a long {{familiar}} inscription. I have seen them on this pace in my desk unnumbered times, when the scene of my dying struggle has opened upon me [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and take}} half {{the ship and}} cargo for salvage! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> piccaroons, and {{you ought to know}} 'em too, Miles, for it's only two or three years since you were a {{prisoner}} of war among 'em. That was a delightful feelin', I rather conclude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] Sam answered; [...] "but him {{not safe}} to wait. You believe me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> tam niggers. They take two days get drunk, then get devils, four--raving mad. They drunk now. Kill any one to-morrow--perhaps you. Kill you certain to-morrow night. You listen now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not only,' said Helen, 'that we {{are sure}} that it is not right to go {{anywhere}} without leave from Papa or Mamma, but that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>these</b> Mechanics' Institutes are part of a system of--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is madness, boy," [...] Captain Drake said. [...] "There are few men, indeed, {{so far as}} <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> in <b>these</b> climes--I talk not of the heathens of the Western Islands--who could swim {{through a}} {{breaking}} sea, like yonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should anybody {{have told}} me? Have I not an instinct? Can I not divine by analogy? Moore {{never talked to}} me either about Cowper, or Rousseau, or love. The voice we hear in {{solitude}} told me all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> on <b>these</b> subjects." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Never {{you mind}} that,' he answers; 'you {{give him a}} pint of old ale. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> ponies; he's a good 'un, but he ain't set. A pint of old ale, and he'll take you up that hill like a cable tramway, and not hurt himself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are {{the very}} men I have myself led,' said Monmouth at last, in a low voice, as though uttering his {{thoughts}} aloud. 'Over yonder at the right I see Dumbarton's foot. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> men well. They will fight. Had we them with us all would be well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do? Why, leave Choisy at once. Come; be stirring. In God's name, girl, bethink {{you that}} we have not a moment to lose. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> Republicans, and how far they are to be trusted. This fellow would betray me to save his skin with as little compunction as--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was lucky}} you fell in with me, Teddy, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how <b>these</b> things are worked, an' {{can give you}} a good many {{pointers}} before the fair is over. Why, you'll have a first-class outfit for about half what it's worth." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a hundred}} years the stories of Betty and Isaac Zane have been familiar, oft-repeated tales in my family--tales told with that pardonable ancestral pride which seems {{inherent}} in every one. My grandmother loved to cluster the children round her {{and tell them that}} {{when she was a little}} girl she had knelt at the feet of Betty Zane, and listened to the old lady as she told of her brother's capture by the Indian Princess, of the burning of the Fort, and of her own race for life. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> stories by heart when a child.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} easy of explanation. <b>I</b> had <b>known,</b> as every {{prisoner}} in San Quentin knew, {{that the two}} men in solitary were Ed Morrell and Jake Oppenheimer. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>these</b> were the two men who tapped knuckle- talk to each other and were punished for so doing.|$|R
