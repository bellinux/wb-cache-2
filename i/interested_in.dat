When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{attitudes and}} {{interests}} of fifth form students who had had {{at least two years}} of experimental Nuffield 0 -Level courses in biology, physics, and chemistry were compared with those of equivalent students studying traditional courses.

5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT.

In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT.

40|$|While high {{motivation}} {{to expand the}} self may lead to <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-ethnic interactions, social self-efficacy may moderate this effect, such that those high in social self-efficacy will show a stronger effect of self-expansion motivation on <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions. Study 1 failed to show the predicted interaction, but did show that social self-efficacy {{played a significant role}} <b>in</b> predicting <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions. Study 2 extended Study 1, manipulating participants’ expectations about the success of the interaction. The primary interaction emerged: for those with high social self-efficacy, higher self-expansion motivation led to more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions. For those low <b>in</b> social self-efficacy, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions was uninfluenced by self-expansion motivation. The manipulation of expectations produced only an interaction with social self-efficacy, where higher self-efficacy lead to greater <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions when expectations were positive, but did not influence <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions when expectations were ambiguous...|$|R
