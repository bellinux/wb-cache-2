In order to complete their review, the Staff has requested additional information to our application. The proposed Request for Additional Information (RAI) had been provided to us electronically on April 30, 2001 to facilitate discussions. As {{a result of this}} conference call, modifications were made to this draft RAI and it was retransmitted to us electronically on May 9, 2001. The Attachment to this letter contains the modified RAI and our Responses. The following new commitment is being made in this letter: The NMC will either: 1) perform the generator load reject and full main steamline isolation valve closure transients tests required by the Extended Power Uprate (EPU) topical report ELTR- 1, at their respective required power levels; or, 2) NMC will submit a request to deviate from ELTR- 1, with supporting additional justification for not performing these large transient tests at uprated power conditions, and we will not operate the DAEC at power levels above that at which the individual tests are required by ELTR- 1 prior to NRC approval of that <b>deviation</b> <b>request.</b> Please contact this office should you require additional information regarding this matter...|$|E

30|$|The {{balancing}} functionality of the VPP {{is performed}} by the so-called Imbalance Agent. In {{the case of this}} project, this software agent used the flexibility of the heat pumps to reduce the imbalance of the wind turbine farm. The real-time imbalance of the wind farm was used as an input for this agent. During this part of the test, 150 heat pumps were connected to the VPP. As each heat pump has a nominal power of 1 kW, and a low duty cycle (i.e. the heat pumps operate with relatively long off times), the power <b>deviations</b> <b>requested</b> from the VPP were chosen in the range of ± 10 kW. From the energy supplier in the project, the imbalance signal of a nearby wind turbine was fed into the system, scaled to this response range. The imbalance signal was the difference between the day-ahead forecasted wind generation and the actual generation.|$|R

40|$|A primary {{feature of}} the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is {{trajectory}} based operations (TBO). Under TBO, aircraft flight plans are known to computer systems {{on the ground that}} aid in scheduling and separation. The Future Air Navigation System (FANS) was developed to support TBO, but relatively few aircraft in the US are FANSequipped. Thus, any near-term implementation must provide TBO procedures for non-FANS aircraft. Previous research has explored controller clearances, but any implementation must also provide procedures for aircraft requests. The work presented here aims to surface issues surrounding TBO communication procedures for non-FANS aircraft and for aircraft <b>requesting</b> <b>deviations</b> around weather. Three types of communication were explored: Voice, FANS, and ACARS,(Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System). ACARS and FANS are datacom systems that differ in that FANS allows uplinked flight plans to be loaded into the Flight Management System (FMS), while ACARS delivers flight plans as text that must be entered manually via the Control Display Unit (CDU). Sixteen pilots (eight two-person flight decks) and four controllers participated in 32 20 -minute scenarios that required the flight decks to navigate through convective weather as they approached their top of descents (TODs). Findings: The rate of non-conformance was higher than anticipated, with aircraft off path more than 20 % of the time. Controllers did not differentiate between the ACARS and FANS datacom, and were mixed in their preference for Voice vs. datacom (ACARS and FANS). Pilots uniformly preferred Voice to datacom, particularly ACARS. Much of their dislike appears to result from the slow response times in the datacom conditions. As a result, participants frequently resorted to voice communication. These results imply that, before implementing TBO in environments where pilots make weather <b>deviation</b> <b>requests,</b> {{further research is needed to}} develop communication procedures that integrate voice and datacom...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} how monitoring and fault management in a ship control task are affected by complexity and a priori probability of disturbances. Partici-pants were required to supervise four independent shipping subsystems and to adjust the subsystems whenever deviations occurred. However, in order to apply the correct action, they first had to diagnose {{the cause of the}} <b>deviation</b> by <b>requesting</b> further sub-system information. Complexity and a priori probability were manipulated by varying the number of disturbances occurring simultaneously and the disturbance rates over subsystems. In general, the results indicate that the participants ignored the monitoring function when they were diagnosing a disturbance. Results also show evidence for 'cognitive lockup': Despite the possibility of stabilizing additional system faults and, consequently, increase their time for diagnosis, participants tended not to interrupt an ongoing fault-finding process. Still, large individual differences were found in both the selected strategy and reasoning abilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} of disk scheduling algorithms, V(R), having endpoints V(0) = SSTF and V(1) = SCAN, is defined. V(R) maintains a current SCAN direction (in or out) and services next the request {{with the smallest}} effective distance. The effective distance of a request that lies in the current direction is its physical distance (in cylinders) from the read/write head. The effective distance of a request {{in the opposite direction}} is its physical distance plus R X (total number of cylinders on the disk). By use of simulation methods, it is shown that this definitional continuum also provides a continuum in performance, both with respect to the mean and with respect to the standard <b>deviation</b> of <b>request</b> waiting time. For objective functions that are linear combinations of the two measures, pw + kuw, intermediate points of the continuum are seen to provide performance uniformly superior to both SSTF and SCAN.

30|$|Constrained by the {{crawling}} algorithms for automatic web content download, it {{is difficult}} for crawlers to perfectly mimic human beings’ visiting patterns. Therefore, path related features can effectively differentiate crawlers and normal users. Stevanovic et al. (2013) uses standard <b>deviation</b> of <b>requested</b> page depth as one feature to describe the visiting path. However, it cannot accurately reflect the difference between crawlers and normal users since the page depth is simply extracted from parsing the URL. Tan and Kumor (2004) learn session depth and width from the referrer field of HTTP request headers to more accurately describe the path information. However, it is easy for intelligent crawlers to fake the referrer field of HTTP headers. Similarly, PathMarker also largely rely on path-related features to identify crawlers. Differently, PathMarker relies on the URL marker appended to each URL to learn the referring relationship between two requests. The URL marker and path of a URL are encrypted so the crawler cannot fake visiting path through forging URL markers.|$|R
40|$|Background Laparoscopic forceps have a {{large amount}} of {{friction}} in the mechanism, leading to a limited mechanical efficiency, which impairs the pinch force feedback. The advantage of a small amount of friction is that it is easier to maintain a constant pinch force on the tissue. Therefore, to obtain the optimal mechanical efficiency of the forceps, the influence of mechanical efficiency on the performance of several static and dynamic operative tasks, such as grasping tissue and estimating pressure, is quantified. Methods: A grasper with adjustable mechanical efficiency and a load cell to measure the pinch force on the tissue was developed. Using this grasper, subjects performed several tasks on pig bowel tissue and simulation tissue: grasping tissue, reproducing a requested constant or variable pinch forces, and estimating the pressure in a tube. Results: With increasing mechanical efficiency, a variable pinch force could be reproduced more accurately (<b>deviation</b> from the <b>requested</b> pinch force decreased from 34. 4 to 24. 9 %, p = 0. 016). The performance on the grasping tissue, reproducing a constant pinch force, and estimating pressure tasks did not improve with increased mechanical efficiency. Conclusions: The optimal mechanical efficiency of laparoscopic forceps is dependent on the task that is performed. For tasks requiring little movement of the forceps, such as grasping and holding tissue, a low mechanical efficiency is sufficient, whereas for tasks requiring repeated movement of the forceps to feel tissue, a high mechanical efficiency is require...|$|R
40|$|The 'Perruche' decree (confirmed by the Paris Court of Cassation in November 2001) {{recognizes the}} right of those born with a {{handicap}} to claim for compensation. However, there is a fear that this decree might lead to <b>deviations</b> in the <b>requests</b> submitted for systematic compensation, simply because of a handicap or prejudice, {{even in the absence}} of a medical error. The interest of the 'Perruche' decree is that it once again raises the question of the management of handicapped people in our society and the lack of sufficient help from the State. The decree also emphasizes the strong subjacent risk that a handicap could be considered as a failure or a medical error. The excessive ideology of a 'perfect' child may therefore provoke the reject of the idea that a human being may be born with a deficiency or "imperfection". It also reminds us that medical practice remains exposed to errors and incertitude and that a zero risk does not exist, contrary to certain fantastical beliefs fostered by the principle of precaution. The hazard may correspond to the notion of incertitude. But it must not be confused with an error and it implies that which is unforeseeable. It is important that physicians stall the faith in the power of ultramodern techniques. Conversely, they should not claim a right to systematic error, when errors in fact hide authentic faults. The medical discourse must therefore remain responsible...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{accuracy}} of home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) depends on {{adherence to the}} measurement schedule. We investigated the number of <b>deviations</b> from the <b>requested</b> schedule using an HBPM device equipped with a diagnostic mode that only allows patients to take a fixed number of BP readings at preset times. Methods We randomized patients to measure their BP as recommended by the European Society of Hypertension guideline in either the usual mode or the diagnostic mode. Results A total of 135 patients were included, mean age 54. 4 +/- 13. 6 years, 57 (42. 2 %) men, with a mean systolic BP of 147. 0 +/- 18. 4 mmHg and a mean diastolic BP of 88. 0 +/- 10. 3 mmHg. In 66 patients, BP was measured in the diagnostic mode, whereas in 69 patients BP was measured in the usual mode. In the diagnostic mode, 40 % of patients showed full adherence to the measurement schedule, compared with 23 % of patients in the usual mode (P= 0. 02). Unscheduled measurements were performed by 55 % of patients measuring BP in the usual mode and none in the diagnostic mode. The number of patients who omitted readings was similar in the diagnostic and the usual mode (P= 0. 9). Compared with scheduled readings only, 12 % of patients measuring BP in the usual mode fell into a different BP category, whereas reclassification did not occur in patients using the diagnostic mode (P= 0. 03). Conclusion HBPM in the diagnostic mode almost doubled {{the number of patients}} with full adherence to the measurement schedule and eliminated the number of patients who were reclassified in a different BP category.

40|$|Background Consensus {{dictates}} that devices used for home blood pressure (BP) measurement should {{be equipped with}} a memory to store readings, rather than trusting patients' logbooks. However, data entered in the memory rely on patients' adherence to measurement schedules. We investigated the number and relevance of <b>deviations</b> from the <b>requested</b> measurement schedule. Methods We instructed 106 patients to perform 28 BP readings in a 2 -week period with a memory-equipped electronic device. Patients were requested to note their scheduled BP values in their logbook and were not informed {{of the presence of}} a memory function. Results The concordance between all BP recordings in both memory and logbook was 90. 1 % of possible total scheduled readings. The difference in mean BP of all readings from memory compared with all readings from the logbook was - 0. 06 mmHg (95 % confidence interval - 0. 79 to 0. 68) systolic and - 0. 28 mmHg (95 % confidence interval - 0. 97 to 0. 40) diastolic. Unscheduled measurements were performed by 57. 5 % of patients. Missing scheduled readings in both logbook and memory were found in 34. 0 % of patients. Fictional data were present for 16. 0 % of patients. When comparing all individual BP readings from the memory and the logbook, 10. 4 % of patients were classified in another hypertension stratum according to the European Society of Hypertension criteria. In 23. 6 % of patients, we did not find any bias. Conclusion In spite of the use of memory-equipped devices, to ensure patients' adherence to measurement schedules, patients still need proper instruction and a close watch.

40|$|Automation {{technology}} in agriculture is growing, making agricultural robotics viable. Innovative field usable multi-purpose robotic platforms {{are needed for}} the successful progression of agricultural robotics. Furthermore, the field of agricultural robotics would benefit from a robotic platform design allowing for variable height, thus accommodating navigation throughout various crop growth stages. A variable height machine, Flex-Ro was developed to accommodate this feature. Multiple sub-assemblies were designed and implemented for Flex-Ro. An electronic control unit (ECU) enabled engine was used to power Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed to control engine speed using proprietary Controller Area Network (CAN) messages in conjunction with J 1939 standard messages. It was observed that the maximum standard <b>deviation</b> from the <b>requested</b> set speed was 8. 423 rpm. A hydrostatic transmission system was designed and implemented on Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed for controlling the pumps and motors of the hydrostatic transmission utilizing proprietary CAN messages. Additionally, the embedded controller operated a Control Cut Off (CCO) that regulated flow to the spring applied motor brakes and the Electronic Displacement Control (EDC) which controls pump flow. Based on the motor speed data collected, {{it was observed that}} an increase in deviation occurred as the operational speed increased with a minimum standard deviation of 6. 98 rpm at 50 RPM and a maximum standard deviation of 36. 13 rpm at 156 RPM. The measured data should be used in developing further higher level control programs. A vertically adjustable frame was developed to allow Flex-Ro to enter crops at various growth stages. A steering system was developed and programmed to allow for steering control through the CAN bus again using proprietary CAN messages. Lastly, a remote control program was developed to allow messages to be created and wirelessly transmitted to Flex-Ro’s CAN bus for teleoperation. Sub-assemblies of Flex-Ro will be further developed for fully autonomous navigation, and performing various field operations. Advisor: Santosh Pitl...|$|R
40|$|Airport {{coordination}} is key in airport scheduling {{activities at}} congested airports. In this strategic capacity management process {{the allocation of}} slots – precisely timed operation permits – is required for every take-off and every landing. At this scheduling stage excess demand may occur {{if the number of}} slot requests exceeds the number of available slots. Conflict resolution includes both rescheduling and rejecting slot requests. Consequently, airport access cannot be realized as planned by some airlines. This dissertation’s objective is the development of a standardized approach to evaluate the scheduling and slot allocation process. This evaluation is based on the feasibility for demanding airlines to access airport infrastructure as requested. Therefore the term “scheduled delay” – defined as difference between requested and allocated slot times – is introduced as performance indicator. Scheduled delays allow assessing airport coordination results quantitatively and transparently with regard to airport access and can account for an airport’s scheduling performance. Because this approach is unique in air transportation sciences until now, the possible usage of scheduled delays has been discussed accordingly. In Section 1 of this thesis the feasibility to access airport infrastructure due to slot allocation decisions is introduced as a relevant performance aspect in airport coordination. Airport access is required by airlines to offer transport services. Operational restrictions as well as passenger habits determine the required access times. Slots will not be allocated as requested, if conflict resolution due to excess demand requires rescheduling or rejection of some slots at least. This scheduling performance aspect impacts on both airline and passenger habits. Section 2 focuses on the airport coordination process itself. With airport coordination data being available for German coordinated airports (schedule periods Summer 2005 and Winter 2005 / 2006), a detailed process analysis is based on the developments at those airports. The results of this analysis allow abstracting the airport coordination process in Section 3. Slot demand (input parameter and system load), conflict resolution (service process) and allocated slots (output parameter and system throughput) are classified as relevant parameters and dependencies of airport coordination. Scheduled delay is defined as scheduling performance indicator. It measures the temporal <b>deviation</b> between <b>requested</b> slot time and allocated slot time as resulting from conflict resolution. A delay analysis shows significant differences at German coordinated airports with regard to scheduling performance. The empirical results confirm the assumption that when slot utilization (slot demand vs. slot capacity) increases, the average scheduled delays per allocated slot will rise. Since the available airport coordination data does not allow a precise and complete reproduction of this interdependency, a deterministic model approach is defined to predict scheduled delays depending on the level of slot utilization. The conflict resolution as focal part of the airport coordination is modeled. Section 4 finally discusses the possible implementation of scheduled delays in airport planning and management. Now a systematic airport performance measurement framework can be established including both airport scheduling and day-to-day operations. The performance indicator‘s contribution to addressing airport capacity and design issues is focal in its possible usage. An airport’s capability and sufficiency to cope with the given demand can be indicated reliably...|$|R
