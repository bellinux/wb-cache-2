500|$|The {{bird's-eye view}} of the {{engraving}} by Étienne Dupérac shows Michelangelo's solution {{to the problems of}} the space in the Piazza del Campidoglio. Even with their new facades centering them on the new palazzo at the rear, the space was a trapezoid, and the facades did not face each other squarely. [...] Worse still, the whole site sloped (to the left in the engraving). Michelangelo's solution was radical. The three remodelled palazzi enclose a harmonious trapezoidal space, approached by the ramped staircase called the [...] "Cordonata". The stepped ramp of the cordonata was intended, like a slow-moving escalator, to lift its visitors toward the sky and deposit them on the threshold of municipal authority. Since no [...] "perfect" [...] forms would work within the dimension of the plaza, his apparent oval in the paving is actually egg-shaped, narrower at one end than at the other. The oval shape combined with the diamond pattern within it was a play on the previous Renaissance geometries of the circle and square. [...] The travertine design set into the paving is perfectly level: Around its perimeter, low steps arise and die away into the paving as the slope requires. Its centre springs slightly, so that one senses that he/she is standing on the exposed segment of a gigantic egg all but buried at the centre of the city at the centre of the world, as Michelangelo's historian Charles de Tolnay pointed out. An interlaced twelve-pointed star makes a subtle reference to the constellations, revolving around this space called Caput mundi, Latin for [...] "head of the world." [...] This paving design was never executed by the popes, who may have detected a subtext of less-than-Christian import, but Benito Mussolini ordered the paving completed to Michelangelo's design in 1940. [...] Michelangelo looked at the center to find a solution to the Capitoline disorder. [...] The statue provided a center and a focus. [...] The buildings defined the space, and it is this space as much as the buildings, that is the impressive achievement of the Capitoline complex. It is a giant outdoor room, a plaza enclosed and protected but open to the sky and accessible through five symmetrical openings. Axiality and symmetry govern all parts of the Campidoglio. [...] The aspect of the piazza that makes this most immediately apparent is the central statue, with the paving pattern directing the visitors’ eyes to its base. [...] Michelangelo also gave the medieval Palazzo del Senatore a central campanile, a renovated façade, and a grand divided external staircase. [...] He designed a new façade for the colonnaded Palazzo dei Conservatori and projected an identical structure, the Palazzo Nuovo, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the piazza. [...] On the narrow side of the trapezoidal plan, he extended the central axis with a magnificent stair to link the hilltop with the city below.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{research}} on two-sided markets {{indicates that the}} two user groups exhibit different kinds of network effects (Katz and Shapiro 1985; Liebowitz and Margolis 1994). Users may derive positive cross-side network effects (CNEs) from the participation of members {{on the other side}} of the market, which means the larger the installed user base on one side of the platform, the more attractive <b>the</b> service <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side’s</b> users (Armstrong 2006; Li et al. 2010; Tucker and Zhang 2010). Network effects can also emerge within one user group, known as same-side network effects (SNEs). For example, a new eBay seller can have a negative effect on other sellers because he or she increases competition between sellers and may snatch away potential buyers (Kraemer et al. 2012; Li et al. 2010).|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of the study of Ref. [10], the test samples were {{relatively}} simple, namely a training set of pharmaceutical compacts with varying porosity composing of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and air voids. However, there are some interesting features in that study which we wish to revisit before proceeding. One conclusion made was that the measured average surface roughness and the gloss have a linear correlation. Another observation was that although a tablet set consisted of tablets that have varied nominal porosity (volumetric property), the gloss (surface property) value was different <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> faces of <b>the</b> flat-faced compacts. In other words, such tablets have different surface roughness/surface porosity due to the compression cycle based on using a dye with upper and lower punches.

One issue confronting the dual role of teacher-researcher {{is the nature of}} interaction between the underlying goals that come with each of these roles. There are some researchers who express concern that the combination of these goals within the teacher-researcher may compromise either or both of the work of teaching and research in an unproductive way. This paper is an account of my 1 adventure in attempting to fulfil both teaching and research goals in my work as teacher-researcher in a year 7 (Secondary One) geometry class in Singapore.

PATIENT AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who sustained a fingertip injury were treated with occlusive dressing. Two prospective studies: a clinical analysis of the aesthetics and the functional results, a biologic analysis of the dressings in order to search microorganisms, cytokines, and growth factors. RESULTS: Among 15 patients reviewed, the healing was acquired in 2. 7 weeks (2. 5). The thickness of the fingertip was excellent in 30 % and good in 70 %. The Weber test was 3. 8 mm for the fingertip reconstruction against 3 mm <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side.</b> The analysis of the dressing exudates brings to light a pullulement of saprophyte bacterium of the skin but also pathologic species, and presence of angiogenic factors (PDGF, VEGF, EGF).

Also one-way transparent sheets with controllable co-polarized reflection and transmission from <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> are feasible. We show that particular non-reciprocal magneto-electric coupling inside the sheet is necessary to realize lossless non-active transparent sheets. Furthermore, we derive the required polarizabilities of constituent dipole particles such that the layers composed of them form one-way transparent sheets. We conclude with design and simulations of an example of a nonreciprocal one-way transparent sheet functioning as an isolating twist-polarizer. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
