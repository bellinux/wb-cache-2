40|$|Animal {{welfare and}} {{environmental}} protection are increasingly important. Housing systems must be found that offer animal welfare and emit little ammonia, and greenhouse gases. The straw flow system is an animal friendly housing system for fattening pigs. The pen is separated into a lying area and an excre-tion area. In the lying area, straw is used. The pigs keep the lying area dry and clean and excrete on slats {{in the rear of}} the pen. The system can be operated economically efficient on commercial farms. It was to be investigated, if this animal friendly housing system offered environmental benefits and if it emitted less ammonia and greenhouse gases than a conventional fully or partly slatted system. Emissions of NH 3, N 2 O, and CH 4 were measured at a commercial farm. The animal house consisted of three fully separated com-partments. Each compartment was forced ventilated by a central exhaust fan. The compartments were sepa-rated into 16 pens that held 10 – 12 pigs. Gas concentrations were measured with high resolution FTIR spectrometry. Ventilation rate was recorded in the central exhaust fan. Measurements coverd all seasons and all stages of fattening. <b>Emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>storage</b> were quantified, as well. Full data evaluation is currently ongoing...|$|E
40|$|Livestock manure {{management}} accounts for almost 10 % {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions from agriculture globally, and contributes an equal proportion to the US methane emission inventory.   Current emissions inventories use emissions factors determined from small-scale laboratory experiments {{that have not been}} compared to field-scale measurements.   We compiled published data on field-scale measurements of greenhouse gas emissions from working and research dairies and compared these to rates predicted by the IPCC Tier 2 modeling approach.   Anaerobic lagoons were the largest source of methane (368 ± 193 kg CH 4 hd- 1 y- 1), more than three times that from enteric fermentation (~ 100 kg CH 4 hd- 1 y- 1).   Corrals and solid manure piles were large sources of nitrous oxide (1. 5 ± 0. 8 and 1. 1 ± 0. 7 kg N 2 O hd- 1 y- 1, respectively).   Nitrous oxide emissions from anaerobic lagoons (0. 9 ± 0. 5 kg N 2 O hd- 1 y- 1) and barns (10 ± 6 kg N 2 O hd- 1 y- 1) were unexpectedly large.   Modeled methane emissions underestimated field-measurement means for most {{manure management}} practices. Modeled nitrous oxide emissions underestimated field-measurement means for anaerobic lagoons and manure piles, but overestimated <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>storage.</b>   Revised emissions factors nearly doubled slurry CH 4 emissions for Europe and increased N 2 O emissions from solid piles and lagoons in the US by an order of magnitude.

40|$|The study {{tested the}} use of dynamic {{floating}} chambers to measure emissions factors of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) <b>from</b> stored pig <b>slurry</b> and measured the variations of the emissions in time and space. In 2006, dynamic floating chambers {{were used for the}} continuous measurement of gaseous <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> two experimental tanks filled with fattening pig slurry stored for two summer months and in a pit filled repeatedly with mixed slurry between October and March. To check the influence of air speed on gaseous emissions, each tank was fitted with a chamber: one operating with an air speed at the surface of the slurry of 0. 01 m/s, the other with a speed of 1 m/s. To ascertain the spatial variability of the emissions, two identical chambers were used for the pit: one was regularly displaced {{across the surface of the}} slurry; the other was fixed throughout the storage period. The measurements obtained were compared with the nitrogen and carbon input-output mass balances of the slurry. The results show that the measured gaseous <b>emissions</b> explain <b>from</b> 4 to 38 % of the total nitrogen losses and from 61 to 285 % of the total carbon losses.

40|$|RONO: 2490 5234 RONO: 2490 4066 Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{following the}} application of livestock slurry to agricultural land is {{a significant source of}} atmospheric NH 3, and not only poses a risk to the environment through eutrophication and acidification of sensitive ecosystems, but may also result in a loss of plant-available nitrogen (N). The band-spread slurry application technologies of trailing hose and trailing shoe have been shown to reduce NH 3 emissions and consequently to increase plant uptake of slurry-applied N. There is a need to improve the precision in calculating the reduction in NH 3 emission nationally and at farm level, and this may be achieved through the development of algorithms that more accurately estimate NH 3 emission and also support the assessment of fertilizer efficiency of slurry that is band-applied to crops. Therefore, this study reviewed studies of NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> band applied with a trailing hose or shoe with the objective of developing an algorithm for calculating the reduction efficiency of the band application technique in relation to crop height. The developed algorithm predicted that for slurry applications to cereal crops, the reduction efficiency would increase by slightly less than 1 % for every 1 cm increase in crop height. For slurry application to grassland, the reduction efficiency was predicted to increase by approximately 5 % for every 1 cm increase in sward height. The developed algorithm was used in combination with the ALFAM model, which predicts NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> applications to bare soil, to provide monthly coefficients for estimating NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> applied to bare soil, cereal crops and grassland for Denmark and Southern England. Inclusion of the crop height algorithm in the emission factor derivation predicted, for example, a decrease in the emission factor for cattle slurry application by trailing hose to winter wheat from c. 25 % to c. 15 % of applied ammoniacal N for applications in January and May, respectively. While the algorithm developed in this study would benefit from wider validation, should more published data become available, the present paper demonstrates its potential value as an educational tool for farmers and advisers in developing more sustainable manure management strategies and for inclusion in emission factor calculations for national inventories to both improve the temporal distribution of <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> application and to better reflect improved management practices of farmers.

40|$|Organic milk {{production}} in Norway {{has become more}} intensive, which, among other things, has led to increased focus on forage quality. The primary growth (PG) is harvested at an earlier stage of development with the consequence {{that more than half}} of the total yearly yield is from the regrowth (RG, second and third cuts). The RG contains a high proportion of clover. Thus, the RG forage has likely high crude protein content, while the PG forage has high energy value but low protein content. The use of fish meal as feed to ruminants is now prohibited, also in Norway, and alternative feed protein sources are expensive. The value of on-farm grown forage is therefore becoming even higher. The project aims to bring to light knowledge that makes dairy farmers better prepared to produce forage in high quantities and qualities as allowed by local climate and resources, adapt forage and {{milk production}} better to these constraints,and assess the economics, resource use and environmental impacts linked to forage production and feed ration with high forage quality. Specifically, the research conducted in the project seeks to answer the following questions: -	Little is known about the yield and forage quality formation in RG and how the RG should be divided between a second and a third cut under different climatic conditions. So when ought the RG to be harvested? -	Are early red clover varieties better suited than late ones in intensive harvesting regimes when it comes to sustain high yields and to even out differences in forage yield and quality between cuts? -	Will other grasses than timothy and meadow fescue perform better as companion species to red clover under intensive harvesting regimes? Are grass species and variety mixtures that are less synchronous in generative development better? -	 How should forage with high clover proportion be preserved in order to ensure high preservation of the forage protein? -	Is it possible to utilize that PG and RG silages have different feed quality by mixing them when fed? What is the best proportion of respective types in rations for high yielding cows? -	What is won and what is lost in economic terms when applying intensive harvesting regime? -	Will a mixing of PG and RG silages at feeding reduce methane emission and nitrogen loss in the cow and from the slurry storage? The primary objective is to improve the basis for tactical and strategic choices in the production, use and utilisation of grassland forage in organic milk production. Secondary objectives are to: 1. Evaluate the potentials and options for legume based boosting of grassland yield 2. Evaluate the RG yield and quality formation 3. Evaluate diets to high yielding dairy cows - balancing PG and RG grass/red clover silage 4. Evaluate the effects of different dietary mixtures of PG and RG on enteric methane emissions and methane and N <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>storage</b> 5.

40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary protein on {{nitrogen}} excretion and ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> of growing-finishing pigs were studied both in vitro {{and in a}} pig house. The three diets had similar contents of NE, minerals, vitamins and ileal digestible lysine, methionine + cystine, threonine and tryptophan, but differed in CP content (16. 5, 14. 5 and 12. 5 %). In the balance experiment, 18 castrated males of about 55 kg body weight were allotted to the three diets. The experiment lasted 9 weeks, which were divided into three 3 -week periods. In each period, urine and faeces were collected separately for 7 days in metabolism cages and mixed as slurry. A sample of this slurry {{was placed in a}} laboratory system to measure ammonia emission for 7 days. In the barn experiment, 216 pigs were housed in three compartments and fed the experimental diets. Ammonia emission was measured directly from the compartments for 7 days during each of the 3 -week periods. There was no effect of dietary CP level on faecal nitrogen excretion. Urinary nitrogen excretion and slurry pH decreased when dietary CP decreased. Both balance and barn experiments showed similar effects of dietary CP on ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry.</b> Ammonia <b>emission</b> was reduced by 10 - 12. 5 % for each percent decrease in dietary CP.

A total of 96 pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 80. 70 ± 2. 29 kg were assigned {{on the basis of}} weight to four treatment groups (6 replicates per treatment and 4 pigs per pen). In this study, dietary L. reuteri led to a higher ATTD of N than the negative groups (P< 0. 05). Pigs fed with soybean hull supplemental diet decreased (P< 0. 05) the fecal NH 3, H 2 S and acetic acid emission compared with those without supplementation.

30|$|The {{rate and}} amount of NH 3 {{emission}} {{were related to the}} kind of fertilizers and interaction of these treatments with soils. Comparison of chemical fertilizers and slurry for NH 3 emission is difficult because the reaction of these two groups of fertilizer is totally different. The amount of emitted NH 3 from different fertilizers was related to the amount of water added to the soil with the application and consequently to the infiltration of the slurry into the soil. It seems that 4  days are enough for the estimation of the NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry,</b> but longer time is needed for chemical fertilizers. The strong linear correlations between the results of the two measurement methods demonstrated that MGM was also utilizable for determination of the total amount of emitted NH 3 in different treatments even though a slight overestimation existed.|$|R
30|$|Application of {{different}} chemical fertilizers and manures {{is a major}} source of ammonia (NH 3) emission. The rate and total amount of NH 3 emission are related to different parameters such as climatic conditions, soil characteristics and kind of fertilizer. The current study has indicated the NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> bovine <b>slurry,</b> pig slurry and ammonium nitrate fertilizer after application on two soils. Two different methods were used to measure NH 3 emissions: the method that use acid traps and the method that use photoacoustic infrared gas analyzer.|$|R
30|$|Soil pH and cation {{exchange}} capacity (CEC) also influenced NH 3 emission. When the fertilizer could infiltrate in the soil, the higher pH of the TF soil enhanced NH 3 emission {{in comparison with the}} soil of Poirino. This confirms that lower pH leads to a lower proportion of aqueous NH 3 and therefore decreases NH 3 emission (Li 2000). Huijsmans et al. (2003) and FAO (2001) reported similar results, in which the increase of pH and decrease of CEC could raise NH 3 emission of 10 times. Soil surface pH greatly changes when slurry is applied to soil, due to the different buffering capacities of the soil and slurry. The highest reaction of NH 3 emission to pH was observed when pH ranges from 7 to 10, and NH 3 emission below 7 decreases dramatically (Hartung and Phillips 1994). Using a mechanistic model for estimating the NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> after application in soil Genermont and Cellier (1997) pH was the main factor that influenced NH 3 emission. They reported that the reduction of the pH from 7 to 6 resulted in 19  % decrease of NH 3 emission.|$|R
40|$|At a {{cropland}} and a grassland site field scale ammonia (NH 3) <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> application {{were determined}} simultaneously by two approaches based on (i) eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements using high temperature Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (HT-CIMS) and on (ii) backward Lagrangian Stochastic (bLS) dispersion modelling using concentration measurements by three optical open path Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) systems. Slurry was {{spread on the}} fields in sequential tracks {{over a period of}} one to two hours. In order to calculate field emissions, measured EC/HT-CIMS fluxes were combined with flux footprint analysis of individual slurry spreading tracks to parameterise the NH 3 volatilisation with a bi-exponential time dependence. Accordingly, track-resolved concentration footprints for the FTIR measurements were calculated using bLS. A consistency test with concentrations measured by impingers showed very low systematic deviations for the EC/HT-CIMS results (< 8 %) but larger deviations for the bLS/FTIR results. For both slurry application events, the period during fertilisation and the subsequent two hours contributed by more than 80 % to the total field emissions.

Various measures {{have been developed to}} mitigate these emissions, but most of these focus on one specific gas and/or emission source. Here, we present a meta-analysis and integrated assessment of the effects of mitigation measures on NH 3, CH 4 and (direct and indirect) N 2 O <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> the whole manure management chain. We analysed the effects of mitigation technologies on NH 3, CH 4 and N 2 O <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> individual sources statistically using results of 126 published studies. Whole-chain effects on NH 3 and GHG emissions were assessed through scenario analysis. Significant NH 3 reduction efficiencies were observed for (i) housing via lowering the dietary crude protein (CP) content (24 – 65 %, compared to the reference situation), for (ii) external <b>slurry</b> <b>storages</b> via acidification (83 %) and covers of straw (78 %) or artificial films (98 %), for (iii) solid manure storages via compaction and covering (61 %, compared to composting), and for (iv) manure application through band spreading (55 %, compared to surface application), incorporation (70 %) and injection (80 %). Acidification decreased CH 4 <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> stored <b>slurry</b> by 87 %. Significant increases in N 2 O emissions were found for straw-covered <b>slurry</b> <b>storages</b> (by two orders of magnitude) and manure injection (by 26 – 199 %).

However, {{it is difficult}} to assess the optimal amount of oxidizing agent required. In this study, one cow and one pig manure, each in three particle size ranges were oxidized with 0 – 350 mg ozone/L manure. Redox and H 2 S concentration were measured continuously. During ozonation the manures gave equivalent redox potential curves. A relatively rapid rise in redox potential was observed within a range of − 275 mV to − 10 mV, with all manures changing as a minimum from − 200 mV to − 80 mV. The gaseous H 2 S emissions were decreased by 99. 5 % during the redox increase (− 200 mV to − 80 mV). This is attributed to H 2 S oxidation by ozone and oxygen, and is not due to H 2 S deprotonation or gas flushing. By identifying the initiation of the final redox level following the rise, the amount of ozone required to remove H 2 S from the manure samples was estimated to be in the range of 6 – 24 mg O 3 /L manure, {{depending on the type of}} manure.

Methane production rates in pig and cattle slurry differed significantly at 0. 030 and 0. 011 kg CH 4 kg- 1 VS (volatile solids). Current estimates of CH 4 <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> pig and cattle manure management correspond to 0. 032 and 0. 015 kg CH 4 kg- 1, respectively, indicating that slurry pits under animal confinements are a significant source. Fractions of degradable volatile solids (VSd, kg kg- 1 VS) were estimated using an aerobic biodegradability assay and total organic C analyses. The VSd in pig and cattle slurry averaged 0. 51 and 0. 33 kg kg- 1 VS, and it was estimated that on average 43 and 28 % of VSd in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, respectively, had been lost at the time of sampling.

The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the slatted floor (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of slurry in the pit) and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the pit. Three different CFD models of a slatted floor were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a slatted floor for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the <b>slurry</b> pit, and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a slatted floor model (SFM) which models the slatted floor as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the slatted floor by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the slurry pit.

Strategies to reduce these emissions include modifying the slurry environment through use of natural and biological additives. In this thesis, two such strategies were explored. The first three experimental chapters explored the potential to mitigate emissions by using inorganic acid (50 % concentrated sulphuric acid H 2 SO 4), fermentable carbohydrates at 10 % w/v to reduce slurry pH, and biological additives (effective microorganisms - EM) at 5 % v/v, to suppress methanogenesis. The addition of a carbohydrate source resulted in ‘self-acidification’ of cattle <b>slurry</b> <b>from</b> average pH 6. 8 to pH’s as low as pH 3. 5 in laboratory and pot-scale experiments, under both warm and cool conditions. The reduced slurry pH inhibited both CH 4 and NH 3 emissions significantly (by between 72 % and 84 % for CH 4, and 57 % and 92 % for NH 3). The use of agriculture food-chain by-products as sources of available carbohydrates, such as brewery spent grains, successfully promoted self-acidification by producing large amounts of lactic acid and reducing the slurry pH to 4. 0. As a result, the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq.; CH 4 +CO 2 +N 2 O) emission was inhibited by 86 %. However, NH 3 emissions were not significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, methane oxidation by methanotrophs within slurry crusts was also explored, but bio-augmentation with EM showed no clear effect on this potential CH 4 sink. The application of self-acidified slurry to ryegrass in a pot experiment demonstrated significant NH 3 and CH 4 inhibition compared to the untreated slurry during the first 48 hours after application. However, plant health was severely affected by the acidic slurry treatment, resulting in plant death in most cases. The mechanism for the self-acidification of slurry was elucidated by a conducting a metagenomic analysis of the slurries immediately after carbohydrate addition, {{and at the end of}} the 30 day storage period. This linked the dominance of Lactobacillales in the self-acidified slurry to the high lactic acid production and reduced pH in the treatments that received the carbohydrate source. The metagenomic analysis also identified groups of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Order Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, as the dominant methanogens in both treated and untreated slurries. The low CH 4 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the self-acidified <b>slurry</b> was associated with low abundance of methanogens. Whilst this study demonstrated the potential for self-acidification of slurry to reduce CH 4 production and emission, as well as reduction in NH 3 <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> stores and following land spreading, further research is necessary to test the strategy at a larger scale, and develop methods that minimize the negative effect of the acidified slurry on soil and plant health, e. g. via slurry injection or incorporation...|$|R

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyzes {{were conducted to}} estimate concentrations of bacteria community harboring specific catabolic nitrifying-ammonium monooxygenase (amoA), and denitrifying nitrate- (narG), nitrite- (nirS and nirG), nitric oxide- (norB) and nitrous oxide reductases (nosZ) genes. NH 3 -N, N 2 O-N, N 2 -N emissions represented 15. 4 ± 1. 9 %, 5. 4 ± 0. 9 %, and 79. 1 ± 2. 0 % of the total nitrogen losses, respectively. Among the genes tested, temporal distribution of narG, nirS, and nosZ concentration correlated significantly (p< 0. 05) with the estimated N 2 emissions.

40|$|Emissions {{of ammonia}} to the {{atmosphere}} are considered {{a threat to the}} environment and both United Nation treaty and European Union legislation increasingly limit emissions. Livestock farming is the major source of atmospheric NH 3 in Europe and field applied manure contributes significantly to the emission of NH 3 from agriculture. This paper presents a review of studies of NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> field-applied animal manure and of the methods available for its reduction. It is shown that there is a complex relationship between the NH 3 <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> and the slurry composition, soil conditions and climate. It is concluded that simple empirical models cannot be used to predict ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the wide range of circumstances found in European agriculture and that a more mechanistic approach is required. NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> applied solid manure and poultry manure has been studied less intensively than slurry but appear to be controlled by similar mechanisms. The use of trail hoses, pre- or post-application cultivation, reduction in slurry viscosity, choice of application rate and timing and slurry injection were considered as reduction techniques. The most effective methods of reducing ammonia emissions were concluded to be incorporation of the animal slurry and farmyard manure or slurry injection. Incorporation should be as close to the application as possible, especially after slurry application, as loss rates are high in the 1 st hours after application. Injection is a very efficient reduction technique, provided the slurry is applied at rates that can be contained in the furrows made by the injector tine. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{performance}} of two inverse dispersion models to quantify ammonia (NH 3) fluxes has been evaluated. Ammonia <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> cattle <b>slurry</b> spreading have been estimated following two different application techniques in northern Italy: (i) surface spreading with incorporation after 24 h and (ii) injection into the soil. Passive diffusion samplers {{were used to}} measure atmospheric ammonia concentrations at the treated fields and at background sites. A sonic anemometer was used to characterise the atmospehric turbulence and provided the necessary inputs for the inverse models. Two inverse dispersion models were then employed: FIDES, based on the Philip (1959) analytical solution of the advection-diffusion equation and WindTrax, a Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model. Both models were parameterised with friction velocity, Obukhov length and roughness as input. WindTrax was also alternatively used with wind components statistics from the sonic anemometer. The two models agreed well in estimating ammonia emissions under neutral conditions but diverged under stable and unstable conditions because of different parameterisation of the diffusivity profile. The maximum {{difference between the two}} models was less than 32 %. The uncertainty associated with the concentration measurements with the passive samplers, was lower than 11 %. The direct injection of slurry into the soil was the most effective method for reducing N loss <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> application, resulting in an emission of 2 % of the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) applied when surface application resulted in losses of 5. 4 % of TAN...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was set-up {{in order to}} assess the difference in odour and ammonia <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> three types of cattle slurry: two coming from farms with different types of housing systems and one from a farm with an anaerobic digestion plant.

The tests were carried out in laboratory conditions, simulating storage conditions similar to those in the farm storage tanks. Measurements were taken on eight sampling occasions with four replicates per each slurry type.

40|$|Ruminant {{husbandry}} {{constitutes the}} most important source of anthropogenic methane (CH 4). In addition to enteric (animal-derived) CH 4, excreta are another source of CH 4, especially when stored anaerobically. Increasing the proportion of dietary concentrate is often considered as the primary CH 4 mitigation option. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this is still valid when diets to be compared are energy-balanced. In addition, non-structural carbohydrates and side effects on nitrogen (N) emissions may be important. In this experiment, diet types representing either forage-only or mixed diets were examined for their effects on CH 4 and N <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> animals and their slurries in 18 lactating cows. Apart from a hay-only diet, treatments included two mixed diets consisting of maize stover, pelleted whole maize plants and gluten or barley straw and grain and soy bean meal. The diets were balanced in crude protein and net energy for lactation. After adaptation, data and samples were collected for 8 days including a 2 -day CH 4 measurement in respiratory chambers. Faeces and urine, combined proportionately according to excretion, were used to determine slurry-derived CH 4 and N emissions. Slurry was stored for 15 weeks at either 14 °C or 27 °C, and temperatures were classified as ‘cool' and ‘warm', respectively. The low-starch hay-only diet had high organic matter and fibre digestibility and proved to be equally effective on the cows' performance as mixed diets. The enteric CH 4 formation remained unaffected by the diet except when related to digested fibre. In this case emission was lowest with the hay-only diet (61 v. 88 to 101 g CH 4 /kg digested NDF). Feeding the hay diet resulted in the highest slurry-CH 4 production after 7 weeks of storage at 14 °C and 27 °C, and after 15 weeks at 14 °C. CH 4 emissions were, in general, about 10 -fold higher at 27 °C compared with 14 °C but only after 15 weeks of storage. Urinary N losses were highest with the barley diet and lowest with the maize diet. There was a trend towards similar differences in N losses <b>from</b> the <b>slurry</b> of these cows (significant at 14 °C). However, contrary to CH 4, slurry-N emissions seemed to be temperature-independent. In conclusion, energetically balanced diets proved to be widely equivalent in their emission potential when combining animal and their slurry, this even at a clearly differing forage : concentrate ratio. The variation in CH 4 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> stored shortly or at cold temperature for 15 weeks was of low importance as such conditions did not support methanogenesis in slurry anywa...|$|R
40|$|Animal manures {{may differ}} {{strongly}} in composition {{and as a}} result may differ in the emission of N 2 O following application to soil. An incubation study was carried out to assess the effects of type of mineral N fertilizer and manure, application technique and application rate on N 2 O <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> a sandy soil with low organic matter content. Fluxes of N 2 O were measured 30 times over a 98 -day period. The total N 2 O <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> mineral N fertilizer ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 0 % of the N applied. High emissions were associated with manures with high contents of inorganic N, easily mineralizable N and easily mineralizable C, such as liquid pig manure (7. 3 - 13. 9 % of the N applied). The <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> cattle <b>slurries</b> ranged <b>from</b> 1. 8 to 3. 0 % and that of poultry manures from 0. 5 to 1. 9 %.

40|$|Ammonia is a {{nuisance}} gas in many swine barns. The overall {{objective of this}} research project was to model ammonia formation and transmission processes in a grower-finisher swine barn, by first modelling the ammonia production and <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> urine puddles on the floor surface and the ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the <b>slurry</b> pit, and then incorporating these emission rates in a dynamic model that separates the room and slurry pit headspace as two separate, but linked, control volumes. A series of studies were conducted to gather {{more information about the}} processes affecting the ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> the floor surface and the slurry that were later included in the overall room model developed. The model was then used to investigate ammonia reducing techniques and technologies based on the understanding of ammonia production and transmission incorporated in the model. The first step in modelling the ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> the floor surface was to determine the frequency of urinations by grower-finisher pigs. Male and female pigs were observed three times during their finishing phase to determine their urination frequency {{over the course of a}} day. The average measured urination frequency was 0. 62 ± 0. 11 urinations pig- 1 h- 1. A sinusoidal dromedary model was developed to describe the daily variation in urination frequency for male and female pigs between 51 and 78 kg. In order for the deposited urinations on the floor surface to emit ammonia, the urea in the urine must first be converted to ammonia and the urease enzyme catalyzes this reaction. Two methods, a fixed-time-point method using the indophenol assay for ammonium-nitrogen analysis and a continuous method using the coupled enzyme assay, were used to measure enzyme activity at the floor surface of a swine barn and were compared to reported urease activity levels in the literature. Using both methods, there appeared to be an ammonia-producing site on the floor surface or within the collected samples that made accurate measurements of urease activity impossible. A review of urease activity levels in the literature from dairy-cow houses suggest that urease activity will be lowest following floor-cleaning and increase quickly following fouling of the floor surface. Based on the literature review, a urease activity value of 5 g NH¬ 3 m- 2 h- 1 was suggested for use in ammonia emission modelling of fouled floor surfaces in swine barns until better measurements become available. The ammonia <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> 36 simulated urine puddles under a variety of temperature, air velocity and initial urea concentration conditions were measured in a bench-scale experimental set-up. The measurements were used to calibrate and validate a dynamic, mechanistic, urine puddle emission model that considered the processes of evaporation, urea conversion, change in liquid concentration and puddle pH in order to simulate the amount of ammonia emitted from a puddle. Based on the correlation coefficients (R) between measured and simulated values for water volume (R= 0. 99), total ammoniacal nitrogen concentration (R= 0. 90), and total emission (R= 1. 00), along with five other statistical tests for each simulated variable, the model was deemed accurate. The measurements and simulations in this experiment showed the impact of puddle pH, urease activity and changing environmental conditions on the average puddle emission rate. Puddle emission continued to occur as long as there was still water. The impact of different slurry compositions on the ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> pits was tested in another bench-scale experimental set-up with emission chambers. The emission chamber concentration data collected was used to calibrate and validate a developed slurry emission model. The collected slurry samples were concentrated mixtures of urine and feces from individually-housed animals fed different diets. An empirical equation was developed to express the amount of total ammoniacal nitrogen in the slurry that was in the form of ammonia (f) and thus volatile to the surroundings. Based on the empirical equation, the simulated value of f was between 0. 03 and 0. 08 and did not show the sensitivity to slurry pH that has been reported by other authors. The slurry emission model with the empirical equation for f was validated with ammonia <b>emission</b> measurements <b>from</b> eight different <b>slurry</b> samples and simulated hourly concentration measurements within 17 % and five-day average concentration measurements within 3 %. Further testing was recommended to ensure the model developed for concentrated manure in this study was applicable to the more dilute slurry found in swine barns. Using the information gained in the previous experiments, a mechanistic model describing the dynamic ammonia concentration in the room and in the slurry channel headspace of grower-finisher swine barns, as well as the ammonia emitted to the surrounding environment was developed. Data was collected from two grower-finisher rooms to use as input data to the model and for calibration and validation purposes. The model calibration procedure determined that the amount of <b>emissions</b> originating <b>from</b> the <b>slurry</b> for the simulated room conditions was generally less than 5 % of the total room emissions, the air exchange rate through the slatted floor was approximately 4 % of the room ventilation rate, and that in the first two weeks of animal activity in a room the urease activity at the floor surface will increase. The model was validated using separate data from that used in the calibration process. The model simulated hourly room concentration levels within 2. 2 ppm and 3 -day average concentration levels within 1. 6 ppm. The model simulations were more accurate for one room that was fed a typical grower-finisher diet compared to another room fed an experimental diet with lower protein content and sugar-beet pulp inclusion. The dynamic model was tested for its sensitivity to various input factors in terms of the floor emission rate, slurry emission rate and total emission rate. An interesting aspect of the simulations was that increases in either floor or surface emission rate were compensated to a small extent by decreases in the other emission rate as a result of a reduced concentration gradient for mass transfer. The ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> the floor was most sensitive to changes in urease activity, fouled floor area and puddle area. The ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> was most sensitive to changes in slurry pH. The impact of input variables on the total emission rate was dependant on the simulated proportion of the total ammonia <b>emission</b> coming <b>from</b> either the floor surface or slurry channel. Three ammonia reduction techniques were tested and evaluated on their impact to the total ammonia <b>emission</b> rate <b>from</b> a room compared to a given set of control conditions. The work in this thesis highlighted the importance of ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> the floor surface. The proportion of ammonia originating <b>from</b> the <b>slurry</b> and <b>from</b> the floor surface respectively will vary on the specific conditions within the barn, and will impact the effect of any ammonia mitigation technique that is investigated or used...|$|R
40|$|The {{splash plate}} slurry {{spreader}} is inexpensive and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to slurry spreaders that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 <b>emissions</b> come <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and injector slurry spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional splash plate machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> spreaders is in the order; (splash plate) >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a splash plate and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a fixed displacement pump achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P <b>from</b> <b>slurry</b> but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a fixed displacement pump which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This slurry spreader would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than splash plate machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting <b>slurry,</b> and reducing <b>emissions</b> <b>from</b> livestock housing and <b>slurry</b> <b>storage.</b> With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients. The cost of providing this equipment on Irish farms is likely to be between € 200 m and € 800 m and depends on the options chosen. End of Project Repor...|$|R

Much atmospheric NH 3 is lost from livestock manure applied in the field. The NH 3 emission may be reduced by slurry injection, but slurry injection in general, and especially on grassland, increases the energy demand and places heavy demands on the slurry injection techniques used. The reduction in NH 3 emission, injection efficiency and energy demand of six different shallow slurry-injection techniques was examined. The NH 3 <b>emission</b> <b>from</b> cattle <b>slurry</b> applied to grassland was reduced by all the injectors tested in the study, but there were major differences in the NH 3 reduction potential of the different types of injectors. Compared with the trailing hose spreading technique, the NH 3 loss was reduced by 75 % when cattle slurry was injected using the most efficient slurry injection technique, and by 20 % when incorporated by the least efficient injection technique. The reduction in NH 3 emission was correlated with injection depth and the volume of the slot created. The additional energy demand for reducing ammonia emissions by slurry injection was approximately 13 000 kJ ha- 1 for a 20 % reduction and 34 000 kJ ha- 1 for a 75 % reduction.
