5|$|The LTTE, {{also known}} as Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, an insurgent group in Sri Lanka used CS gas against {{government}} forces in September 2008. Its use hindered the army's progress but ultimately proved <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> preventing the army from overrunning LTTE positions.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Ineffective {{triggering}} is frequent during pressure support ventilation (PSV). Its occurrence {{is favored}} by dynamic hyperinflation that may arise when increasing the pressure support level (PSL). Decreasing the PSL however fails to suppress <b>ineffective</b> triggering <b>in</b> a subgroup of patients that are therefore exposed to refractory ineffective triggering. Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV +) decreases {{the incidence of}} <b>ineffective</b> triggering <b>in</b> unselected patients but its effect on refractory asynchrony during PSV is unknown.|$|R

5|$|The US 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division was <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> {{its first}} showing. The regiment, {{composed}} mostly of black troops, was {{criticized by the}} Army for being quick to panic and retreat. Some historians have described the Army's statements as biased, downplaying the regiment's successes and overstating its failures.|$|E
5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> {{stopping}} the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the salient characteristics of trained <b>ineffective</b> teachers <b>in</b> secondary schools in Kenya. Participants comprised 80 students from eight schools drawn from four provinces in the country. Of the 80 participants, 40 were females and 40 were males. This qualitative research adopted phenomenological design. Two research instruments—a biographical form and a blank sheet of paper—were used in data collection. Content analysis method was used in analyzing the written and nonquantitative data collected. Results of data analysis revealed 20 salient characteristics of trained <b>ineffective</b> teachers <b>in</b> secondary schools. These characteristics are as follows: wastage of students’ time, poor mastery of the subject, source of boredom to students, partial treatment of students, {{lack of respect for}} students, low level of self-confidence, poor mastery of teaching skills, emotional immaturity, inappropriate dressing, injurious to students, fond of frivolous talk, miscommunicate in class, poor in providing feedback, nondialogical in class, poor in maintaining discipline, immoral in behavior, unapproachable to students, poor in counseling, poor psychological health, and autocratic to students. The findings of this study may be useful to stakeholders in education in developing instruments that may be used to identify <b>ineffective</b> teachers <b>in</b> schools...|$|R

5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|As the Parliament {{buildings}} {{had been}} lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker {{was forced to}} wait until the fall to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions. The Liberals were <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> opposition, with the party {{in the midst of a}} leadership race after St. Laurent's resignation as party leader.|$|E

5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he {{addressed}} the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely <b>ineffective.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven <b>ineffective</b> <b>in</b> addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E
