After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more.

He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time – you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, I think. There is, also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria is a very interesting piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue there. You can tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra.
