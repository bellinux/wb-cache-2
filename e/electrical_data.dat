2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the <b>electrical</b> <b>data</b> and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the <b>electrical</b> resistivity <b>data</b> provides useful information for investigating and modeling the fluid transport processes. 3 D electrical resistivity distribution provides information about water flow and changes in electrical resistivity of the pore fluid. Therefore, to assist in understanding and modeling of the fluid transport process, 3 D {{spatial distribution}} of the <b>electrical</b> resistivity <b>data</b> with the corresponded 3 D geological section were mapped and interpreted in the test site located in western Germany. A process of deriving electrical resistivity values from the mechanical and radioactive parameters of cone penetration tests (CPT) and geological information of boreholes was presented. A reliable method which gives accurate resistivity values in cases of near surface sediments was introduced. Then a field test was executed where the calculated resistivity values were compared with the measured CPTe resistivity data. The CPTe (cone penetration test with <b>electrical</b> extension) <b>data</b> were also used in correlating to the ERT (<b>electrical</b> resistivity tomography) <b>data.</b> Consequently, obtained dense CPT surveys give us the possibility to determine a high resolution resistivity distribution of the investigated area.

50|$|A CBM {{consists}} of two components: the active common berthing mechanism (ACBM) and the passive common berthing mechanism (PCBM). Once connected, {{the two sides of}} the CBM form a pressure tight seal. The CBM also features a hatch, which can be opened to reveal a 50 inch (127 cm) diameter passage for crew/cargo transfer. Since this passage is large enough to allow International Standard Payload Racks to fit, payloads can be pre-configured in racks and transported to the station aboard the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules, which use CBM ports. Once the hatches have been opened, <b>electrical,</b> <b>data,</b> and fluid lines can be manually connected through the CBM vestibule by the crew.|$|E
