40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a coherent conceptual framework for <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> The paper discusses the field of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> as represented by existing analyses of author affiliations, and a distinction is introduced between <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at institutional level and <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at conceptual level. Conceptual frameworks should be founded on concepts. One of the challenges of developing a framework is to delimit the area of inquiry. Is <b>information</b> <b>management</b> a discipline in its own right, or is <b>information</b> <b>management</b> several disciplines? Little research has examined <b>information</b> <b>management</b> in a disciplinary perspective. It is argued that an exploration of the components of a discipline is important as a foundation for development of a conceptual framework for <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that <b>information</b> <b>management</b> has three different underlying concepts: <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 1 : <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at institutional level. <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 2 : content-oriented <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> rooted in <b>information</b> science and <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 3 : technology-oriented <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> rooted in <b>information</b> systems. A coherent conceptual framework that incorporates disciplinary perspectives may provide a new theoretical understanding that helps us conceptualize the identity of <b>information</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{different}} engineering background and limited technical prerequisites, trade-offs are needed when managing information in complex product development. The challenges faced with <b>information</b> <b>management</b> for complex product development {{are as much}} of organizational as technical character. <b>Information</b> <b>management</b> has in this thesis been analyzed from both a technical and organizational dimension {{in order to obtain}} an integrated view and holistic understanding. The technical dimension focuses on <b>information</b> <b>management</b> systems, such as product lifecycle <b>management</b> systems. An <b>information</b> <b>management</b> system in itself does not solve problems in an organization; it manages at its best all types of business data while storing and retrieving information. In order to succeed, <b>information</b> <b>management</b> needs to be aligned with different needs and with a variety of domain-specific work procedures. The organizational dimension includes organizational structures, work procedures, and the designer and management perspectives on needs and benefits with <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> Perceived benefits with integrated <b>information</b> <b>management</b> are identified as support for SE, work procedure mapping, use of disciplinary support tools, and data integrity and availability. Five technical and organizational key success factors for efficient <b>information</b> <b>management</b> are presented; usability, integration of information, motivation, information structure and organizational support. It is concluded that structured <b>information,</b> <b>management</b> support and motivation among designers are more important than customization of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> systems in order to achieve integrated <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> QC 2010111...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> in New Zealand's coastal zone was carried out. This examination focussed on {{information relating to}} coastal processes and dynamics. It was recognised that decision makers require information on coastal processes and dynamics to make competent decisions about future developments in the coastal zone. The examination involved identifying the existing <b>information</b> <b>management</b> framework. From this examination a number of inadequacies were found that related to; the funding structure, research and survey structure, mandates, and information transfer. A model framework was developed from the literature which outlined the fundamental requirements of <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> The existing <b>information</b> <b>management</b> framework was examined {{in light of this}} model framework. From this examination, two general problems with the existing <b>information</b> <b>management</b> framework were identified; the <b>information</b> <b>management</b> framework is not clearly defined, and there is no central <b>information</b> <b>management</b> agency. The general conclusion drawn from the examination was that <b>information</b> <b>management</b> in coastal zone management is inadequate. This inadequacy has several serious implications for future coastal zone management. A number of options were developed to address <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> These options were; do nothing, specific and incremental adjustments, and implications of each option for coastal zone management policy are discussed along with their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
