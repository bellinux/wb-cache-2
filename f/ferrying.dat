5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} on 25 August 1917, Nairana {{was assigned}} to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow, carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft. She saw little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and <b>ferrying</b> aircraft to ships equipped with flying-off decks.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{surrender}} in May 1945, she {{sailed to}} Norway and escorted two surrendered German cruisers from Denmark to the UK.

5|$|Cummings {{was among}} the first people {{accepted}} into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939. She completed an advanced aerobatics course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor. Having been recruited by Jacqueline Cochran, Cummings joined the Women's Auxiliary <b>Ferrying</b> Squadron in 1942, which soon became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). After graduating from training in Houston in May 1943, she served in World War II until the organization's deactivation in December 1944. During this time, {{she was a member of}} the 6th <b>Ferrying</b> Group out of Long Beach, California, eventually reaching the rank of First Lieutenant, and flew 18 different types of military aircraft. In the same month as her unit's deactivation, she married fellow military pilot Howard Critchell, whom she had a met at a base that was used as a ferry stop for the WASP.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, several MV-22s {{received}} {{communications and}} seating modifications {{to support the}} Marine One presidential transport squadron due to {{the urgent need for}} CH-53Es in Afghanistan. On 11 August 2013, two MV-22s from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) made their debut <b>ferrying</b> Secret Service agents, White House staff, and press members from CGAS Cape Cod to Martha's Vineyard during the President's vacation. In May 2010, Boeing announced plans to submit the V-22 for the VXX presidential transport replacement.|$|E
5|$|New {{organizations}} were formed and new cross ocean routes {{were established in}} the face of the enemy and under difficult conditions. George took the <b>ferrying</b> command from 130 obsolescent aircraft to 3,000 modern military transports, and expanded the personnel from 11,000 to 300,000. For this major contribution to his country, George received the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal, as well as decorations from Great Britain, France, Brazil, Peru and China.|$|E

In March 1947, the Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> Company was established as a joint venture between the government and various private <b>ferry</b> companies and original <b>ferry</b> lines were being restored. By 1949, the Shanghai <b>Ferry</b> Company operated 4 <b>ferry</b> lines across the river, one long-haul <b>ferry</b> route, and one <b>ferry</b> route for automobiles with 19 <b>ferry</b> boats, 13 steel floating docks, and 2 wooden docks.ã€‚ ...|$|R
50|$|Double-ended <b>ferries</b> have {{interchangeable}} {{bows and}} sterns, {{allowing them to}} shuttle {{back and forth between}} two terminals without having to turn around. Well-known double-ended <b>ferry</b> systems include the Staten Island <b>Ferry,</b> Washington State <b>Ferries,</b> Star <b>Ferry,</b> several boats on the North Carolina <b>Ferry</b> System, and the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. Most Norwegian fjord and coastal <b>ferries</b> are double-ended vessels. All <b>ferries</b> from southern Prince Edward Island to the mainland of Canada are double-ended.

5|$|On 24 October 2007, Secretary of the Air Force Wynne {{told the}} House Armed Services Committee that he {{believed}} that the 5th Bomb Wing could be recertified and could resume <b>ferrying</b> the AGM-129 cruise missiles to Barksdale for retirement. He did not provide a timeline for that recertification process. On 1 November 2007 Colonel Joel Westa took command of the 5th Bomb Wing. That same day, General Keys retired from the Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic privately {{operated}} ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) {{were initially}} a primitive affair. In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe <b>ferrying</b> him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Stalingrad Front {{forces were}} subject to heavy bombardment, making {{mobilization}} more difficult. The 38 engineer battalions allocated to the front were responsible for <b>ferrying</b> ammunition, personnel and tanks across the Volga River while carrying out minor reconnaissance along sections of the front which were to be the breakthrough points of the impending offensive. In three weeks the Red Army transported around 111,000 soldiers, 420 tanks and 556 artillery pieces across the Volga.|$|E

5|$|After quick repairs, which {{included}} the removal of several rows of turbine blades, Furious returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed Royal Air Force 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at Bardufoss was ready. One Gladiator and the guiding Swordfish crashed en route, killing all crewmen. The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off, carrying only six Sea Gladiators of 804 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 816 Squadron for self-protection while <b>ferrying</b> 263 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was <b>ferrying</b> much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's {{doctor on}} board the Demodocus, a steam liner <b>ferrying</b> {{supplies}} to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), but had to falsify his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering them from a Kuomintang officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E

50|$|The New York and Brooklyn Union <b>Ferry</b> Company was {{organized}} in 1839, and leased the Fulton <b>Ferry</b> Company and South <b>Ferry</b> Company. It was reorganized in 1844 as the Brooklyn Union <b>Ferry</b> Company, and leased the Hamilton Avenue <b>Ferry</b> in 1851. The {{creation of the}} Union <b>Ferry</b> Company of Brooklyn was authorized by the New York State Legislature on April 9, 1853, and on November 10, 1854 it was formed to replace the Brooklyn Union. It consolidated with the operating companies of four other ferries: the Roosevelt Street <b>Ferry</b> from the Roosevelt <b>Ferry</b> Company, the Gouverneur Street <b>Ferry</b> and Catherine <b>Ferry</b> from Smith & Bulkley, and the Wall Street <b>Ferry</b> from J.

A fifth <b>ferry,</b> the Berowra Waters <b>Ferry,</b> crosses a side-arm of the river.|$|R
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains <b>ferrying</b> materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of those first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost Â£2,000.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939â€“40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and {{had to settle for}} making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot <b>ferrying</b> engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until he was assigned to flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1941, Lexington was <b>ferrying</b> 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers to Midway Atoll and at {{that time}} she {{embarked}} 65 of her own aircraft, including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters. During the Wake Island relief expedition later that month, Saratogas air group consisted of 13 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, 42 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers. The ship also carried 14 Marine Corps Buffalos for delivery at Wake. Before the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in mid-1942, Saratogas air group consisted of 90 aircraft, comprising 37 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. In early 1945, the ship carried 53 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 17 Avengers.|$|E

5|$|Nairana was {{returned}} to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, {{and spent the next}} 27 years <b>ferrying</b> passengers and cargo between Tasmania and Melbourne. She was twice struck by rogue waves in Bass Strait, and nearly capsized on both occasions. Nairana was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the Second World War, and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was laid up in 1948, wrecked in a storm three years later and scrapped in situ in 1953â€“54.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Sasanian rafts <b>ferrying</b> troops across the Bosphorus was {{surrounded}} and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from 6 to 7 August also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to threaten Constantinople seriously again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.|$|E
