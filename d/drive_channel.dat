40|$|As {{with all}} ligand-gated ion channels, ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (iGluRs) convert the free energy of agonist-binding into {{a sequence of}} conformational changes that allow regulated ion flux across an otherwise insulating membrane bilayer.

Recent crystallographic analyses of the ligand-binding domains of these receptors have identified conformational changes associated with agonist binding, yielding a working hypothesis of channel function. This opens the way to determining how the domains and subunits are assembled into an oligomeric channel, how the domains are connected, how the channel is formed, and where it is located relative to the ligand-binding domains, all of which govern the processes of channel activation and desensitization...|$|E

Current patterns optimising distinguishability with respect to this constraint are singular functions of the difference of transconductance matrices with respect to the power norm.

40|$|Many firms {{introduce}} electronic {{channels in}} addition to their traditional sales channels and observe increasing buyer adoption rates immediately after the introduction but subsequent declines. Firms must understand the factors that <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> adoption decisions and how these factors change over time and across buyers. Using panel data pertaining to the purchase histories of 683 buyers over a 43 -month period, we estimate a buyer response model that incorporates buyer heterogeneity, channel inertia, and dynamic pricing. We find that channel adoption behavior is both heterogeneous and dynamic, and the firm’s allocation decisions, if not aligned with buyer behavior, can alienate buyers. Based on the parameter estimates from the buyer response model, we propose an alternative channel allocation would enable firms to attract more buyers to the e-channel and improve revenues.

40|$|Agonist binding to {{glutamate}} receptor ion channels occurs {{within an}} extracellular domain (S 1 S 2) that retains ligand affinity when expressed separately. S 1 S 2 is homologous to periplasmic binding proteins, {{and it has}} been proposed that a Venus flytrap-style cleft closure triggers opening of glutamate receptor ion channels. Here we compare the kinetics of S 1 S 2 -agonist binding to those of the periplasmic binding proteins and show that the reaction involves an initial rapid association, followed by slower conformational changes that stabilize the complex: "docking" followed by "locking. " The motion detected here reflects the mechanism by which the energy of glutamate binding is converted into protein conformational changes within S 1 S 2 alone. In the intact channel, these load-free conformational changes are harnessed and possibly modified as the agonist binding reaction is used to <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> opening and subsequent desensitization. Using mutagenesis, key residues in each step were identified, and their roles were interpreted in light of a published S 1 S 2 crystal structure. In contrast to the Venus flytrap proposal, which focuses on motion between the two lobes as the readout for agonist binding, we argue that smaller, localized conformational rearrangements allow agonists to bridge the cleft, consistent with published hydrodynamic measurements...|$|E

40|$|The {{conversion}} of chemical to electrical signals by the AMPA receptors {{is the key}} step by which these proteins control cognitive and motor responses. Here, we have used luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) to gain insight into the conformational changes induced by glutamate binding in the agonist-binding domain in functional AMPA receptors expressed in oocytes and HEK- 293 cells. The LRET-based distances indicate that the interface between the upper lobes of the agonist-binding domain within a dimer is in a decoupled state in the unligated Apo state of the receptor. Agonist binding results {{in the formation of}} the dimer interface in the open-channel form of the receptor. In the continued presence of glutamate when the receptor is primarily in the desensitized state, the dimer interface is decoupled, confirming that the decoupling of the dimer interface leads to channel closure. The LRET distances also indicate that the dimer interface is preformed before activation in the L 484 Y mutation and also is formed in the antagonist (ZK 200775) -bound form of the AMPA receptor. These results suggests that, although the preformation of the interface is not sufficient to <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> activation, it could play a role in the energetics of activation and hence modulation of the receptor by auxiliary proteins or small molecules...|$|E

We found a striking dissociation between effects of FPL on ionic currents, which were modified strongly, and on gating currents, which were not detectably altered. Inward ionic currents were enhanced ∼ 5 -fold for a voltage step from − 90 mV to + 10 mV. Kinetics of activation and deactivation were slowed dramatically at most voltages.

Gating currents were measured using a variety of inorganic ions to block ionic current and also without blockers, by recording gating current at the reversal potential for ionic current (+ 50 mV). Despite the slowed kinetics of ionic currents, FPL had no discernible effect on the fundamental movements of gating charge that <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> gating.

40|$|Despite many success stories, B 2 B {{e-commerce}} penetration remains low. Many firms introduce electronic {{channels in}} addition to their traditional sales channels, but find that buyer usage of the e-channel over time does not keep up with initial expectations. Firms must understand the underlying factors that <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> usage and how these factors change over time and across buyers. Using panel data pertaining to the purchase histories of 683 buyers over a 43 -month period, we estimate a dynamic discrete choice model in a B 2 B setting that (i) recognizes how price, channel inertia, and inventory change over time, (ii) allows buyers to dynamically trade off these factors when making e-channel adoption decisions, and (iii) takes into account buyer heterogeneity. We find that channel usage is both heterogeneous and dynamic across buyers. Our findings reveal the dynamic tradeoff between channel inertia and the adverse price effect, which interact in opposing directions as the e-channel grows more popular over time: price increases resulting from more bids deter buyers, whereas channel inertia built from sampling experience helps retain repeat buyers for the new channel. Second, we find that the buyers ’ size and diversity influence purchase decisions, and the e-channel appears more attractive to small and/or diversified buyers. Based on our analysis, we postulate that the seller’s allocation decisions of products across channels, if not aligned with buyer behavior, can alienate some buyers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{design and}} implementation of continuous time analog filters for two specific applications: wideband analog systems such as disk <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> and low-power wireless applications. Specific focus has been techniques that reduce the power requirements of the overall system either through improvement in architecture or efficiency of the analog building blocks. The first problem that this dissertation addresses is the implementation of wideband filters with high equalization gain. An efficient architecture that realizes equalization zeros by combining available transfer functions associated with a biquadratic cell is proposed. A 330 MHz, 5 th order Gm-C lowpass Butterworth filter with 24 dB boost is designed using the proposed architecture. The prototype fabricated in standard 0. 35 um CMOS process shows - 41 dB of IM 3 for 250 mV peak to peak swing with 8. 6 mW/pole of power dissipation. Also, an LC prototype implemented using similar architecture is discussed in brief. It is shown that, for practical range of frequency and SNR, LC based design is more power efficient than a Gm-C one, though {{at the cost of}} much larger area. Secondly, a complementary current mirror based building block is proposed, which pushes the limits imposed by conventional transconductors on the powerefficiency of Gm-C filters. Signal processing through complementary devices provides good linearity and Gm/Id efficiency and is shown to improve power efficiency by nearly 7 times. A current-mode 4 th order Butterworth filter is designed, in 0. 13 um UMC technology, using the proposed building. It provides 54. 2 dB IM 3 and 55 dB SNR in 1. 3 GHz bandwidth while consuming as low as 24 mW of power. All CMOS filter realization occupies a relatively small area and is well suited for integration in deep submicron technologies. Thirdly, a 20 MHz, 68 dB dynamic range active RC filter is presented. This filter is designed for a ten bit continuous time sigma delta ADC architecture developed specifically for fine-line CMOS technologies. Inverter based amplification and a common mode feedback for such amplifiers are discussed. The filter consumes 5 mW of power and occupies an area of 0. 07 mm 2...|$|E
40|$|River channel confluences {{are widely}} {{acknowledged}} as important geomorphological nodes {{that control the}} downstream routing of water and sediment, and which are locations {{for the preservation of}} thick fluvial deposits overlying a basal scour. Despite their importance, there has been little study of the stratigraphic characteristics of river junctions, or the role of confluence morphodynamics in influencing stratigraphic character and preservation potential. As a result, although it is known that confluences can migrate through time, models of confluence geomorphology and sedimentology are usually presented from the perspective that the confluence remains at a fixed location. This is problematic for a number of reasons, not least of which is the continuing debate over whether it is possible to discriminate between scour that has been generated by autocyclic processes (such as confluence scour) and that driven by allocyclic controls (such as sea-level change). This paper investigates the spatial mobility of river confluences by using the 40 -year record of Landsat Imagery to elucidate the styles, rates of change and areal extent over which large river confluence scours may migrate. On the basis of these observations, a new classification of the types of confluence scour is proposed and applied to the Amazon and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basins. This analysis demonstrates that the drivers of confluence mobility are broadly the same as those that <b>drive</b> <b>channel</b> change more generally. Thus in the GBM basin, a high sediment supply, large variability in monsoonal driven discharge and easily erodible bank materials result in a catchment where over 80 % of large confluences are mobile over this 40 -year window; conversely this figure is < 40 % for the Amazon basin. These results highlight that: i) the potential areal extent of confluence scours is much greater than previously assumed, with the location of some confluences on the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) River migrating over a distance of 20 times the tributary channel width; ii) extensive migration in the confluence location is more common than currently assumed, and iii) confluence mobility is often tied to the lithological and hydrological characteristics of the drainage basins that determine sediment yield...|$|E
