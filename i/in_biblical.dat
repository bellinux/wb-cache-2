5|$|In 1821 Etty's The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) was a {{critical}} success.

5|$|Strongly {{influenced}} by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty became famous for painting nude figures <b>in</b> <b>biblical,</b> literary and mythological settings.

Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist.|$|E

5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life <b>in</b> <b>biblical</b> times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E
5|$|The zirconium-containing mineral zircon {{and related}} {{minerals}} (jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure) were mentioned <b>in</b> <b>biblical</b> writings. The mineral {{was not known}} to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.|$|E
5|$|York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had {{originally}} been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship {{at the age of}} 18 moved to London to become an artist.

Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cleopatra, {{over the next decade}} Etty tried to {{replicate}} its success by painting nude figures <b>in</b> <b>biblical,</b> literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article <b>in</b> <b>Biblical</b> Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers <b>in</b> <b>Biblical</b> infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
