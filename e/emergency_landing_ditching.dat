As they prepared for an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> (<b>ditching),</b> multiple warnings sounded in the cockpit. The Captain then ordered the First Officer to open the emergency hatch. The ATC asked the crew to confirm the emergency. As the First Officer confirmed the emergency, the aircraft impacted water.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{certification}} {{requires the}} analysis of water <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> (<b>ditching)</b> with respect to passenger safety. In order to support the design and certification processes, models for numerical simulation of aircraft ditching are being developed. Following the work developed in the SMAES project (SMart Aircraft in Emergency Situations, 2011 - 2014), which consisted in the enhancing of simulation capabilities for aircraft ditching analysis, DLR is transferring the acquired knowledge to full-scale aircraft ditching. Due to the complexity involved in fullscale modeling, a pre-processing tool is currently under development for an automatic model generation of full-scale aircraft ditching models for the explicit solver Virtual Performance Solution (VPS). The overall goal of this work is to implement and validate an aerodynamic model in the numerical simulation to allow an improvement {{in the state of}} the art of full-scale aircraft ditching. The developed model physically calculates the loads with proper aerodynamic equations and strongly improves the predictability of loads occurring during a ditching simulation. For the implementation of the aerodynamic model in the numerical simulation, the creation of a new module in the pre-processing tool is proposed. The aerodynamic calculation of lift, drag and pitch moment, based on the evolution of the angle of attack and ight velocity, is accomplished with the implementation of an external user subroutine within the numerical simulation. The superiority of the developed aerodynamic model over the state of the art is demonstrated based on comparison of results of sensitivity and parameter studies...|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "water landing" [...] is {{also used}} as a {{euphemism}} for crash-landing into water an aircraft not designed for the purpose, an event formally termed ditching. In this case, the flight crew knowingly make a controlled <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> on water. <b>Ditching</b> of commercial aircraft is a rare occurrence.|$|R
50|$|During the war, the Japanese Imperial Navy {{constructed}} a seaplane base at Rekata Bay {{in the middle}} of 1942. It was used for offensive operations, mainly the nightly Washing Machine Charlie raids on Henderson Field, Guadalcanal. It was also used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> and <b>ditching</b> area for aircraft damaged during the Battle of Guadalcanal. The base was bombed by U.S. forces from August 1942 to August 1943. In the following month, the Japanese evacuated the base. A U.S. Navy team flew in during 1943 and examined 15 wrecked Japanese aircraft. A single PBY from No. 6 Squadron RNZAF finally visited the abandoned base on 28 August 1945, losing a man, who was possibly eaten by a saltwater crocodile.|$|R

50|$|The {{base was}} used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> site on two {{occasions}} after its closure. A de Havilland Vampire FB.5 from Anglesey made a successful <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> on the old runway after experiencing mechanical problems. A Bristol Beaufighter in a separate incident also attempted an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> but sadly crashed short of the runway with no survivors.|$|R
50|$|Surviving {{passenger}} Jaromír Kratochvíl later {{claimed in}} an interview that flight captain requested <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> in Brno but it was rejected because of the Vietnamese delegation visiting the city and an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> would harm the image of the country. He also claimed that Vienna airport offered an <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> permission but communist authorities rejected it. It is unclear how a surviving passenger would be aware of the captain's actions during the flight, or how searching for an alternate <b>emergency</b> <b>landing</b> site relates to an unstablilized approach with inadvertent thrust reversal deployment at Bratislava.|$|R

It was also known as Pagehurst <b>Emergency</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground. Later serving as a civil <b>Emergency</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground, the airfield closed in 1935.
