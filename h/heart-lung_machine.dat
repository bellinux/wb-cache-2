25|$|<b>Heart-Lung</b> <b>Machine,</b> {{a method}} in which blood is {{diverted}} to an artificial <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> and directed {{back into the}} patient.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} include pacemakers, infusion pumps, the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine,</b> dialysis machines, artificial organs, implants, artificial limbs, corrective lenses, cochlear implants, ocular prosthetics, facial prosthetics, somato prosthetics, and dental implants.|$|E
25|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a {{technique}} in which <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> temporarily takes over {{the function of the}} heart and lungs during surgery. The CPB is operated by the perfusionist, during the heart operation the perfusionist takes over the heart function. The perfusionist works in close relation with the anesthesiologist and the surgeon.|$|E
5000|$|Life support {{equipment}} {{is used to}} maintain a patient's bodily function. This includes medical ventilators, incubators, anaesthetic <b>machines,</b> <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> ECMO, and dialysis machines.|$|R
50|$|Heparin-coated blood oxygenators are {{available}} for use in <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines.</b> Among other things, these specialized oxygenators are thought to improve overall biocompatibility and host homeostasis by providing characteristics {{similar to those of}} native endothelium.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s, induced {{hypothermia}} {{has been}} performed for some open-heart surgeries {{as an alternative}} to <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines.</b> Hypothermia, however, provides only a limited amount of time in which to operate and there is a risk of tissue and brain damage for prolonged periods.|$|R
25|$|At age 23, {{while still}} in medical school at Tulane University, DeBakey {{developed}} the roller pump, the significance of which was not realized until 20 years later when it became {{an essential component of}} the <b>heart–lung</b> <b>machine.</b> The pump provided a continuous flow of blood during operations. This, in turn, made open-heart surgery possible.|$|E
25|$|Minimaze {{procedures}} are minimally invasive {{versions of the}} original Cox maze procedure but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or cardiopulmonary bypass (<b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine).</b> They use laser, cryothermy, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.|$|E
25|$|Dr. John Heysham Gibbon {{performed}} {{the first successful}} cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in which the blood was artificially circulated and oxygenated by using his invention, a pump known as the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine.</b> This new medical technology, which allowed the surgeon to operate on a dry and motionless heart by maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen content of the body, greatly increased surgical treatment options for heart defects and disease.|$|E
5000|$|It {{supports}} {{research into}} artificial internal organs and holds an annual meeting, which attracts industry, researchers and government officials. ASAIO's most heavily represented areas are nephrology, cardiopulmonary devices (artificial hearts, <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines)</b> and biomaterials. It publishes a peer-reviewed publication, the ASAIO Journal, {{six times a}} year.|$|R
50|$|The Sorin Group was {{a medical}} {{products}} {{group based in}} Italy, with significant operations in France, the United States, and Japan, specializing in cardiac devices. Its product lines include replacement heart valves, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cardiothoracic surgery accessories, data monitoring, <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> autotransfusion systems, and cannulae, and a line of blood management products.|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium chimaera, {{a member}} of the Mycobacterium avium complex, is a slow-growing, nontuberculous {{mycobacterium}} associated with outbreaks in cardiac-surgery patients supported on <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines.</b> We report a case of an elderly woman on chronic prednisone who presented with a six-month history of worsening chronic back pain, recurrent low-grade fevers, and weight loss. Imaging identified multilevel vertebral osteomyelitis and lumbar soft-tissue abscess. Abscess culture identified M. chimaera...|$|R
25|$|It {{deals with}} the {{anesthesia}} aspects of care related to surgical cases such as open heart surgery, lung surgery, and other operations of the human chest. These aspects include perioperative care with expert manipulation of patient cardiopulmonary physiology through precise and advanced application of pharmacology, resuscitative techniques, critical care medicine, and invasive procedures. This also includes management of the cardiopulmonary bypass (<b>heart-lung)</b> <b>machine,</b> which most cardiac procedures require intraoperatively while the heart undergoes surgical correction.|$|E
25|$|The last {{variable}} is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR {{and strength of}} contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient’s blood is normally diverted to an artificial <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The {{transplantation}} process starts {{after the}} donor lungs are inspected {{and the decision}} to transplant has been made. An incision is then made from under the patient's armpit, around to the sternum, and then back towards the other armpit; {{this is known as}} a clamshell incision. In the case of a sequential transplant the recipients lung with the poorest lung functions is collapsed, the blood vessels tied off, and cut at the corresponding bronchi. The new lung is then placed and the blood vessels reattached. To make sure the lung is satisfactory before transplanting the other a bronchoscopy is performed. When the surgeons are satisfied with the performance of the new lung, surgery on the second lung will proceed. In 10% to 20% of double-lung transplants the patient is hooked up to a <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> which pumps blood for the body and supplies fresh oxygen.|$|E
40|$|Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) {{running at}} a {{constant}} speed are routinely used for the mechanical support of the heart in various clinical applications, from short-term use in <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines</b> to long-term support of a failing heart. Their operating range is delineated by suction and regurgitation events, leaving limited control on the cardiac workload. This study investigates whether different ratios of systolic/diastolic support are advantageous over a constant-speed operation...|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{appropriate}} technology - medical technology {{should be provided}} that is accessible, affordable, feasible and culturally acceptable to the community. Examples {{of appropriate}} technology include refrigerators for vaccine cold storage. Less appropriate could include, in many settings, body scanners or <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> which benefit only a small minority concentrated in urban areas. They are generally not accessible to the poor, but draw {{a large share of}} resources.|$|R
50|$|Peristaltic {{pumps are}} {{typically}} used to pump clean/sterile or aggressive fluids without exposing those fluids to contamination from exposed pump components. Some common applications include pumping IV fluids through an infusion device, apheresis, aggressive chemicals, high solids slurries {{and other materials}} where isolation of the product from the environment, and the environment from the product, are critical. It is also used in <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines</b> to circulate blood during a bypass surgery as the pump does not cause significant hemolysis.|$|R
25|$|The {{heart was}} a major prize for {{transplant}} surgeons. But over and above rejection issues, the heart deteriorates within minutes of death, so any operation {{would have to be}} performed at great speed. The development of the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> was also needed. Lung pioneer James Hardy attempted a human heart transplant in 1964, but when a premature failure of comatose Boyd Rush's heart caught Hardy with no human donor, he used a chimpanzee heart, which beat in his patient's chest for approximately one hour and then failed. The first success was achieved on 3 December 1967, by Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa. Louis Washkansky, the recipient, survived for eighteen days amid what many saw as a distasteful publicity circus. The media interest prompted a spate of heart transplants. Over a hundred were performed in 1968–1969, but almost all the people died within 60 days. Barnard's second patient, Philip Blaiberg, lived for 19 months.|$|E
2500|$|Other 20th-century medical {{advances}} and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine,</b> [...] antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases {{have also been}} developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, ...|$|E
2500|$|Following a single-lung transplantation, the patient, {{identified}} {{later as}} convicted murderer John Richard Russell, survived for 18 days. From 1963 to 1978, multiple attempts at lung transplantation failed because of rejection and problems with anastomotic bronchial healing. It {{was only after}} {{the invention of the}} <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine,</b> coupled with the development of immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin, that organs such as the lungs could be transplanted with a reasonable chance of patient recovery.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Kolff {{left the}} Netherlands to seek {{opportunities}} in the US. At the Cleveland Clinic, {{he was involved in}} the development of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines</b> to maintain heart and pulmonary function during cardiac surgery. He also improved on his dialysis machine. At Brigham and Women's Hospital, with funding from New York real estate developer David Rose he developed the first production artificial kidney, the Kolff Brigham Artificial Kidney, manufactured by the Edward A. Olson Co. in Boston Massachusetts, and later the Travenol Twin-Coil Artificial Kidney.|$|R
50|$|By {{the middle}} {{part of the}} 20th century, medical {{research}} at the University of Iowa began making an impact. In 1939, Iowa researchers developed modern blood banking and UI hospitals became {{the first in the}} world to develop a successful method of freezing human sperm, leading to a live birth in 1952. Other innovations from this period include the first human EEG recordings, first description of how blood is supplied to the prostate gland, the Ponseti Method of surgical treatment of clubfoot, and one of the world's first <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} for precise and descriptive cardiac anatomy has become most imperative {{in view of}} advances in heart surgery. Until recently, emphasis has been directed toward the study of intra-cardiac anatomy only by select theoretical anatomists with no direct practical application to functional medicine; however, {{with the advent of}} the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> improved techniques for extra-corporeal circulation and hypothermia, more and more cardiac surgical techniques are being developed and perfected. The potentialities for an increased number of intra-cardiac surgical procedures naturally follows the perfection of the mechanical devises making such surgery possible...|$|R
2500|$|Alternate {{methods of}} {{minimally}} invasive {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery have been developed. [...] Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is a technique of performing bypass surgery {{without the use of}} cardiopulmonary bypass (the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine).</b> Avoidance of aortic manipulation may be achieved through the [...] "anaortic" [...] or no-touch OPCAB technique, which has been shown to reduce stroke and mortality compared to on-pump CABG. [...] Further refinements to OPCAB have resulted in minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB), a technique of performing bypass surgery through a 5 to 10cm incision.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Lindbergh's {{sister-in-law}} {{developed a}} fatal heart condition. Lindbergh {{began to wonder}} why hearts could not be repaired with surgery. Starting in early 1931 at the Rockefeller Institute and continuing during his time living in France, Lindbergh studied the perfusion of organs outside the body with Nobel Prize-winning French surgeon Dr. Alexis Carrel. Although perfused organs {{were said to have}} survived surprisingly well, all showed progressive degenerative changes within a few days. Lindbergh's invention, a glass perfusion pump, named the [...] "Model T" [...] pump, is credited with making future heart surgeries possible. In this early stage, the pump was far from perfected. In 1938, Lindbergh and Carrel described an artificial heart in the book in which they summarized their work, The Culture of Organs, but it was decades before one was built. In later years, Lindbergh's pump was further developed by others, eventually leading to the construction of the first <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Cox maze {{procedure}} is an open-heart surgical procedure intended to eliminate AF and was first performed at St. Louis' Barnes Hospital—now Barnes-Jewish Hospital—in 1987. [...] "Maze" [...] {{refers to the}} series of incisions made in the atria, which are arranged in a maze-like pattern. The intention was to eliminate AF by using incisional scars to block abnormal electrical circuits (atrial macroreentry) that AF requires. This procedure required an extensive series of endocardial (from {{the inside of the}} heart) incisions through both atria, a median sternotomy (vertical incision through the breastbone) and cardiopulmonary bypass (<b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine).</b> A series of improvements were made, culminating in 1992 in the Cox maze III procedure, which is now considered to be the [...] "gold standard" [...] for effective surgical cure of AF. The Cox maze III is sometimes referred to as the [...] "traditional maze", the [...] "cut and sew maze", or simply the [...] "maze".|$|E
5000|$|Between 1949 and 1974, {{staff at}} the Baker Medical Research Institute also devoted a {{significant}} amount of time and energy to equipment construction {{to meet the needs of}} their researchers, this included some early, crude versions of <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines</b> to aid in cardiac surgery. Some research on the alimentary canal also was undertaken, however this work ceased in 1968. In 1949, cardiovascular research was one of the major growth edges of medicine was cardiology. At the time, it represented two thirds of the total research in the Baker Medical Research Institute. Cardiology research included: ...|$|R
40|$|Several new {{techniques}} are reported for studying cardiovascular circulation in small laboratory animals kept in metabolic chambers. Chronical cannulation, miniaturized membrane type <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> a prototype walking chamber, and a fluorocarbon immersion method to simulate weightlessness are outlined. Differential hypothermia work on rat cancers provides localized embedding of radionuclides and other chemotherapeutical agents in tumors and increases {{at the same}} time blood circulation through the warmed tumor as compared {{to the rest of the}} cold body. Some successful clinical applications of combined chemotherapy and differential hypothermia in skin cancer, mammary tumors, and brain gliomas are described...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the optical {{parameters}} absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient and phase function {{of blood and}} its components were investigated, which are useful for optical methods in both diagnostics and therapy. They serve to calculate the dose of light-tissue interaction and permit new optical measuring methods and devices to be developed. So, {{it was possible to}} develop new non-invasive blood monitoring procedures of high clinical relevance, including procedures for online determination of hematocrit and oxygen saturation at <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines,</b> a sensor for quality assurance of blood products and selective measurement of the capillary blood flow in the skin by means of laser Doppler spectroscopy...|$|R
2500|$|Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922– 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac {{surgeon who}} {{performed}} the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on 3 December 1967, {{and the second}} overall heart transplant (James Hardy did a xenotransplant in 1964). [...] Growing up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country. [...] As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia. [...] His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States. [...] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Wangensteen. [...] Vince Gott {{introduced him to the}} <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine,</b> and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1955, Barnard {{travelled}} to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, {{to begin}} a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new. [...] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. [...] Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, [...] "It {{was the type of}} inspired thinking that entranced Barnard"). [...] In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> for an operation. [...] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's 's service. [...] It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway. [...] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. [...] (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) [...] Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast. [...] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled [...] "The aortic valve – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve". The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled [...] "The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia". Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as [...] "the most fascinating time in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Surgery is {{curative}} of {{mitral valve}} regurgitation. [...] There are two surgical {{options for the}} treatment of MI: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke. [...] There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: [...] Resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the 'Carpentier' approach), and installation of artificial chordae to [...] "anchor" [...] the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the 'David' approach). [...] With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. [...] In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve. [...] With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support. [...] In some cases, the [...] "double orifice" [...] (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill [...] the left ventricle with blood before it pumps. [...] In general, mitral valve surgery [...] requires [...] "open-heart" [...] surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machine</b> (cardiopulmonary bypass). [...] This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.|$|E
40|$|Silicone fluids {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in certain <b>heart-lung</b> <b>machines</b> {{in order to}} remove bubbles produced by the mechanical oxygenation of the blood. The antifoaming technique involves the passing of oxygenated blood over a filmed surface or through a mesh or sponge treated with antifoam material. This is done to prevent air emboli which might occur if bubbles were allowed to enter the circulation. The method of oxygenation used in the unit in which this work was done is the DeWall type of bubble oxygenator.
