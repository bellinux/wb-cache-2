From the 3D design, {{two-dimensional}} flat sections are created {{to become the}} precision-cut frames (internal Rib-like structures perpendicular to the mid-line from nose to tail) and keel (known as stringer in a foam surfboard). Then bookmatched wood is selected that blends {{together to form a}} unique pattern on the deck and bottom of the board. The keel and frames are then drilled with holes to further reduce the weight. The constructed frames and keel define the overall shape and size of the board. The installation of fins and fin-boxes (for removable fins) is aided by a builder's laser to ensure that fins are placed, canted and toed-in symmetrically. The hollow and watertight nature of these boards require the installation of a <b>vent</b> <b>plug</b> to equalize internal and external pressure that changes due to temperature variation and to changes in atmospheric pressure which, without the vent, would cause air pressure inside the board to increase.|$|R

Injection molding part {{which is used}} in battery for the venting purpose is modeled and analyzed to determine the parting surface, gating systems. Injection molding parts conduct mold flow analysis to determine the feasibility, and the die gating system and the injection molding process are optimized. Thus, high projection quality products are obtained. To permeate this, the use of Computer aided design (CAD) and Computer aided engineering (CAE) application assisted in design and establish the most optimal parting surface and gating system. This research was conducted by implementing the use of CAD/CAE tools to produce an optimal mold design using Pro/E and Moldflow ® applications.

40|$|At mature andesitic volcanoes, magma {{can reach}} the surface through the same path for several eruptions thus forming a {{volcanic}} conduit. Because of degassing, cooling, and crystallization, magma viscosity increase in {{the upper part of}} the conduit may induce the formation of a viscous plug. We conducted numerical simulations to quantify the deformation field caused by this plug emplacement and evolution. Stress continuity between Newtonian magma flow and elastic crust is considered. Plug emplacement causes a ground inflation correlated to a decrease of the magma discharge rate. A parametric study shows that surface displacements depend on three dimensionless numbers: the conduit aspect ratio (radius/length), the length ratio between the plug and the conduit, and the viscosity contrast between the plug and the magma column. Larger displacements are obtained for high-viscosity plugs emplaced in large aspect ratio conduits. We find that only tiltmeters or GPS located close to the vent (a few hundred meters) might record the plug emplacement. At immediate proximity of the <b>vent,</b> <b>plug</b> emplacement might even dominate the deformation signal over dome growth or magma reservoir pressurization effects. For given plug thicknesses and viscosity profiles, our model explains well the amplitude of tilt variations (from 1 to 25 mu rad) measured at Montserrat and Mt. St. Helens. We also demonstrate that at Montserrat, even if most of the tilt signal is due to shear stress induced by magma flow, pressurization beneath the plug accounts for 20 % of the signal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of stress-concentrating flaws such as microfractures, {{vesicular}} glassy materials can withstand gas pressures within vesicles in excess of 100 MPa; however, vesicles within such materials are known to decrepitate explosively at much lower internal gas pressures, both in natural systems and in the laboratory. Here we present a model that quantitatively predicts the generation of microfractures in vesicle walls during cooling. Cooling of gas-bearing vesicles in glassy rock has little effect on water solubility in the glass, but leads to a rapid decrease in gas pressure in the vesicles. The drop in pressure causes disequilibrium between {{the water in the}} glass and in the vesicle. Dehydration of the glass in a diffusive boundary layer around the vesicle leads to elastic shrinkage. The resulting strain generates large tensile tangential stresses which can exceed the strength of the glass, causing microfracturing. Such microfractures present a possible means by which glassy rock surrounding vesicles could be weakened enough to permit explosive decrepitation at low pore vapor pressures. The results have implications wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed. For example rocks formed in shallow subvolcanic intrusions or <b>vent</b> <b>plugs</b> may spontaneously disintegrate with explosive emission of vapor; glassy submarine lavas spontaneously decrepitate upon dredging from the ocean floor (''popping rock''); vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating vapor-melt phase equilibria have been observed to contain abundant fractures surrounding vesicles and to dehydrate at anomalously high rates...|$|R

50|$|The {{cargo door}} design flaw, and the {{consequences}} of a resulting in-flight decompression, had been noted by Convair engineer Dan Applegate in a 1972 memo. The memo was written after American Airlines Flight 96, another DC-10 experienced a rear cargo door failure identical to the one that occurred on Flight 981, also causing an explosive decompression. Fortunately, even though the pilot's ability to control Flight 96 was compromised by some severed underfloor cables in the blown-out section of the plane, they were able to land in Detroit without further injuries. The NTSB's investigation into Flight 96 determined that baggage handlers forced the locking handle closed, and the latches did not engaged fully because of an electrical problem. The incident investigators discovered that the rod connecting the pins to the handle was weak enough that it could be bent with repeated operation and force, allowing the baggage handler to close the handle with his knee even when the pins interfered with the torque tube flanges. The <b>vent</b> <b>plug</b> and cockpit light were operated by the handle or the locking pins, not the latches, so when the handle was stowed, both of these warning devices indicated that the door was properly closed. In the case of Flight 96, the plane was able to make a safe emergency landing because not all of the underfloor cables were severed, thus allowing the pilots limited control. This greatly contrasted with Flight 981, where all of the underfloor cables were severed in the decompression and the pilots lost complete control of the plane.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{also played}} a role in the formation of the range. Eruptions of lava formed volcanic cones whose <b>vents</b> were eventually <b>plugged</b> with hardening magma. These hardened cores are called volcanic plugs. In the case of the Mandara Mountains, the plugs were much more erosion-resistant than the exterior of the cones, which wore away over time. Eventually, only the plugs remained, forming the stark, needle-like spires such as Kapsiki Peak that the range is known for.|$|R

Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small <b>plugged</b> <b>vents.</b> However, as the remaining mountain is roughly symmetrical, most of the activity must have occurred at the central plug.|$|R
40|$|Several {{thousand}} 55 -gallon drums of residue {{material from}} past plutonium processing operations are being stored at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). This stored material awaits stabilization, packaging for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for disposal, or packaging for shipment to other DOE sites for processing. Each of these drums is {{fitted with a}} vent filter to prevent accumulation of hydrogen or other flammable gases. A filter-monitoring program was developed to assure that these vent filters continue to function properly. Nuclear Filter Technology Model 012 and 013 filters {{are being used to}} vent the drums. A simple filter test device has been developed at RFETS for monitoring these vent filters. This test device consists of a cup that sits over the filter and seals to the drum lid, a pressure gauge, a flow meter, and a hand pump. If the flow rate through the filter at 1 -inch water column is less than 35 ml/min, the filter is considered plugged, and the filter is changed.

The summit rocks of Rubers Law were formed within a volcanic vent. There is a small area of volcanic agglomerate, formed in the vent by an explosive eruption of magma from the volcano. The rest of the summit rocks are microgabbro (previously known as dolerite), the remains of a volcanic plug formed from magma which solidified within the <b>vent.</b> Another microgabbro <b>plug</b> is located among the trees of Denholmhill Wood, 2 km north of the summit.|$|R

In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the <b>vent,</b> possibly <b>plugging</b> the <b>vent</b> (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|R

40|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{characterized}} by low-energy explosive activity, which may repeat, at fairly regular intervals, {{for long periods of}} time. Explosions at the vent are thought to result from the arrival of discrete slugs of magmatic gas that have risen through the magmatic plumbing system. We develop a one dimensional, analytical model of gas slug rise in a volcanic conduit which we use to investigate the controls on the dynamics of Strombolian eruptions. We consider a partially-filled, cylindrical conduit containing degassed magma, that is initially in magma-static equilibrium with a constant pressure magma reservoir at depth. We introduce a slug of gas {{at the base of the}} conduit and consider the temporal evolution of the pressure distribution in the conduit, and the motion of the magma above and below the slug, as the slug rises, decompresses, and expands isothermally. We validate our model against published data for gas slugs rising and decompressing in a vertical pipe [James et al., 2008, Geological Society of London, Special Publications 307, 147 - 167] by imposing the condition of zero magma-flux at the base of the conduit, and constant pressure at the top; we find excellent agreement. If we impose the more geologically-sound condition of constant pressure at the base of the conduit, we can consider two scenarios of volcanological relevance: 1) <b>Vent</b> <b>plugged</b> with cooler, more-viscous magma. In this case, as the slug rises and expands beneath the plug, it pushes the degassed magma below it down the conduit, consequently, magma re-enters the chamber from the base of the conduit. The slug reaches the viscous plug at the top of the conduit with a significant over-pressure; this may be sufficient to disrupt the plug, causing a Strombolian explosion, or the gas may percolate away. Fresh magma then moves up from the chamber, into the conduit to restore magma-static equilibrium. 2) Open vent. As the slug rises and expands, the volume of magma held in the falling-film that encircles the slug increases. Since this film is supported viscously by the conduit walls, it does not contribute to the magma-static pressure at the base of the conduit which, therefore, decreases, causing fresh magma to flow upwards. Fresh magma entering the base of the conduit may cause a new slug to form, either through decompression and exsolution, or by tapping a gas-rich layer at an asperity, or at the chamber roof. In either case, scenario 1 (<b>plugged</b> <b>vent)</b> will lead to periodic, Strombolian eruption, whilst scenario 2 (open vent) will lead to sustained eruption at higher discharge rate. A noteworthy feature of the model is that the conduit is recharged with fresh magma following slug rise, even if no magma is erupted at the surface. We apply our model to the case of Stromboli, and compare model output with monitoring observations. We find that the most important parameters controlling eruption style and vigour are magma viscosity, mass of gas in the slug, and the ratio of slug radius to conduit radius. Our findings potentially impact the dangerous transition from ‘touristic’ Strombolian activity to more-hazardous paroxysmal activity...|$|R
40|$|Muon {{radiography}} {{was first}} {{applied to the}} pyramid Giza in 1968 while volcanology has long history since the 0079 eruption of Vesuvius. Some traditional conception of volcanology for many centuries sometimes disturbed its progress. It has been difficult for volcanologists to correctly explore subsurface structure of volcanoes by conventional means {{even though some of}} them were formed under their eyes. Volcanologists would complain that they could not see through the earth beneath their feet. Very recently muon radiography gives us a clue for visualization of the interior of volcanoes though its detection ranges are limited at present. In 2007, Tanaka et al.

5000|$|The most {{significant}} volcanic event in historical times was the simultaneous eruption of Mount Katmai and Novarupta in June 1912. Novarupta's eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that covered a nearby valley with ash {{as much as}} 300 ft thick. At {{the same time the}} summit of Katmai collapsed into a caldera. As the valley deposits cooled, they emitted steam from fissures and fumaroles, earning the name [...] "Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes." [...] As heat has dissipated from the deposits the steam vents have subsided and the valley has been eroded. At present streams have cut canyons as much as 100 ft deep, but only 5 to 10 ft wide. Katmai is a stratovolcano, 6716 ft in height, with a large summit caldera. Several glaciers originate from the mountain, and one in the caldera is the only glacier known to have formed in historical times. The caldera floor is about 250 m below the rim. The mountain stands on Jurassic sedimentary rocks, and its volcanic components are less than 1500 ft thick. Apart from the 1912 eruption, no significant activity has occurred in historical times. Novarupta is described as a Plinian pyroclastic <b>vent</b> with a <b>plug</b> dome, a 2000 m diameter crater with a 65 m, 400 m diameter dome in the middle.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} atmosphere of incubation in the detection of clinically important bacteremia and fungemia in adults, we compared the yield of microorganisms from 10, 541 paired 5 -ml samples of blood incubated aerobically and anaerobically. The medium, supplemented peptone broth (SPB) with 0. 03 % sodium polyanetholesulfonate, and the ratio of blood to broth (1 : 10) were {{the same for all}} cultures. Only cultures with adequate blood samples (greater than or equal to 80 % of stated volume) were compared statistically. More fungi (P less than 10 (- 7)) grew in continuously vented bottles of SPB. Aerobic incubation also favored (P less than 0. 01) isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Eubacterium; more than 80 % of these bacterial organisms were detected only in vented bottles. Anaerobic incubation (<b>plugged</b> <b>venting</b> units) did not significantly favor the isolation of any genus of microorganisms, although an estimated 11 % more Bacteroidaceae grew in the unvented bottle of SPB. By comparison of our data with published results for other media, we conclude that the need for both aerobic and anaerobic incubation of blood cultures is dependent upon the medium used and the microorganisms likely to be encountered. Vented incubation of blood cultured in SPB is crucial for detection of fungi and some bacteria. Routine use of an unvented bottle of SPB may not be worthwhile for patients in whom Bacteroidaceae cause bacteremia infrequently. However, when Bacteroidaceae are suspected as the cause of sepsis, use of an unvented bottle of SPB is prudent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how {{explosive}} behavior and geophysical signals in a volcanic conduit {{are related to the}} development of overpressure in slug-driven eruptions. A first suite of laboratory experiments of gas slugs ascending in analogue conduits was performed. Slugs ascended into a range of analogue liquids and conduit diameters to allow proper scaling to the natural volcanoes. The geometrical variation of the slug in response to the explored variables was parameterised. Volume of gas slug and rheology of the liquid phase revealed the key parameters in controlling slug overpressure at bursting. Founded on these results, a theoretical model to calculate burst overpressure for slug-driven eruptions was developed. The dimensionless approach adopted allowed to apply the model to predict bursting pressure of slugs at Stromboli. Comparison of predicted values with measured data from Stromboli volcano showed that the model can explain the entire spectrum of observed eruptive styles at Stromboli – from low-energy puffing, through normal Strombolian eruptions, up to paroxysmal explosions – as manifestations of a single underlying physical process. Finally, another suite of laboratory experiments was performed to observe oscillatory pressure and forces variations generated during the expansion and bursting of gas slugs ascending in a conduit. Two end-member boundary conditions were imposed {{at the base of the}} pipe, simulating slug ascent in closed base (zero magma flux) and open base (constant flux) conduit. At the top of the pipe, a range of boundary conditions that are relevant at a volcanic vent were imposed, going from open to <b>plugged</b> <b>vent.</b> The results obtained illustrate that a change in boundary conditions in the conduit concur to affect the dynamic of slug expansion and burst: an upward flux at the base of the conduit attenuates the magnitude of the pressure transients, while a rheological stiffening in the top-most region of conduit changes dramatically the magnitude of the observed pressure transients, favoring a sudden, and more energetic pressure release into the overlying atmosphere. Finally, a discussion on the implication of changing boundary on the oscillatory processes generated at the volcanic scale is also given. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction of}} 3 D bedrock geological models of the Mississippian (Visean) Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation (CPV), a succession of basaltic to trachytic lavas in the Midland Valley of Scotland using GSI 3 D version 2011 Bedrock. These lavas form a range of picturesque hills around {{the margin of the}} River Clyde catchment to the north, west and south of Glasgow. The modelling has formed part of the BGS Geology and Landscape Scotland’s 3 D modelling programme of the Clyde catchment, and is a contribution to the Clyde-Urban Super-Project (CUSP). The horseshoe-shaped outcrop of the CPV was divided into 4 areas for modelling. To the north of Glasgow the Campsie Fells block comprises an area of c. 285 km 2 and the model consists of 23 geological units, 73 faults and 64 cross-sections. To the west of this the Kilpatrick Hills block model of an area of 145 km 2 has 9 geological units, 45 faults and 34 cross-sections. West of Glasgow is the Renfrewshire Hills block, an area of 650 km 2, with 18 geological units, 87 faults and 90 cross-sections. South of Glasgow is the Southern Hills block, some 530 km 2 There are few boreholes in the area and the models have been constructed mostly using outcrop data and published cross-sections {{as a starting point for}} constructing the fence-diagram. Also, a methodology was devised and tested successfully for the modelling of funnel-shaped intrusions which is appropriate for the multitude of small <b>plugs,</b> <b>vents</b> and necks that cut the sequence in the Midland Valley. Despite shortcomings in the quality of the calculated surfaces, the modelling has shown that GSI 3 D can cope with many aspects of complex Carboniferous geology as found in the Midland Valley of Scotland. However, as many of the stratigraphical surfaces in these models are marred by calculation errors, the models must not be regarded as finished products, which await improvements to the GSI 3 D engine, currently in progress., with 8 geological units, 64 faults and 45 cross-sections. The scale for each of the models is nominally 1 : 50 000. Though the focus of the modelling was on selected divisions of the CPV, enveloping formations were also included. Most importantly here is the 3 -fold division of the Inverclyde Group beneath the volcanic succession, and the overlying units within the Strathclyde, Clackmannan and Scottish Coal Measures groups, as appropriate. The models show the following significant geological features: The overstepping relationship of the base of the volcanic succession on the underlying Clyde Sandstone, Ballagan and Kinnesswood formations; A transpressional ‘pop-up’ duplex structure developed within a restraining bend on the dextral strike-slip Campsie West Fault, provides a mechanism for formation of the unconformity at the base of the volcanic succession; The localised distribution of lava and pyroclastic units and their spatial relationship with the linear vent-swarms...|$|R
40|$|Reconnaissance soil {{sampling}} within the catchment of streams containing anomalous levels of copper in drainage samples {{led to the}} discovery of disseminated copper mineralisation in the Black Stockarton Moor area of Galloway, Scotland. Analysis of aeromagnetic data and of a gravity survey of the area, previously mapped as an irregular complex of dykes, suggested that the region was underlain by laminar bodies of granodiorite. Geological mapping r evealed the presence of a major Caledonian multiphase subvolcanic complex intruding LOvler Palaeozoic turbidi tes, {{to the west of the}} Criffe! granodioritic plutonic complex. An induced polarisation survey delineated an arcuate anomaly about 6 km long and the resul t s of a simultaneous geochemical soil survey showed a zone with anomalous levels of copper (> 140 ppm to 5500 ppm) in the southern part of the area to be essentially paralle l to the IP anomaly but partially displaced to the east. A series of three deep angled drill holes and nine shallow holes sited on geochemical and geophysical anomalies confirmed the widespread presence of both veinlet and disseminated pyrite and copper mineralisation of the porphyry type. The Black Stockarton Moor subvolcanic complex is a composite of minor intrusive rocks, the ear l iest phase of which, comprising porphyri te dyke swarms, granodiorite sheet intrusions, small granodiori te stocks, breccia pipes, <b>vent</b> agglomerates with <b>plugs</b> of basic rock and a few basic dykes, predates the adjacent multiphase Crlffel plutonic complex. The second phase of subvo lcanic activity postdates the plutonic rocks and comprises intense en-echelon s igmoidal swarms of porphyrite dykes sharply discordant to the earliest phase rocks. A minor third phase consists of linear porphyrite dykes closely associated with fault - ing. Chemical analysis and mineralogical examination of the borehole material indicates that regular zonation can be observed in the style and intensity of both mineralisation and hydrothermal alteration. This zonation is regular fr om west to east across the IP and soil anomalies. A propylitic alteration zone with the development of chlorite. epidote and minor sericite in igneous rocks and of calcite, quartz, jasperoid, chlorite, amphibole, epidote and albite in sedimentary rocks occurs to the wes t. Within this zone hematite gradually gives way to increasing amounts of pyrite from west t o east. The propylitic zone passes into a sericitic alteration zone where sedimentary rocks are frequently bleached and igneous rocks pink or orange-coloured containing secondary quartz, chlorite and muscovite. Pyrite is most conspicuous within rocks of the outer sericite zone, the outcrop of which coincides roughly with the axis of the IP anomaly. Further east pyrite decreases but chalcopyrite and bornite with some chalcocite become relatively conspicuous and copper levels are the highest attained (in the 400 ppm to 1100 ppm range). save for isolated highly br·ecciated sections.
