A logistic random utility model (RUM) of fisher location choice by beam trawlers {{in the southwest}} of England was used to help answer this question. The RUM was parameterised {{using data from the}} <b>EU</b> <b>vessel</b> monitoring system, the UK logbook Fishing Activity database and the UK Fishing Vessel Register from 2005 to 2008. Individual vessel location choices and model variables were aggregated to ICES statistical rectangles (approximately 30 nautical miles square) by month. The model outputs show that vessels in southwest England made location choices (in 2005 - 2007) based on recent economic returns (value of catch per hour fished) in the month prior and in the previous year in the same month. Vessel skippers also made decisions based on the economic returns of the entire fleet; and tended to choose locations that yielded higher economic returns to the fleet compared to other available locations. This suggests a transfer of knowledge on what others in the fleet are catching and where. Beam trawlers also appeared to be risk-averse, preferring to fish locations closer to their homeport, and at locations with less variance in the value of catch per unit effort at a location, even if the economic returns could be high elsewhere. Vessels also preferred to fish in deeper water, particularly the larger vessels of the fleet. To evaluate the models predictive ability, we compared 2008 location choices with predicted choices using the 2005 - 2007 model coefficients. The model correctly predicted vessels not fishing in a rectangle in 97...|$|E

50|$|Up to 2006, all EU {{funds to}} Greenland (then €42.8 {{million per year}}) went via the EU-Greenland fishing agreement. Between 2007 and 2013, the EU {{provided}} €25 million per year outside of fishing. It has been given aid since it {{pulled out of the}} EU (see below) in 1985 to roughly the same amount it was previously receiving in EU structural funds (which it lost the right to receive due to its secession). This amounted to about 7% of Greenland's budget. The amount paid via the fishing agreement was in return for <b>EU</b> <b>vessels</b> fishing in Greenland's waters and to help restructure Greenland's fishing fleet. However, this deal was struck down by the European Court of Auditors, who felt the amount the EU was paying was too high for the quantity of fish caught.|$|R
40|$|This project {{performs}} {{a case study}} of the Mauritanian-EU FPA 2006 - 2012 in order to examine how Wallerstein’s world-system analysis can explain the relation between the EU and Mauritania. The project first outlines EEZs and UNCLOS and how these shape the contemporary fishery agreements. Afterwards, the Mauritanian-EU FPA 2006 - 2012 is outlined. There is a paradox within the agreement as the FPA aims to help Mauritania develop economically and protect the environment, yet, the opposite seems to occur. The project follows this by exploring the state of the Mauritanian economy and elaborate on the consequences of the FPA on the Mauritanian fishing sector. The Mauritanian economy is developing overall but the fishing sector is found to suffer from debt, insufficient maritime infrastructure and a lack of investment. The environmental consequences, including overfishing and environmentally damaging fishing methods by <b>EU</b> <b>vessels,</b> are then expanded upon. All of aforementioned conclusions are used to analyse the case using concepts and ideas from the world-system analysis. The EU appears to be plundering Mauritania, externalising the costs of production and the case fits into Wallerstein’s idea of the world-system in the state of crisis. The project concludes that the world-system analysis is able to explain why the EU fish in Mauritania despite economic and environmental consequences for Mauritania...|$|R

40|$|Skates (Rajidae) {{have been}} commercially {{exploited}} in Europe {{for hundreds of}} years with some species’ abundances declining dramatically during the twentieth century. In 2009 it became “prohibited for <b>EU</b> <b>vessels</b> to target, retain, tranship or land” certain species in some ICES areas, including the critically endangered common skate and the endangered white skate. To examine compliance with skate bans the official UK landings data for 2011 – 2014 were analysed. Surprisingly, it was found that after the ban prohibited species were still reported landed in UK ports, including 9. 6 t of common skate during 2011 – 2014. The majority of reported landings of common and white skate were from northern UK waters and landed into northern UK ports. Although past landings could not be validated as being actual prohibited species, the landings’ patterns found reflect known abundance distributions that suggest actual landings were made, rather than sporadic occurrence across ports that would be evident if landings were solely due to systematic misidentification or data entry errors. Nevertheless, misreporting and data entry errors could not be discounted as factors contributing to the recorded landings of prohibited species. These findings raise questions about the efficacy of current systems to police skate landings to ensure prohibited species remain protected. By identifying UK ports with the highest apparent landings of prohibited species and those still landing species grouped as'skates and rays’, these results may aid authorities in allocating limited resources more effectively to reduce landings, misreporting and data errors of prohibited species, and increase species-specific landing compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} and migrations of Norwegian spring spawning herring in the Norwegian Sea {{in the spring}} and summer of 1997 were mapped during 11 coordinated surveys carried out by Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian, Russian and <b>EU</b> research <b>vessels.</b> After spawning on the banks off the Norwegian coast in February-March, the spent herring migrated out into the Norwegian Sea, and were recorded in international waters in April. In May, the younger part of the spawning stock was distributed in small schools or scattered layers at 25 - 100 m depth over wide areas in the central Norwegian Sea. Older and larger herring formed large schools, generally at 250 - 400 m depth, near the cold front along the eastern border of the Icelandic EEZ (exclusive economic zone). The total abundance of herring in the Norwegian Sea was estimated to be about 45 billion individuals or about 9 million tonnes in May...|$|R

40|$|World food {{production}} has increased substantially {{in the past}} century, thanks mostly {{to the increase in}} the use of oil as input in the production processes. This growing use of fossil fuels has negative effects, both on the environment and the production costs. Fishing is a fuel consuming {{food production}} activity, and its energy efficiency performance has worsened over time. World-wide fisheries are also suffering from overexploitation, which contributes to the poor efficiency performance, adding more pressure and criticism on this economic activity. In this paper we analyzed the energy efficiency performance of more than 20, 000 European Union (<b>EU)</b> fishing <b>vessels</b> for the period 2002 - 2008, using the edible energy return on investment (EROI) indicator. The vessels analyzed, grouped in 49 different fleets, represented 25 % of the vessels and 33 % of the landings of the EU fishing sector. These EU fishing fleets' average EROI for 2008 was 0. 11, which translates to an energy content of the fuel burned that is 9 times greater than the edible energy content of the catch. Hence, the significance of this study arises from the use of time-series data on a relevant part of the EU fleet that showed stable or even slight improvements on the EROI over time. Moreover, results showed that the energy efficiency of the different fleets varied significantly (from 0. 02 to 1. 12), mainly depending on the fishing gear and the vessel length. The performance of the most efficient fleets, such as large pelagic trawlers and seiners, was comparable to many agricultural production activities. The plausible drivers behind these trends are further considered...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{indicators}} of fishing pressure in space {{are an important}} part of the Data Collection Framework (DCF) established by the European Commission in its attempt to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries. These indicators are devised to use the information provided by the Vessel Monitoring System, a mandatory tool for <b>EU</b> fishing <b>vessels</b> which allows to record fishing activity in space and time. This study reports and analyzes trends of DCF fishing pressure indicators in the years 2007 [...] 2010 for the Italian trawlers in seven Mediterranean geographic sub-areas and the related trends of landing per unit effort. In addition, new versions of these indicators are developed and their performances compared to the DCF ones by a simulation approach. The rationale for these new version of indicators is based on: (i) the development of a formal definition of ``fishing ground'', allowing for innovative statistical analyses of fishing patterns in space and time; (ii) the revision of issues affecting DCF indicators. Results provide: (i) the first extensive documentation of space use by fisheries through time; (ii) evidences of subtle yet significant changes in fishing pattern which, in agreement to other studies, indirectly support a decline of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean; (iii) improved versions of DCF fishing pressure indicators, obtained via the identification and analysis of fishing grounds and the assessment of aggregation by Gini's G index. The latter point could mark an important progress in order to overcome some critical weakness evidenced by DCF indicators. Moreover, the statistical identification and analysis of fishing grounds could represent a valuable insight in quantitative investigations of fisheries impacts and effects, even beyond indicators computation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the approach {{taken by the}} European Union to the management of deep-sea fish stocks. An extensive range of measures was adopted in 2002, and implementation began in 2003. The scheme, which is binding on <b>EU</b> fishing <b>vessels</b> targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantic, encompasses both input and output controls. In southern Europe and in the Mediterranean, deep-sea fisheries tend to be artisanal in nature, {{and in some cases}} of considerable antiquity. In northern community waters deepwater fisheries began in the 1970 ’s. These diverse fisheries, in several regions create particular problems for fisheries managers. The approach taken by the European Union was to adopt catch restrictions, in the form of total allowable catches for a range of the key deepwater species in the ICES area. In addition, a capacity restriction has been imposed. This requires that vessels that want to land more than a very small amount of some specified deepwater species should hold a license issued by its flag state. The overall capacity (in kilowatts and in gross tonnes) of vessels that can receive licences is limited to recent levels. The capacity limitation scheme is accompanied by a requirement to implement a scientific observer scheme in order to improve the scientific data available for assessment purposes.
