500|$|An album {{including}} all 14 {{songs in the}} episode, with Christophe Beck's scores for three other Buffy episodes, was released by Rounder Records in September 2002 as season seven premiered. John Virant, {{president and chief executive}} of Rounder Records, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I remember watching the episode when it aired last October, and after it was over, I said to my wife, 'That's the best hour of TV I've ever seen. Someone should put that [...] out.' <b>I</b> <b>inquired</b> at Fox, just following up, and they said, 'Well, we tried, it didn't happen. If you want to take a run at it, feel free. AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is [...] "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head. Reviewer Melinda Hill states it is [...] "a must-have for Buffy fans, but it wouldn't be out of place in anyone's collection".Musical Episode Soundtrack]], Allmusic.com.

"…if {{by chance}} {{anyone who had}} been in {{attendance}} on the elders should come my way, <b>I</b> <b>inquired</b> about the words of the elders – that is, what according to the elders Andrew or Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying." ...|$|E

He also informed me that he had brought me a present from General Jones, of Cheyenne. 'What kind of a present' <b>I</b> <b>inquired,</b> seeing no indication of any package about Jack. 'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped my hand over his mouth. News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a raid... I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Herodotus {{regarded}} the Colchians as an Ancient Egyptian race. Herodotus {{states that the}} Colchians, with the Ancient Egyptians and the Ethiopians, {{were the first to}} practice circumcision, a custom which he claims (without historical proof) that the Colchians inherited from remnants of the army of Pharaoh Sesostris. Herodotus writes, [...] "For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others. When it occurred to me, <b>I</b> <b>inquired</b> of both peoples; and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians; [...] the Egyptians said that they considered the Colchians part of Sesostris' army. I myself guessed it, partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision." [...] Apollonius of Rhodes states that the Egyptians of Colchis preserved as heirlooms a number of wooden tablets, which show, with considerable accuracy, seas and highways.|$|E
2500|$|The German missionaries Johannes Rebmann of Mombasa and Krapf {{were the}} first Europeans {{to try to reach}} the snowy mountain. According to English {{geographer}} Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro. Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and has quoted Rebmann's diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, [...] "This morning, at 10 o'clock, we obtained a clearer view of the mountains of Jagga, the summit of one of which was covered by what looked like a beautiful white cloud. When <b>I</b> <b>inquired</b> as to the dazzling whiteness, the guide merely called it 'cold' and at once I knew it could be neither more nor less than snow.... Immediately I understood how to interpret the marvelous tales Dr. Krapf and I had heard at the coast, of a vast mountain of gold and silver in the far interior, the approach to which was guarded by evil spirits." [...] In light of these sources, J. Shearson Hyland's assertion that Rebmann first saw the mountain in 1840 appears to be erroneous.|$|E
