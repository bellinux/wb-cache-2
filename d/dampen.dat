40|$|System {{nervousness}} {{in material}} requirements planning (MRP) systems has been receiving considerable attention recently. Several strategies are suggested to reduce MRP system nervousness. This paper examines {{one of these}} nervousness-reduction methods, <b>dampening</b> procedures. <b>Dampening</b> procedures are non-inventory-oriented, which screen out insignificant rescheduling messages generated by MRP systems so as to reduce schedule disruptions. The cost of rescheduling is incorporated {{as a component of}} total cost {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} alternative <b>dampening</b> procedures by a simulation experiment under such operating environments as the presence of production uncertainty, different capacity utilization, and different rescheduling efforts. The <b>dampening</b> procedures tested are the static <b>dampening</b> procedure, automatic rescheduling procedure, and cost-based <b>dampening</b> procedure. The results indicate that the static and cost-based <b>dampening</b> procedures outperform the automatic rescheduling procedure under most operating conditions considered in the study. Furthermore, the relative performance of the static and cost-based procedures depends on the difficulty of rescheduling efforts involved and the lot-sizing rule used. material requirements planning production scheduling <b>dampening</b> procedure...|$|R

5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves <b>dampen</b> out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to <b>dampen</b> excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
40|$|Depression is {{well-known}} for having {{impact on the}} partner relationship (and vice versa), while <b>dampening</b> of positive affect has recently been discovered as a contributing factor to depression as well.

Two mediation models were hypothesized. The known associations between depression and respectively relationship quality and <b>dampening</b> were confirmed. A significant new association between relationship quality and <b>dampening</b> was found in the student sample, although it was not found in the clinical sample. <b>Dampening</b> of positive affect was found to be a significant mediator of the association between relationship quality and depression in the student sample, but not in the clinical sample. Possible explanations for these findings, limitations and suggestions for future research and practice are given...|$|R

5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from Ostend was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely <b>dampen</b> the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to <b>dampen</b> the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into an old}} {{political}} family, Playford was {{the fifth}} Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century. He {{grew up on the}} family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League (LCL) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, Richard Layton Butler, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt to <b>dampen</b> his insubordination. Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.|$|E
5000|$|Apagados (from the Spanish verb apagar, [...] "to mute") {{refers to}} notes that are played <b>dampened</b> or [...] "muted," [...] without sustain. The term is written {{above or below}} the notes with a dotted or dashed line drawn {{to the end of}} the group of notes that are to be played <b>dampened.</b> The {{technique}} is chiefly written for bowed or plucked instruments. Modernists refer to the apogado as [...] "palm mute." [...] On the guitar, the musician <b>dampens</b> the strings with the palm of the hand and plucks with the thumb. Strictly speaking, the term <b>dampened</b> is correct for this effect in music; since to mute means to silence. Illustration of the apagados may be found in the work of composer for Spanish guitar, Gerardo de Altona.

5|$|Diệm's {{denial of}} {{governmental}} {{responsibility for the}} incident, and instead blaming members of the Viet Cong insurgency, led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute {{came to be known}} as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality. At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the Cold War, had 16,000 military advisers in the country to assist the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the war against the Vietcong insurgency, which sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted the dispute with the Buddhists to be resolved quickly so that it would not <b>dampen</b> public morale and detract from the fight against the Vietcong.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to <b>dampen</b> sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
