40|$|Many {{different}} types of qualification requirement {{and other forms of}} regulations of professions exist in the Member States of the European Union. A common qualification requirement for access to a profession or use of a professional title is the possession of a diploma, certificate or other <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications</b> that proves that the person in questions has the education and experience necessary. The aim of the thesis is to examine what legal strategies the Community has developed to counteract the obstacle against free movement of workers and self-employed persons that national qualifications of this types gives rise to. The analysis is performed using an integration perspective and with its basis in the tensions between European Community law and national law that arise as Community law’s demands for free movement and equal treatment conflict with the interest of the Member States to set their own professional qualifications in accordance with national values and traditions. Central to the examination are the directives on recognition of professional qualifications adopted by the Council and the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice’s case-law on the subject. A central tasks is to analyse the contents of Community law and to study those rules from a development perspective...|$|E

The primary goal of the analysis is to extend previous work on skills gaps by educational attainment and map cross-national variation in the internal skills homogeneity of educational groups as a second dimension shaping the signaling value of educational degrees.

30|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{educational}} attainment in the sense <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications</b> is positively related to labor market outcomes. In all advanced economies, individuals with higher educational degrees have higher employment rates, occupational status, and earnings than their less-educated counterparts. At the same time, labor market returns to <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications</b> vary widely across countries (see, for example, Shavit and Müller 1998; Van de Werfhorst 2011). Social scientists have proposed several explanations for these empirical regularities (for overviews, see Bills 2003; Bills et al. 2017).
