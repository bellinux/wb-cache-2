25|$|At present, no canonical, presecribed use of colours can be detected, {{except that}} at least from Augustan times the {{background}} was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well.

In Augustan times light yellow was not unusual for skin.
