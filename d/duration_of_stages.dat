40|$|Abstract Background The <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> {{untreated}} <b>stage</b> 1 (early stage, haemo-lymphatic) {{and stage}} 2 (late stage, meningo-encephalitic) human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense are poorly quantified, but key to predicting {{the impact of}} screening on transmission. Here, we outline a method to estimate these parameters. Methods We first model the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 1 through survival analysis of untreated serological suspects detected during Médecins Sans Frontières interventions in Uganda and Sudan. We then deduce the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 2 based on the stage 1 to stage 2 ratio observed during active case detection in villages within the same sites. Results Survival in stage 1 appears to decay exponentially (daily rate = 0. 0019; mean stage 1 duration = 526 days [95 %CI 357 to 833]), possibly explaining past reports <b>of</b> abnormally long <b>duration.</b> Assuming epidemiological equilibrium, we estimate a similar <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 2 (500 days [95 %CI 345 to 769]), {{for a total of}} nearly three years in the absence of treatment. Conclusion Robust estimates of these basic epidemiological parameters are essential to formulating a quantitative understanding of sleeping sickness dynamics, and will facilitate the evaluation of different possible control strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Trachoma is {{a disease}} {{that can lead to}} visual {{impairment}} and ultimately blindness. Previous estimates of health losses from trachoma using the Global Burden of Disease methodology have not, however, included the stage prior to visual impairment. We estimated the burden of all stages of trachoma in South Sudan and assessed the uncertainty associated with the severity and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> of trachoma prior to full blindness. METHODS: The prevalence of trachoma with normal vision, low vision and blindness in the Republic of South Sudan has been estimated previously. These estimates were used to model the incidence and duration of the different stages employing DISMOD II. Different assumptions about disability weights and duration were used to estimate the Years Lived with Disability (YLD). RESULTS: We have estimated the total burden of trachoma in South Sudan to be between 136, 562 and 163, 695 YLD and trichiasis with normal vision contributes between 5 % and 21 % of the total depending on the disability weight applied. Women experience more of this burden than men. The sensitivity of the results to different assumptions about the disability weights is partly dependent upon the assumed duration of the different disease states. INTERPRETATION: A better understanding of the natural history of trachoma is critical for a more accurate burden estimate...|$|E

40|$|During oral reading, {{the eyes}} {{tend to be}} ahead of the voice (eye-voice span). It has been {{hypothesized}} that {{the extent to which}} this happens depends on the automaticity of reading processes, namely on the speed of print-to-sound conversion. We tested whether EVS is affected by another automaticity component - immunity from interference. To that end, we manipulated word familiarity (high-frequency, low-frequency and pseudowords) and word length as proxies of immunity from interference, and we used linear mixed effects models to measure the effects of both variables on the time interval at which readers do parallel processing by gazing at word N+ 1 while not having articulated word N yet (offset eye-voice span). Parallel processing was enhanced by automaticity, as shown by familiarity x length interactions on offset eye-voice span, and it was impeded by lack of automaticity, as shown by the transformation of offset eye-voice span into voice-eye span (voice ahead of the offset of the eyes) in pseudowords. The relation between parallel processing and automaticity was strengthened by the fact that offset eye-voice span predicted reading velocity. Our findings contribute to understand how the offset eye-voice span, an index that is obtained in oral reading, may tap into different components of automaticity that underlie reading ability, oral or silent. In addition, we compared the duration of the offset eye-voice span with the average reference <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> in word production, and we saw that the offset eye-voice span may accommodate for more than the articulatory programming stage of word N...|$|E

The stabilization of stage definitions by GSSPs, attainment of higher analytical precision on radio-isotopic age determinations on tuffs, recognition of climatic cycles {{recorded in the}} sedimentary record that are induced by periodic orbital changes (Milankovitch cycles), and the integration of these elements using biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic correlations leads to a more precise numerical time scale. There is a systematic offset of ~ 1. 5 my between single and multigrain U-Pb ages from the Late Permian to the Middle Triassic (Menning et al., in prep.), therefore our calibrations for all stage boundaries rely on single-grain results. We focus on cycles as time indicators from the Germanic Triassic, particularly from the Buntsandstein (s) and Muschelkalk (m), which are completely developed in the migrating center of the Central European Basin. Extending the cycle-stratigraphy into the Late Triassic is uncertain, because recent estimates of a ~ 35 -my duration for that epoch imply that the lithostratigraphic units of Central Europe are probably punctuated with gaps of uncertain duration.

40|$|The Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) {{concentrates}} on probability distribution of peak flows of flood hydrographs. However, examination of floods that haunted and devastated the {{large parts of}} Poland lead us to revision of the views on the assessment of flood risk of Polish rivers. It turned out that flooding is caused not only by overflow of the levees' crest but mostly due to the prolonged exposure to high water on levees structure causing dangerous leaks and breaches that threaten their total destruction. This is because, the levees are weakened by long-lasting water pressure {{and as a matter}} of fact their damage usually occurs after the culmination has passed the affected location. The probability of inundation is the total of probabilities of exceeding embankment crest by flood peak and the probability of washout of levees. Therefore, in addition to the maximum flow one should consider also the duration of high waters in a river channel. In the paper the new two-component model of flood dynamics: "Duration of high waters–Discharge Threshold–Probability of non-exceedance" (DqF), with the methodology of its parameters estimation was proposed as a completion to the classical FFA methods. Such model can estimate the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> (flows) of an assumed magnitude with a given probability of exceedance. The model combined with the technical evaluation of probability of levees breach due to the d -days duration of flow above alarm stage gives the annual probability of inundation caused by the embankment breaking. The results of theoretical investigation were illustrated by a practical example of the model implementation to the series of daily flow of the Vistula River at Szczucin. Regardless promising results, the method of risk assessment due to prolonged exposure of levees to high water is still in its infancy despite its great cognitive potential and practical importance. Therefore, we would like to point out the need for and usefulness of the DqF model as complementary to the analysis of the flood peak flows, as in classical FFA. The presented two-component model combined with the routine flood frequency model constitutes a new direction in FFA for embanked rivers...|$|E

40|$|Glass batch melting {{has been}} studied by many {{researchers}} on various scales and under various conditions but no comprehensive understanding has been reached. In view of this situation, {{a major part of}} this work was devoted to the improvement of five new experimental methods suitable for the investigation of batch melting. These are: conductometry, thermal diffusivity, heating microsopy, batch free time (BFT) and weight loss measurement. Firstly, as for the development of conductometry, three meaningful ways to present batch reactions in terms of "DTA", "voltage drop", and "electrical conductivity" were concluded. It was also possible to determine the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> characterized by foaming. Secondly, for thermal diffusivity, an optimized output signals at a frequency of 50 Hz with time interval of 150 s was applied. It showed good measurment results. As a conclusion, the grain-to-grain contact in model calculations should be taken into account by a dimensionless shape factor of 2. 5 to 3. 5. Local conductometry combined with temperature measurement allowed to measure simultaueously the electrical conductivity and the local temperature in a melting batch. The measurement of the local thermal diffusivity was performed by an evaluation of the runtime of a periodically generated heat pulse. Thirdly, for the heating microscope, a new way to present the effect of gas release from glass batches prior to refining was developed. It was found that minor batch additions additions have a large influence. Fourthly, the BFT results show that the reaction behavior of container flint and green glass batches was more sluggish than that of crystal glass batches. By observation through a silica tube furnace, the beginning of batch reactions with cullets at the surface deep into the glass melt were observed. After 2 minutes foam was formed and decreaed within 10 minutes. Finally, weight loss determination for samples up 200 g was developed. It was found that the mass loss of soda ash detected in a vertical tube furnace started at a lower temperature and was completed at a higher temperature than suggested by the results measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These new characterization methods not only open concepts for the presentation and interpretation of batch reactions, but also close the experimental gap between conventional lab scale characterization and the behavior actually observed in industrial production...|$|E

There were 40 respondents selected using purposive sampling, which 20 respondents assigned in the experiment and control group. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor was assessed using partograph and APGAR Score was assessed using APGAR Score assessment sheets. Mann Whitney test was used for data analysis Results: Findings showed that the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor in the experiment group was 187 minutes and in the control group was 307 minutes. Mann Whitney test obtained p-value 0. 001 (0. 05), which indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} of APGAR score in the experiment and control group. Conclusion: There was a significant effect of acupressure on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor, but no effect of the APGAR score. Therefore, acupressure may be recommended to shorten the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> delivery in primigravida. ...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{pig farming}} is still confronted with high {{perinatal}} piglet losses which are mainly contributed to {{factors associated with}} the progress of piglet expulsion. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to identify sow- and piglet factors affecting the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the expulsive <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> farrowing and piglet birth intervals in spontaneous farrowing sows originating from five different breeds. In total 211 litters were investigated. Breed affected <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the expulsive <b>stage</b> significantly: the shortest duration was found in Large White x Meishan F 2 crossbred litters and the longest duration in Dutch Landrace litters. No effect of parity on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the expulsive <b>stage</b> was found. An increase in littersize (P < 0. 01), an increase in number of stillborn piglets per litter (P < 0. 05) and a decrease of gestation length (P < 0. 05, independently of littersize) all resulted in an increased <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the expulsive <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> farrowing. A curvilinear relationship between birth interval and rank (relative position in the birth order) of the piglets was found. Besides that, piglet birth intervals increased with an increasing birth weight (P < 0. 001). Stillborn (P < 0. 01) and posteriorly presented (P < 0. 05) piglets were delivered after significantly longer birth intervals than liveborn and anteriorly presented piglets. The results on sow- and piglet factors affecting <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the expulsive <b>stage</b> and piglet birth intervals obtained in this study contribute to an increased insight into (patho) physiological aspects of perinatal mortality in pig...|$|R

30|$|One {{method is}} to shorten the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> this <b>stage,</b> which depends on the zero {{crossing}} time of the arm current: the earlier the arm current arrives at zero, the more quickly this stage will end. From (5)~(7), {{we can get the}} conclusion that the decay speed of the continuing current of the reactors have a bearing on the zero crossing time: the smaller the decay constants τ 1 and τ 2 are, then the earlier the arm current arrives at zero and the less time this stage lasts for. So we can shorten the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> this <b>stage</b> by decreasing the value of τ 1 and τ 2 which could be realized by increasing the resistance in the fault circuit artificially.|$|R

40|$|While {{there are}} no {{indications}} of mixing back to 800 000 years in the EPICA Dome C ice core record, comparison with marine sediment records shows {{significant differences in the}} timing and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> events prior to stage 11 (~ 430 ka, thousand of years before 1950). A relationship between the isotopic composition of atmospheric oxygen (δ 18 O of O 2, noted δ 18 O atm) and daily northern hemisphere summer insolation has been observed for the youngest four climate cycles. Here we use this relationship with new δ 18 O of O 2 measurements to show that anomalous flow in the bottom 500 m of the core distorts the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> events by up to a factor of 2. By tuning δ 18 O atm to orbital precession we derive a corrected thinning function and present a revised age scale for the interval corresponding to Marine Isotope Stages 11 – 20 in the EPICA Dome C ice core. Uncertainty in the phasing of δ 18 O atm with respect to insolation variations in the precession band limits the accuracy of this new agescale to ± 6 kyr (thousand of years). The previously reported ~ 30 kyr <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> interglacial <b>stage</b> 11 is unchanged. In contrast, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> 15. 1 is reduced by a factor of 2, from 31 to 16 kyr...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Sedatives {{constitute}} {{an important part}} of modern obstetric care. One of the under-investigation methods is the effect of acupressure on reduction <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> labor <b>stages.</b> This study was performed aiming at comparison of the effects of one-step acupressure of spleen point 6 (SP- 6) and gall bladder 21 (GB- 21) on the <b>duration</b> and type <b>of</b> delivery and Apgar of newborne in nulliparous women. Methods: This clinical trial study was performed on 150 nulliparous women. Women were randomly assigned to three groups, including gallbladder 21 acupressure, spleen point 6 acupressure, and control. In first two groups, pressure was performed at 3 - 4 cm cervical dilatation for 20 minutes. In the control group, contact with no pressure was done on the acupressure points and with the same condition of the intervention group. The collected data was analyzed using paired t-test, independent t-test, and one-way variance analysis. Results: In this study, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the active <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor in the intervention group was less than control group (p 0. 05). Also, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor in the control group was more than two experimental groups, but the difference was not significant (p> 0. 05). The three groups, had {{no significant difference in the}} fifth minute Apgar score (p> 0. 05). The number of cesarean sections in the intervention groups were more than control group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, the acupressure in SP- 6 and GB- 21 points, in the one-step intervention was equally effective in reducing the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> active <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> labor...|$|R
40|$|Part 5 : Algorithms and Data ManagementInternational audienceThis paper {{describes}} a b-v model which is enhanced {{version of the}} negative selection algorithm (NSA). In contrast to formerly developed approaches, binary and real-valued detectors are simultaneously used. The reason behind developing this hybrid is our willingness to overcome the scalability problems occuring when only one type of detectors is used. High-dimensional datasets are a great challenge for NSA. But the quality <b>of</b> generated detectors, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> learning <b>stage</b> as well as <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> classification <b>stage</b> need a careful treatment also. Thus, we discuss various versions of the b-v model developed to increase its efficiency.
