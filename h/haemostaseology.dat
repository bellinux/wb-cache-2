Because of its clinical relevance, this review brings into focus alloimmunization against red blood cells, human platelet antigens, human leukocyte antigens, and human neutrophil antigens. In principle, an individual {{is able to develop}} antibodies after exposure to a nonautogenous antigen, but these cells actually induce alloimmunization only for a minority of patients. An individual producing alloantibodies after having contact with foreign antigens depends on various factors, such as genetic predisposition, underlying diseases, the patient&# 39;s immune status, and clinical immune modulation. When alloimmunization has occurred, it could lead to problems for future transfusions or transplantations. Keywords: transfusion, alloimmunization, preventio...|$|E
