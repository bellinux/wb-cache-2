5000|$|The Trethurffe's {{inheritance}} {{of part of}} the Courtenay estates was supposedly foretold by the Courtenay Faggot being [...] "againe sub-divided into other twayne". The Courtenay Faggot was a mysterious naturally mis-shapen piece of wood split at the ends into four sticks, one of which again split into two, supposedly kept as a valued possession by the Courtenay Earls of Devon. It was later interpreted as an omen {{of the end of}} the line of Courtenay Earls of Devon via four heiresses. It was seen by the Cornish historian Richard Carew (died 1620) when visiting Hall in the parish of Lanteglos-by-Fowey, Cornwall, then the dower house of Margaret Reskimer, the widow of Sir William Mohun (died 1588), MP, of Hall, the great-grandson of Elizabeth Courtenay, who described it in his Survey of Cornwall as follows:A farre truer <b>foretoken</b> touching the Earle of Devon's progeny I have seen at this place of Hall, to wit, a kind of faggot, whose age and painting approveth the credited tradition that it was carefully preserved by those noble men.

40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is an earlier <b>foretoken</b> of cognitive decline than very early dementia (among which Alzheimer’s Disease). There are no internationally accepted diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis {{is based on}} clinical evaluation, neuropsychological examination, laboratory investigations, biomarkers and neurological imaging. MCI is heterogeneous. Actually therapeutical medical options do not exist, and management focuses on lifestyle strategies such as physical exercises and social activities, prevention strategies and treatment of non-cognitive symptoms. Education and support remain essential for both patients and relatives. New therapies which are currently being developed for Alzheimer’s Disease, may possibly also be effective for MCI. status: publishe...|$|E

The rain ceased and the sun began to burst out {{goldenly}} now and again between the rents in the clouds, burnishing the gray seas with copper-hued radiance, and lighting up the mists that curtained the Island's red shores with gleams of gold <b>foretokening</b> a fine day after all.

60|$|When we {{grew tired}} of our sport {{we went to the}} {{windward}} side of the field and perched ourselves on the high pole fence that skirted a dark spruce wood, full of strange, furtive sounds. Over us was a great, dark sky, blossoming with silver stars, and all around lay dusky, mysterious reaches of meadow and wood in the soft, empurpled night. Away to the east a shimmering silveryness beneath a palace of aerial cloud <b>foretokened</b> moonrise. But directly before us the potato field, with its wreathing smoke and sullen flames, the gigantic shadow of Uncle Alec crossing and recrossing it, reminded us of Peter's famous description of the bad place, and probably suggested the Story Girl's remark.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} an {{overview}} of studies {{on the theme of}} childhood and the child as a specific literary hero of old Polish hagiography. Hagiographers tended to render the childhood of the saints within a schematic framework employing an abundant repertoire of rhetoric devices. But hagiography also gives fragmentary descriptions of customs connected with the relations between parents and children as well as with parental care and the bringing up progeny. For hagiographers childhood was above all a <b>foretoken</b> of the saint’s future virtues and works. The child itself, however, was not a suitable paragon to follow so hagiography rarely treated it as a hero in its own right...|$|E
40|$|Principal {{object of}} the author’s {{research}} in work is identification of notion, cru- cial elements and evaluation of human resources management in general and apart in sport. From the beginning of usage of term “human resources management”, we use <b>foretoken</b> “strategic” that has especially signified meaning. Strategic approach to the exploration of this problem points {{to the fact that}} human resources are from particularly significance for all forms of human organization (firms, associations, institutions etc.), regardless are we talking about economy, social activity, politics, science, sport or any other area of human activity. Experience shows that, in our society, we mainly considered human resources management from the aspect of formulation and implementation of strategy in any shape and segment of altogether human activity, but we pay a little interest to the control, or in other words evaluation of human resources performance. What is attained in world rela- tions, on the human resources management plan, admonish and binds that we must ac- cept employees in our environment (it implies sport) as an equal partner in managemen...|$|E
40|$|It is possible, perhaps, {{to choose}} the right path to {{the answer to the}} {{questions}} how poetry has been disappearing over the centuries and has lost its purpose in the ever greater void of outer space and how it has turned from a common and welcome social activity into a phenomenon that will have to leave its fellow-townspeople due to enormous suspicion about the communal language, the world view of the majority and the material world, if first, (at least) a rough reconstruction of the sense and nature of continual changes in the poetic mechanism has been done (a more detailed overview would extend the paper enormously), {{as well as of the}} changes in style and the reception of poetry, since each choice of a possible linguistic system in a particular historical period soon heralded its own boundary line. From a popular, entertaining and educational genre as a transparent means of social communication, which has brought the individual into a community by generating stable certainty, and gave him the sense of control over his own destiny and meaning, lyrics will outgrow proportionally the aesthetic dimensions of its texts (which will subsequently substitute the <b>foretoken</b> of literacy), becoming less comparable and surmountable, in certain periods almost a nontransferable artistic view. In such circumstances, the public will start to have less understanding and tolerance for its 'weaknesses'...|$|E
60|$|Long {{years ago}} the tree had given up blooming, nor could all the pruning and care given it coax a single blossom from it. Miss Corona, tinctured with the superstition apt to wait on a lonely womanhood, {{believed}} in her heart that the rosebush had a secret sympathy with {{the fortunes of the}} Gordon women. She, the last of them on the old homestead, would never need the bride roses. Wherefore, then, should the old tree bloom? And now, after all these years, it had flung all its long-hoarded sweetness into blossom again. Miss Corona thrilled at the thought. The rosebush had bloomed again for a Gordon bride, but Miss Corona was sure there was another meaning in it too; she believed it <b>foretokened</b> some change in her own life, some rejuvenescence of love and beauty like to that of the ancient rose-tree. She bent over its foam of loveliness almost reverently.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a compositional {{process that is}} homogeneous to LaMothe’s four modes of organising experience: corporeal-contiguous, taxonomic-object, symbolic-subjective and narrativecommunal. It begins with the composer 2 ̆ 7 s subjective experience of hearing, rooted in the relationship of a particular human body to its physical neighbourhood (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s corporeal-contiguous modes). The human {{body is used as}} a benchmark for measuring and apprehending the world (Benthall and Polhemus 1975). The thinking body conceptualises the claim that sensation, motor functions and cognition are distributed functions of the body, in a complex interrelationship with the mind (Baily 2006). Our embodied knowledge of proprioceptive and motor activities act as constraints on interpreting music. Sonic objects (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s taxonomic-object modes) are interpreted as gestural sonic tokens, these being the smallest meaningful units of gestural information in a sound sequence. These act as signs from which metaphor can be derived, based on the composers interpretations of the meaning of the gestural sonic tokens {{in the context of the}} composition (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic-subjective modes). This process creates a sonic signscape, a sign system in which the signifier is the gestural sonic token and the signified is the imagined sound source. When used by the composer as <b>foretokens,</b> such signifiers build sequential structured relationships that form a sonic narrative. In this thesis the term sonarrative is used to describe such a sonic account of contiguous and contrapuntal events that create a coherent whole – a composition. The creative process incorporates physicality, sign, metaphor and narrative to organise a meaningful sonic experience for the listener by way of sonarratives (LaMothe 2 ̆ 7 s narrative-communal modes). In order to ground this theoretical framework in practice, the concepts are applied to a body of compositional work completed between 2009 and 2011...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the same}} writer, Claudianus [...] "pierced the sects {{with the power of}} eloquence", an allusion to a prose {{treatise}} entitled [...] "On the State of the Soul" [...] or [...] "On the Substance of the Soul". Written between 468 and 472, this work was destined to combat the ideas of Faustus, Bishop of Reii (modern Riez, in the department of Basses-Alpes), particularly his thesis on the corporeity of the soul. Plato, whom he perhaps read in Greek, Porphyry, and especially Plotinus and Saint Augustine furnished Claudianus with arguments. But his method was decidedly peripatetic and <b>foretokened</b> Scholasticism. Even his language had the same characteristics as that of some of the medieval philosophers: hence Claudianus used many abstract adverbs in [...] "ter" [...] (essentialiter, accidenter, etc.; forty according to La Broise). On the other hand, he revived obsolete words and, in a letter to Sapaudus of Vienne, a rhetorician, sanctioned the imitation of Nævius, Plautus, Varro and Gracchus. Undoubtedly his only acquaintance with these authors was through the quotations used by grammarians and the adoption of their style by Apuleius, whose works he eagerly studied. Of course this tendency to copy his predecessors led Claudianus to acquire an entirely artificial mode of expression which Sidonius, in wishing to compliment him, called a modern antique (Epist., IV, iii, 3). Besides the treatise and the letter from Claudianus to Sidonius Apollinaris, found among the letters of the latter (IV, ii), some poetry has also been ascribed to him, although erroneously. For instance, he has been credited with the [...] "Pange, lingua", which is by Venantius Fortunatus (Carm., II, ii); [...] "Contra vanos poetas ad collegam", a poem recommending the choice of Christian subjects and written by Paulinus of Nola (Carm., xxii); two short Latin poems in honour of Christ, one by Claudius Claudianus (Birt ed., p. 330; Koch ed., p. 248) and the other by Merobaudus (Vollmer ed., p. 19), and two other Greek poems on the same subject, again believed to be the work of Claudius Claudianus.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the sermon}} and the notes both the {{historical}} {{truth and the}} necessity of the miracles are strongly and frequently asserted. [...] "The testimony of books of history (that is, relatively to the signs and wonders, with which Christ came) is one of the strong and stately pillars of the church: {{but it is not the}} foundation!" [...] Instead, therefore, of defending myself, which I could easily effect by a series of passages, expressing the same opinion, from the Fathers and the most eminent Protestant Divines, from the Reformation to the Revolution, I shall merely state what my belief is, concerning the true evidences of Christianity. 1. Its consistency with right Reason, I consider as the outer court of the temple--the common area, within which it stands. 2. The miracles, with and through which the Religion was first revealed and attested, I regard as the steps, the vestibule, and the portal of the temple. 3. The sense, the inward feeling, in the soul of each believer of its exceeding desirableness--the experience, that he needs something, joined with the strong <b>foretokening,</b> that the redemption and the graces propounded to us in Christ are what he needs--this I hold to be the true foundation of the spiritual edifice. With the strong a priori probability that flows in from 1 and 3 on the correspondent historical evidence of 2, no man can refuse or neglect to make the experiment without guilt. But, 4, it is the experience derived from a practical conformity to the conditions of the Gospel--it is the opening eye; the dawning light: the terrors and the promises of spiritual growth; the blessedness of loving God as God, the nascent sense of sin hated as sin, and of the incapability of attaining to either without Christ; it is the sorrow that still rises up from beneath and the consolation that meets it from above; the bosom treacheries of the principal in the warfare and the exceeding faithfulness and long-suffering of the uninteresting ally;--in a word, it is the actual trial of the faith in Christ, with its accompaniments and results, that must form the arched roof, and the faith itself is the completing key-stone. In order to an efficient belief in Christianity, a man must have been a Christian, and this is the seeming argumentum in circulo, incident to all spiritual Truths, to every subject not presentable under the forms of Time and Space, as long as we attempt to master by the reflex acts of the Understanding what we can only know by the act of becoming. Do the will of my Father, and ye shall know whether I am of God. These four evidences I believe to have been and still to be, for the world, for the whole Church, all necessary, all equally necessary: but at present, and for the majority of Christians born in Christian countries, I believe the third and the fourth evidences to be the most operative, not as superseding but as involving a glad undoubting faith in the two former. Credidi, ideoque intellexi, appears to me the dictate equally of Philosophy and Religion, even as I believe Redemption to be the antecedent of Sanctification, and not its consequent. All spiritual predicates may be construed indifferently as modes of Action or as states of Being, Thus Holiness and Blessedness are the same idea, now seen in relation to act and now to existence. The ready belief which has been yielded to the slander of my [...] "potential infidelity," [...] I attribute in part to the openness with which I have avowed my doubts, whether the heavy interdict, under which the name of Benedict Spinoza lies, is merited on the whole or to the whole extent. Be this as it may, I wish, however, that I could find in the books of philosophy, theoretical or moral, which are alone recommended to the present students of theology in our established schools, a few passages as thoroughly Pauline, as completely accordant with the doctrines of the Established Church, as the following sentences in the concluding page of Spinoza's Ethics. Deinde quo mens hoc amore divino, seu beatitudine magis gaudet, eo plus intelligit, hoc est, eo majorem in affectus habet potentiam, et eo minus ab affectibus, qui mali sunt, patitur; atque adeo ex eo, quod mens hoc amore divino, seu beatitudine gaudet, potestatem habet libidines coercendi; et quia humana potentia ad coercendos affectus in solo intellectu consistit; ergo nemo beatitudine gaudet, quia affectus coercuit, sed contra potestas libidines coercendi ex ipsa beatitudine oritur.|$|R
