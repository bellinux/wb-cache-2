Core functions have been extended usefully... the design editor in Design-Expert (DX) has long been a strong point, providing a central cockpit from which to intuitively refine and test most aspects, but various new control features have now been added to the package, small in themselves but significantly enhancing productive control.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to develop and formulate a low density floating extended release tablet(LDFET) of Clarithromycin (CLN) for eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) from gastric mucosa. Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose K 4 M (HPMC K 4 M), Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose K 15 M (HPMC K 15 M) and Polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 30 (PVP K 30) were taken as matrix forming hydrophilic polymers and magnesiumstearate as lubricant. The % of HPMC K 4 M, HPMC K 15 M and PVP K 30 were considered as formulationvariables. Formulations were designed by D-optimal mixture design using <b>Design-Expert</b> <b>version</b> 8. 0 software. LDFETs were prepared by wet granulation method. Weight variations, content uniformity, hardness, friability,in vitro floating capacity, in vitro drug release of LDFET were evaluated. The study showed that the floating lagtime of the LDFET was zero and remained floated > 12 hours in 0. 1 N HCl acid in in vitro condition and werecapable of releasing drug over 12 hours. Analysis of drug release data showed that kinetic of drug release fromthe developed LDFETs followed zero order rate (Non-Fickian diffusion). USFDA Similarity Factor f 2 valueswere calculated to correlate the test dissolution profiles with that of USP reference values. Finally theformulation was optimized for the target responses- 15 % drug release at 2 hours, 30 % drug release at 4 hours, 60 % drug release at 8 hours and 90 % drug release at 12 hours using <b>Design-Expert</b> <b>version</b> 8. 0 software, andthe optimized formulation was evaluated for the target responses. The study showed that the responses obtainedfrom the optimized formulation were {{very close to the}} predicted and target values...|$|R

Response surface methodology coupled with small central composite design (CCD) was employed in developing the tool life and surface roughness models in relation to primary cutting parameters such as cutting speed, axial depth of cut and feed. Flank wear has been considered as the criteria for tool failure and the wear was measured under a Hisomet II Toolmaker’s microscope. Mitutoyo surftest was utilized for surface roughness measurements. <b>Design-expert</b> <b>version</b> 6. 0. 8 software was applied to establish the first-order and the second-order models and develop the contours.

In this study, an integrated in situ remediation technique which couples electrokinetics with adsorption, using locally produced {{granular activated carbon}} from date palm pits in the treatment zones that are installed directly to bracket the contaminated soils at bench-scale, is investigated. Natural saline-sodic clay soil, spiked with contaminant mixture (kerosene, phenol, Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Hg), {{was used in this}} study to investigate the effects of voltage gradient, initial contaminant concentration, and polarity reversal rate on the soil electrical conductivity. Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was used for the experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to model, optimize, and interpret the results obtained using <b>Design-Expert</b> <b>version</b> 8 platform.
