40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{variation}} in fatty acid composition of milk, and derived cheese, when dairy cows were grazed on different alpine vegetation types. An experimental design was developed to highlight the effect of pasture composition on milk and cheese fatty acid profiles, thereby mitigating the other variables (altitude, animal physiology, and animal management). Two dairy cow groups were grazed on two different key alpine vegetation types (Type 1 : Trifolium alpinum, Nardus stricta, and Carex sempervirens and Type 2 : Festuca nigrescens, Alchemilla xanthochlora, and Phleum alpinum). Bulk milk was collected separately from each group for 6 days, from which 12 artisanal cheeses were produced and ripened for 60 days. The fatty acid (FA) composition of the bulk milks and cheeses varied with the type of vegetation. Milk and cheese derived from cows that were grazed on Trifolium alpinum-dominated pastures were richer in long-chain FAs, unsaturated and monounsaturated FAs (particularly oleic acid), and odd-chain saturated FAs (such as C 15 : 0 pentadecanoic and C 17 : 0 <b>heptadecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> while those from Festuca nigrescens pastures contained more short- and medium-chain FAs, saturated FAs, and α-linolenic acid.

However, a recent study showed that even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids had opposite associations with type 2 diabetes. Limited studies of Western populations examined the associations of circulating saturated fatty acids with adipokines, {{an important role in}} glucose metabolism. We examined the associations of saturated fatty acids in serum phospholipids with circulating levels of adipokines among a Japanese population. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 Japanese employees (284 men and 200 women) aged 20 - 65 years. The serum fatty acid composition in the phospholipid fraction was measured by gas-chromatography. Serum leptin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), resistin, and visfatin were measured using a Luminex suspension bead-based multiplexed array. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between saturated fatty acids and adipokines, with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids were differentially associated with adipokines. Higher levels of even-chain saturated fatty acids (14 : 0 myristic, 16 : 0 palmitic, and 18 : 0 stearic acids) were associated with higher levels of resistin (P for trend = 0. 048) and lower levels of adiponectin (P for trend = 0. 003). By contrast, odd-chain saturated fatty acids (15 : 0 pentadecanoic and 17 : 0 <b>heptadecanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> showed inverse associations with leptin and PAI- 1 (P for trend = 0. 048 and 0. 02, respectively).

Chabahar bay located {{in the northern part of}} Oman sea in Indian ocean provides high rates of primary productivity and a diverse food source for mollusks in this area. Identification of fatty acid compositions of Chiton lamyi and study their seasonal changes in the intertidal zone of Chabahar bay. Study the meat quality by n- 6 : n- 3 ratios calculation throughout the year. Approach: Chiton lamyi species analyzed seasonally for its fatty acid compositions in foot and internal tissue separately by GC/MS chromatography. Temperature and nutrients measured monthly for evaluating their effects on investigated seasonal variations of fatty acids. Pearson analysis showed effects of measured environmental factors on studied fatty acids composition. n- 6 : n- 3 ratio calculated seasonally in order to study meat quality. Results: Thirteen fatty acids identified in foot and internal tissue of Chiton lamyi. The major Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs) were myristic, palmitic and stearic acids. The major Mono-Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs) were palmitoleic, oleic and 11 -eicosenoic acids and Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) were linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids. Palmitic acid was the most abundant in this species. Fatty acid contents of foot and internal tissue of Chiton lamyi were similar but their seasonal variations were different. Pearson analysis showed correlation among palmitic and oleic acids with silicate; oleic acid with phosphate; Linoleic and arachidonic acids with nitrate in Chiton lamyi internal tissues, but no correlation observed in foot. Although temperature showed correlation with <b>heptadecanoic</b> and methyl-heptadecanoic <b>acids</b> in Chiton lamyi foot, no correlation found in internal tissues. Also, n- 6 : n- 3 ratio calculations showed domination of n- 3 fatty acid over n- 6 only in spring.

40|$|The {{research}} was created {{on the basis}} of the knowledge gained about the influence of the diabetes mellitus type 1 on the local metabolism of the lipids in the placenta of the pregnant women with diabetes mellitus, which is still not studied thoroughly. In general, the data acquired on the content of the lipids in the placenta of the pregnant women are insufficient and not studied deeply enough. The main aim of this investigation is to determine quantitative and qualitative content of lipids in micrograms on 1 gram of the humid tissue of the placenta and register their percentage (%) in the individual groups of lipids; as well as the ratio of the fatty acid in each lipid group. Special interest is devoted to the study of the influence of the type 1 diabetes on the pregnant women themselves, their unborn children and the placenta tissue. Baring in mind that in the studies done so far there are no real papers studying the influence of the well regulated glycemia at pregnant women suffering type 1 diabetes mellitus on the lipid content in their placenta, we decided to enroll two groups of pregnant women. The first group consisting of 38 pregnant women suffering type 1 diabetes mellitus were the study group; and the other group - called control group - was represented by 34 healthy pregnant women. We took the general data from all the women: the first day of the last menstrual period, and the pregnancy was proved by determining the value of -HCG (human chorionic gonadothropin, beta-subunit) within 14 days after the missing period. The pregnant women were received in RCZDT (Referral center for diabetes in pregnancy) several times during their pregnancy in order to perform clinical surveillance, ultrasound checkup and laboratory analyses. We determined the pregnancy to be normal or disturbed according to the determination of the -HCG. During the embryonic development the CRL – crown rump length was measured as well as thereafter the fetal biometry. The first morning glucose level average was measured; the average of all the mean values of the postprandial level of the large glucose profiles was also measured and compared to the values of HbA 1 c. The quality of the glycemia regulation was controlled by determining the glycosylated (or glycated) hemoglobin A 1 c / HbA 1 c. The pregnant women were invited to regular stays in RCZDT. The exact evaluation of the gestation is done by comparing the first day of the last menstrual period and clinical evaluation of the pregnancy and then compared to the ultrasound findings. All the pregnancies from the studied and control group were finished by the caesarean at the term, after the fetal maturity was proved and the indications for the caesarean section done. The samples of the placenta tissue were collected from the central part of placenta of both groups of women. On those samples the content of the individual groups of lipids in the placenta tissue is studied. The placenta tissue without decidua and blood vessels was used to determine the content of the fatty acids. After taking the samples from the fridge unit and the procedure of defrosting them on the room temperature, the so prepared placenta tissue was used in the lipid extraction process in order to determine the concentration of the fatty acids done by the modified Folch method (287). The extraction of the lipids is done by the use of chloroform mixture : methanol in different ratios. The extraction was performed by the means of different solvents' mixtures in order to gain polar and non-polar lipids into solvent. The following day the sample was filtrated into the test tube, already balanced and soon after that the solvent was steamed in the Büchi steamer. The content of the test tube was weighted and mass of the total lipids was seen. In order to determine the precise ratio of the total lipids the <b>heptadecanoic</b> (margaric) <b>acid</b> was used as internal standard. <b>Heptadecanoic</b> (margaric) <b>acid</b> C 17 : 0 is added as internal standard in order to determine the ration of the individual fatty acids in the phospholipids (PL), free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerols/triglycerides (TAG/TG) and ester of the cholesterol (CE) fractions. The rest was build up on the preparative glass plate for thin-film chromatography. The procedure of dividing the lipid fractions was done by the thin-film chromatography method TLC – Thin Layer Chromatography. The fractions were identified by the comparison with the standard (the traveling speed of the unknown fraction equals to the traveling speed of the known standard). After TLC was performed the fractions CE, TAG/TG, FFA i CH were taken from the glass plate (picture 3.) into the test tubes for centrifuging. Samples are after that prepared for the transesterification with methanol (methanolysis). Transesterification is the procedure by which the fatty acids turn into methyl ester FAME – Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (292, 293). In this form we can determine the content of the fatty acids; the procedure of determination of the lipid content is done by the method of gas chromatography GC - Gas Chromatography. Gas chromatography GC was performed on chromatograph SRI 8610 GAS CHROMATOGRAPH (picture number 4), which is product of SRI Instruments Chromatography Systems, Torrance, CA, USA equipped with software Peak Simple for Windows. We served 30 M Quadrex column Cat. No. 007 - 23 - 30 - 0. 25 F, FSCC/Fused Silica Capillary Column, product of Quadrex Corporation, Woodbridge, USA. Column diameter was 0, 25 milimeter and impregnated with thin layer of 78 % cyanopropyl-methyl-polysiloxan and 0, 25 µm thickness. The results of the research done were as follows: - The total mass of lipids in the placenta samples were less represented in the placenta of the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus type 1 compared to the group of healthy pregnant women. The difference was not statistically significant. In the total number of lipids the most frequent were phospholipids, followed by total free fatty acids, then total cholesterolesters and in the smallest amount were triacylglycerols/triglycerides. The statistically significant difference is found in the group of total free fatty acids and in the group of total cholesterol esters: less number of total fatty acids and cholesterol esters at the pregnant women suffering from diabetes–type 1, than at women belonging to the control group. The total phospholipids was found and the group of triacylglycerols/triglycerides were less represented in the studied group than in the control group, but with no statistical significant difference. - The presence of each individual fatty acid was determined in the studied and control group of pregnant women. - In the group of total phospholipids there was statistically significant difference in the presence of myristic C 14 : 0 and lignoceric C 24 : 0 fatty acid. The myristic C 14 : 0 fatty acid was much more present in the pregnant women suffering from diabetes – type 1 than in the control group. Lignoceric fatty acid C 24 : 0 was statistically less present in the group of pregnant women suffering diabetes than at the women belonging to the control group. - In the group of triacylglycerols/triglycerides there was statistically more lauric C 12 : 0 fatty acids at the pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to the control group women. Statistically significant less number of docosahexaenoic C 22 : 6 n- 3 acid and lignoceric C 24 : 0 fatty acids at the pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to the results received in the control group. - The total free fatty acids were statistically less present in the placenta of the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus type 1 compared again to the control group. In this group of total free fatty acids there were more important statistical differences in the presence of the individual fatty acids compared to the control group. Statistical significant higher quantity was established in lauric C 12 : 0 fatty acid, whereas lower quantity of the palmitic C 16 : 0; stearic C 18 : 0; oleic C 18 : 1 n- 9; miristoleic C 14 : 1 n- 5, linoleic C 18 : 2 n- 6 and docosahexaenoic fatty acid C 22 : 6 n- 3 have been found within the placenta of the pregnant women suffering from diabetes mellitus type 1 compared to the quantities obtained in the placenta of the women in the control group. - In the group of total cholesterol-esters there was significantly more lauric C 12 : 0 fatty acid and significantly less palmitic C 16 : 0; linoleic C 18 : 2 n- 6; lignoceric C 24 : 0; docosahexaenoic fatty acid C 22 : 6 n- 3; stearic 18 : 0 and miristoleic C 14 : 1 n- 5 fatty acids in the placenta samples taken from the pregnant women suffering from the diabetes mellitus type 1 compared to the placenta samples of the women in the control group. Strict regulation of glycemia probably had influence on the changes in the content of the lipids in the placenta of the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus type 1. Regulation of glycemia was done by repeated insulin injection, diabetes diets and recommended special diet for the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus. The diet for diabetes patients consisting of 1800 kcal followed by the strict glycemia regulation with insulin and recommended food habits changements where a certain quantities of carbohydrates are interchanged with other nutrients, could have a specific influence on the content of placenta lipids. Due to the above mentioned actions certain changes happen in the composition of the fatty acids in the individual fractions of the placenta lipids. Some changes are of statistical importance and some do not undergo any statistically important changes. Statistically important changes are noticed in the presence of fatty acids with smaller number of carbon atoms in the carboxyl acid chain. At the carboxyl acids with the larger number of carbon atoms (longer chain fatty acids) had smaller presence in the placenta samples in both groups of the pregnant women. On the basis of the given experiments we can presume that the composition of the fatty acids is determined with more than one factor. We have to bare in mind that the interactive substitution can take place within the presence of the individual fatty acids. The diabetes diet in the permanent metabolic system, like the one found with the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus type 1 possibly maintains the stability of the cellular membrane. This membrane is in charge of fluidity and transport of the individual lipid fractions keeping their ration which is at the same time the basic parameter for penetration and function of the each cell within placenta. The stabile metabolism of the carbohydrates and good glycemia regulation at the pregnant women suffering diabetes mellitus type 1 can in this manner lower the lesion of the cell organelle, lesion of the cellular membrane, the damage of the incorporative lipids within the cellular membrane and at the same time lower the higher level of lipids sedimentation in the placenta tissue. This regulation also lower the frequency of the secondary complication of the main disease...|$|R

The change in the ratio of high- to low-field ion mobility of cesium in carrier gases of O 2 and N 2 showed excellent agreement with literature values. The behavior of cesium in O 2 and N 2 is used to illustrate that the ratio Kh/K as a function of effective temperature is invariant with gas type as long as the well depth of the interaction potential significantly exceeds thermal energy. From these results, it appears that the well depth of the interaction potential of the heavier ions studied here, including gramicidin S, tetrahexylammonium, and <b>heptadecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> with bath gases such as N 2 and O 2, is shallow relative to thermal energy...|$|E

The halftime value of the exponential of the external curve corresponded well with the elimination rate of 131 Ifrom the myocardium: 14. 6 Â± 4. 5 min vs. 14. 6 Â± 5. 3 min. The constant was build up of three components: free 131 Iin cardiac tissue, the almost constant activity of the radiolabeled free fatty acid (FFA) in the myocardial lipid pool, and the radioactivity of blood and noncardiac tissues. The contribution of blood and noncardiac tissue to the constant amounted to a mean value of 77 %. These findings support the analysis of externally measured time-activity curves with a monoexponential plus constant curve fit, in which background correction is not necessary. In cases where lipid storage is predominantly present, high TVzvalues, both internally and externally, were found, which were fitted with a monoexponential curve. It can be concluded that externally measured time-activity curves reflect satisfactorily the kinetics of radioiodinated <b>heptadecanoic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|E
