25|$|Contextual effects {{occur as}} a result of the degree of {{similarity}} between the encoding context and the retrieval context of an emotional dimension. The main findings are that the current mood we are in affects what is attended, encoded and ultimately retrieved, as reflected in two similar but subtly different effects: the mood congruence effect and mood-state dependent retrieval. Positive encoding contexts have been connected to activity in the right <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus.</b> Negative encoding contexts have been correlated to activity in the right amygdala (Lewis & Critchley, 2003). However, Lewis and Critchley (2003) claim that it is not clear whether involvement of the emotional system in encoding memory differs for positive or negative emotions, or whether moods at recall lead to activity in the corresponding positive or negative neural networks.|$|E
500|$|The mirror neuron system {{consists}} of a class of neurons that was first studied in the 1990s in macaque monkeys. [...] Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks. This suggests they {{play a role in}} mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements. These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system. Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans. There is evidence that mirror neurons exist in humans as well as in non-human animals. The right <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus,</b> left inferior parietal lobule, right anterior parietal cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus are of particular interest. Some researchers believe that mu wave suppression can be a consequence of mirror neuron activity throughout the brain, and represents a higher-level integrative processing of mirror neuron activity. Tests in both monkeys (using invasive measuring techniques) and humans (using EEG and fMRI) have found that these mirror neurons not only fire during basic motor tasks, but also have components that deal with intention. There is evidence of an important role for mirror neurons in humans, and mu waves may represent a high level coordination of those mirror neurons.|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{prosopagnosia}} (CP) {{refers to}} the lifelong impairment in face recognition in individuals who have intact low-level visual processing, normal cognitive abilities, and no known neurological disorder. Although the face recognition impairment is profound and debilitating, its neural basis remains elusive. To investigate this, we conducted detailed morphometric and volumetric analyses of the occipitotemporal (OT) cortex {{in a group of}} CP individuals and matched control subjects using high-spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Although there were no significant group differences in the depth or deviation from the midline of the OT or collateral sulci, the CP individuals evince a larger anterior and posterior middle temporal gyrus and a significantly smaller anterior <b>fusiform</b> (aF) <b>gyrus.</b> Interestingly, this volumetric reduction in the aF gyrus is correlated with the behavioral decrement in face recognition. These findings implicate a specific cortical structure as the neural basis of CP and, in light of the familial history of CP, target the aF gyrus as a potential site for further, focused genetic investigation...|$|R
50|$|Ortigue et al. {{found that}} an {{unconscious}} prime {{of the name of}} a romantic partner activated similar brain regions as when subjects were consciously aware of seeing partners' faces. Subliminal priming with either a beloved's name or a favorite hobby activated emotion and motivational brain regions: caudate nucleus, insula, bilateral <b>fusiform</b> regions, parahippocampal <b>gyrus,</b> right angular gyrus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. However, the love prime evoked more activation in bilateral angular gyri and bilateral fusiform regions than the hobby prime. These regions are associated with integrating abstract representations, and the angular gyrus in particular is involved with abstract representations of the self. The authors also found a correlation (r=0.496, p=0.002) between activation of a region of the angular gyrus with a passionate-love scale measuring subjective feelings of love.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{functional}} connectivity {{support the hypothesis}} that the brain is composed of distinct networks with anatomically separated nodes but common functionality.

In this fMRI study, we performed an exploratory analysis {{of the relationship between the}} brain's functional connectivity and intelligence scores derived from the Portuguese language version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) in a sample of 29 people, born and raised in Brazil. We examined functional connectivity between 82 regions, including graph theoretic properties of the overall network. Some previous findings were extended to the Portuguese-speaking population, specifically the presence of small-world organization of the brain and relationships of intelligence with connectivity of frontal, pre-central, parietal, occipital, <b>fusiform</b> and supramarginal <b>gyrus</b> and caudate nucleus.

2500|$|Faces are an {{important}} part of one's social life. [...] To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of implicit memory. REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit visuospatial memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for explicit memory consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. [...] A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.|$|E

40|$|Emotional and {{cognitive}} abnormalities {{are common in}} adult hypothyroidism. Few studies, however, have evaluated cerebral perfusion and metabolism in this disorder. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between hypothyroid patients and healthy subjects and assess flow during the euthyroid state after treatment. Methods: Ten mildly hypothy-roid patients, before and after thyroxine treatment, and 10 healthy controls underwent 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime brain SPECT, MRI, and psychometric testing. SPECT images were an-alyzed using statistical parametric mapping. Results: Compared with controls, rCBF in patients before treatment was lower in right parietooccipital gyri, cuneus, posterior cingulate, lingual <b>gyrus,</b> <b>fusiform,</b> insula, and pre- and postcentral gyri. Perfusion did not normalize on a return to the euthyroid state. Conclusion: De-creased rCBF in mild hypothyroidism is found in regions mediating attention, motor speed, memory, and visuospatial processing, fac-ulties affected in hypothyroidism.

40|$|The dorsomedial {{prefrontal cortex}} (dmPFC) is {{consistently}} involved in tasks requiring {{the processing of}} mental states, and much rarer so by tasks that do not involve mental state inferences. We hypothesized that the dmPFC might be more generally involved in high construal of stimuli, defined as the formation of concepts or ideas by omitting non-essential features of stimuli, irrespective of their social or non-social nature. In an fMRI study, we presented pictures of a person engaged in everyday activities (social stimuli) or of objects (non-social stimuli) and induced {{a higher level of}} construal by instructing participants to generate personality traits of the person or categories to which the objects belonged. This was contrasted against a lower level task where participants had to describe these same pictures visually. As predicted, we found strong involvement of the dmPFC in high construal, with substantial overlap across social and non-social stimuli, including shared activation in the vmPFC/OFC, parahippocampal, <b>fusiform</b> and angular <b>gyrus,</b> precuneus, posterior cingulate and right cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Rab-GDI {{mutations}} {{are responsible}} for "pure" mental deficiency, without any specific clinical features or brain malformation. Therefore, screening for mutations in mentally retarded patients is not available on a routine basis. Moreover, neuronal networks involved in mental deficiency still remain largely unknown. Methods: We performed a fine neuropsychological and imaging study in five patients from two unrelated families, affected with mental deficiency due to a mutation in the Rab-GDI gene. High resolution 3 D brain MRI of the five mentally retarded adult males (mean age 33 years) were compared to MRI of 14 healthy males (mean age 35 years) using a Voxel-Based Morphometric analysis (VBM). Results: All patients had isolated moderate mental retardation (WAIS-III IQ range, 41 - 50; mean 45) without specific morphological or behavioural features. No obvious brain abnormality was observed on visual inspection of individual scans. Using VBM analysis, Rab-GDI mutated patients' MRIs exhibited significant brain changes compared to normal subjects (p < 0. 05, corrected for multiple comparisons) : increased grey matter density in left cerebellum and in left angular gyrus, decreased grey matter volume in thalami, decreased white matter density in prefrontal lobes, right <b>fusiform</b> occipito-temporal <b>gyrus,</b> and decreased white matter volume in cerebellar peduncles. Conclusions: These morphological changes observed in Rab-GDI mutated patients, mainly localized in the cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal pathway, {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the cerebellum is one of the critical components of a global learning network. Our results open new avenues in the diagnosis of non-specific mental deficiency using gene-specific "brain maps" as endophenotypes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Anatomically, the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> is {{the largest}} macro-anatomical {{structure}} within the ventral temporal cortex, which mainly includes structures involved in high-level vision. The term <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> (lit. „spindle-shaped convolution“) refers {{to the fact that}} the shape of the gyrus is wider at its centre than at its ends. This term is based on the description of the gyrus by Emil Huschke in 1854. (see also section on history). The <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> is situated at the basal surface of the temporal and occipital lobes and isdelineated by the collateral sulcus (CoS) and occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), respectively.

40|$|Visual {{information}} about the shape and location of objects is processed with different but interrelated pathways. Considerably less is understood {{about the existence of}} similar pathways in the tactile domain and how the tactile and visual domains converge to form a coherent multisensory percept. The present fMRI study was conducted to determine how the tactile and visual modalities interact during both shape ("what") and location ("where") tasks. In the visual-visual condition, the "what" task activated a large number of brain areas not observed in the "where" task including hippocampus, <b>fusiform</b> and lingual <b>gyrus,</b> middle and inferior frontal gyri. No additional brain areas were stimulated in the "where" than "what" tasks suggesting that "where" tasks recruit a subset of those brain areas involved in matching information relating to identity. In contrast, activity during the tactile-tactile condition differed according to task. Activity during the "what" task was greater in the right superior temporal gyrus, and during the "where" task in the left inferior parietal lobule. Brain areas activated during visuo-tactile object recognition included areas previously implicated in visuo-tactile object matching tasks. These areas were not similarly active during the visuo-tactile "where" task suggesting they may be specific for crossmodal object recognition...|$|R
40|$|Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) showed reduced {{volume of}} {{amygdala}} and hippocampus, but similar findings {{are evident in}} Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in a larger cohort of patients with BPD, we sought to extend earlier findings of volume abnormalities in limbic regions and to evaluate the influence of co-occurring PTSD in BPD patients. We used voxel-based morphometry to study gray matter volume (GMV) in 60 healthy controls (HC) and 60 patients with BPD. Subgroup analyses on 53 patients concerning the role of co-occurring PTSD were conducted. Additionally, regression analyses were calculated to assess the relation between borderline symptom severity as well as dissociative experiences and GMV. Differences in local GMV between patients with BPD and HC were observed in the amygdale and hippocampus {{as well as in}} the <b>fusiform</b> and cingulate <b>gyrus.</b> Co-occurring PTSD was accompanied by increased GMV in the superior temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Independent of co-occurring PTSD, severity of BPD symptoms predicted smaller GMV in the amygdala and dorsal ACC. Dissociation was positively related to GMV in the middle temporal gyrus. We could replicate earlier findings of diminished limbic GMV in patients with BPD and additionally show that patients with co-morbid PTSD feature increased GMV in prefrontal regions associated with cognitive control.

40|$|Semantic memory {{refers to}} {{knowledge}} about people, objects, actions, relations, self, and culture acquired through experience. The neural systems that store and retrieve this information {{have been studied}} for many years, but a consensus regarding their identity has not been reached. Using strict inclusion criteria, we analyzed 120 functional neuroimaging studies focusing on semantic processing. Reliable areas of activation in these studies were identified using the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) technique. These activations formed a distinct, left-lateralized network comprised of 7 regions: posterior inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal <b>gyrus,</b> <b>fusiform</b> and parahippocampal gyri, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Secondary analyses showed specific subregions of this network associated with knowledge of actions, manipulable artifacts, abstract concepts, and concrete concepts. The cortical regions involved in semantic processing can be grouped into 3 broad categories: posterior multimodal and heteromodal association cortex, heteromodal prefrontal cortex, and medial limbic regions. The expansion of these regions in the human relative to the nonhuman primate brain may explain uniquely human capacities to use language productively, plan, solve problems, and create cultural and technological artifacts, all of which depend on the fluid and efficient retrieval and manipulation of semantic knowledge...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> has a {{contentious}} history that {{has recently been}} clarified. The term was first used in 1854 by Emil Huschke from Jena, Germany, who called the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> a “Spindelwulst” (lit. spindle bulge). He chose this term because of the similarity that the respective cerebral gyrus bears {{to the shape of}} a spindle, or fusil, due to its wider central section. At first, researchers located the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> in other mammals as well, without taking into account the variations in gross organizations of other species’ brains. Today, the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> is considered to be specific to hominoids. This is supported by research showing only three temporal gyri and no <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> in macaques.|$|E

30|$|There {{is limited}} work {{exploring}} {{the relationship between}} individual differences in face identification and associated brain structure and neural processing differences. In early work, Schretlen, Pearlson, Anthony, and Yates (2001) suggested that the ventricle-to-brain ratio accounted for 25 % of individual variance in a face discrimination task. Rotshtein, Geng, Driver, and Dolan (2007) showed that individual variation in sensitivity to configural changes in faces was correlated with face recognition performance, with self-rated face recognition ability, and also with measures of brain activation of face-related areas, such as the <b>fusiform</b> and occipital <b>gyrus.</b> More recent work has found links between regional grey matter volume {{in the brain and}} face recognition deficits in those with schizophrenia (Onitsuka et al., 2005) and developmental prosopagnosia (Garrido et al., 2009; also see work on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences by Gomez et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Tavor et al., 2014). In healthy participants, Li et al. (2016) found that grey matter volume of the right ventral anterior temporal lobe is positively correlated with face recognition ability, as measured using the Cambridge Face Memory task (Duchaine & Nakayama, 2006). Interestingly, the grey matter volume of other brain areas linked to face recognition - the FFA (Kanwisher et al., 1997) and the OFA (Pitcher et al., 2011) - was not significantly correlated with face identification performance.|$|R
40|$|Subjective {{assessment}} of emotional valence is {{typically associated with}} both brain activity and autonomic arousal. Accurately assessing emotional salience is particularly important when perceiving threat. We sought to characterise the neural correlates {{of the interaction between}} behavioural and autonomic responses to potentially threatening visual and auditory stimuli. 25 healthy male subjects underwent fMRI scanning whilst skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. 180 pictures, sentences and sounds were assessed as ‘harmless’ or ‘threatening’. Individuals’ stimulus-locked, phasic SCRs and trial-by-trial behavioural assessments were entered as regressors into a flexible factorial design to establish their separate autonomic and behavioural neural correlates, and convolved to examine psycho-autonomic interaction effects. Across all stimuli, ‘threatening’, compared with ‘harmless’ behavioural assessments were associated with mainly frontal and precuneus activation with specific within-modality activations including bilateral parahippocampal gyri (pictures), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and frontal pole (sentences) and right Heschl’s gyrus and bilateral temporal gyri (sounds). Across stimulus modalities SCRs were associated with activation of parieto-occipito-thalamic regions, an activation pattern which was largely replicated within-modality. In contrast, psycho-autonomic interaction analyses revealed modality-specific activations including right <b>fusiform</b> / parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> (pictures), right insula (sentences) and mid-cingulate gyrus (sounds). Phasic SCR activity was positively correlated with an individual’s propensity to assess stimuli as ‘threatening’. SCRs may modulate cognitive assessments on a ‘harmless - threatening’ dimension, thereby modulating affective tone and hence behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cognitive {{models of}} {{depression}} suggest that major depression {{is characterized by}} biased facial emotion processing, making facial stimuli particularly valuable for neuroimaging research on the neurobiological correlates of depression. The present review {{provides an overview of}} functional neuroimaging studies on abnormal facial emotion processing in major depression. Our main objective was to describe neurobiological differences between depressed patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs) regarding brain responsiveness to facial expressions and, furthermore, to delineate altered neural activation patterns associated with mood-congruent processing bias and to integrate these data with recent functional connectivity results. We further discuss methodological aspects potentially explaining the heterogeneity of results. Methods A Medline search was performed up to August 2011 in order to identify studies on emotional face processing in acutely depressed patients compared with HCs. A total of 25 studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. Results The analysis of neural activation data showed abnormalities in MDD patients in a common face processing network, pointing to mood-congruent processing bias (hyperactivation to negative and hypoactivation to positive stimuli) particularly in the amygdala, insula, parahippocampal <b>gyrus,</b> <b>fusiform</b> face area, and putamen. Furthermore, abnormal activation patterns were repeatedly found in parts of the cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex, which are extended by investigations implementing functional connectivity analysis. However, despite several converging findings, some inconsistencies are observed, particularly in prefrontal areas, probably caused by heterogeneities in paradigms and patient samples. Conclusions Further studies in remitted patients and high-risk samples are required to discern whether the described abnormalities represent state or trait characteristics of depression. </p...|$|R

In a study that compared the semantic knowledge of category versus attributes, {{it was found that}} they play separate roles in how they contribute to recognition. For categorical comparisons, the lateral regions of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> were activated by living objects, in comparison to nonliving objects which activated the medial regions. For attribute comparisons, {{it was found that the}} right <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> was activated by global form, in comparison to local details which activated the left <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus.</b> These results suggest that the type of object category determines which region of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> is activated for processing semantic recognition, whereas the attributes of an object determines the activation in either the left or right <b>fusiform</b> <b>gyrus</b> depending on whether global form or local detail is processed.|$|E

40|$|Reading in many {{alphabetic}} writing systems {{depends on}} both item-specific knowledge {{used to read}} irregular words (sew, yacht) and generative spelling-sound knowledge used to read pseudowords (tew, yash). Research into the neural basis of these abilities has been directed largely by cognitive accounts proposed by the dual-route cascaded and triangle models of reading. We develop a framework that enables predictions for neural activity {{to be derived from}} cognitive models of reading using 2 principles: (a) {{the extent to which a}} model component or brain region is engaged by a stimulus and (b) how much effort is exerted in processing that stimulus. To evaluate the derived predictions, we conducted a meta-analysis of 36 neuroimaging studies of reading using the quantitative activation likelihood estimation technique. Reliable clusters of activity are localized during word versus pseudoword and irregular versus regular word reading and demonstrate a great deal of convergence between the functional organization of the reading system put forward by cognitive models and the neural systems activated during reading tasks. Specifically, left-hemisphere activation clusters are revealed reflecting orthographic analysis (occipitotemporal cortex), lexical and/or semantic processing (anterior <b>fusiform,</b> middle temporal <b>gyrus),</b> spelling-sound conversion (inferior parietal cortex), and phonological output resolution (inferior frontal gyrus). Our framework and results establish that cognitive models of reading are relevant for interpreting neuroimaging studies and that neuroscientific studies can provide data relevant for advancing cognitive models.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between awareness and attention {{is complex and}} controversial. A growing body of literature {{has shown that the}} neural bases of consciousness and endogenous attention (voluntary attention) are independent. The important role of exogenous attention (reflexive attention) on conscious experience has been noted in several studies. However, exogenous attention can also modulate subliminal processing, suggesting independence between the two processes. The question of whether visual awareness and exogenous attention rely on independent mechanisms under certain circumstances remains unanswered. Methods: In the current study, electroencephalograph recordings were conducted using 64 channels from 16 subjects while subjects attempted to detect faint speed changes of colored rotating dots. Awareness and attention were manipulated throughout trials in order to test whether exogenous attention and visual awareness rely on independent mechanisms. Results: Neural activity related to consciousness was recorded in the following cue-locked time-windows (event related potential, cluster- based permutation test) : 0 – 50, 150 – 200, and 750 – 800 ms. With a more liberal threshold, the inferior occipital lobe was found to be the source of awareness-related activity in the 0 – 50 ms range. In the later 150 – 200 ms range, activity in the <b>fusiform</b> and post-central <b>gyrus</b> was related to awareness. Awareness-related activation in the later 750 – 800 ms range was more widely distributed. This awareness-related activation pattern was quite different from that of attention. Attention-related neural activity was emphasized in the 750 – 800 ms time window and the main source of attention-related activity was localized to the right angular gyrus. These results suggest that exogenous attention and visual consciousness correspond to different and relatively independent neural mechanisms and are distinct processes under certain conditions...|$|R

Both these regions are distinct from areas that respond to other types of complex stimuli, such as faces or colored patterns, and are part of a functionally specialized ventral pathway. Within 100 milliseconds (ms) of fixating on a word, an area of the left inferotemporal cortex processes its surface structure.
