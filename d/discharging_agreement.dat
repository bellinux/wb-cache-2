Data were collected during an STD health facility survey in Malawi; the performance of 49 providers was observed, and the providers were also interviewed; 20 of them were visited by a simulated patient complaining of urethral <b>discharge.</b> <b>Agreement</b> (based on the kappa statistic) was generally poor between direct observation and provider-interview data, and also between direct observation and simulated-patient data. In contrast, percentage agreements between direct observation and simulated-patient data were often high. Multiple observations on providers indicated that a provider's behaviour is not consistent across several patients. Simulated-patient data are probably the best in reflecting normal performance, but their feasibility for routine quality assessment is limited because the provider's behaviour is not consistent and would require multiple data points. Direct observation data are the best option for assessing quality if the results are assumed to reflect better than normal levels of quality of care. Data from interviews with providers should be viewed with caution, because they may reflect provider knowledge and not necessarily performance...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{validate}} {{the performance of}} the most commonly used formulas for estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) against measured GFR during the index hospitalisation for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Setting: Single centre, methodological study. Participants: 40 patients with percutaneous coronary intervention-treated STEMI were included between November 2011 and February 2013. Patients on dialysis, cardiogenic shock or known allergy to iodine were excluded. Outcome measures: Creatinine and cystatin C were determined at admission and before discharge in 40 patients with STEMI. Clearance of iohexol was measured (mGFR) before discharge. We evaluated and compared the Cockcroft-Gault (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-IDMS), the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) and the Grubb relative cystatin C (rG-CystC) with GFR regarding correlation, bias, precision and accuracy (P 30). Agreement between eGFR and mGFR to discriminate CKD was assessed by Cohens. statistics. Results: MDRD-IDMS and CKD-EPI demonstrated good performance to estimate GFR (correlation 0. 78 vs 0. 81 %, bias - 1. 3 % vs 1. 5 %, precision 17. 9 vs 17. 1 mL/min 1. 73 m(2) and P 30 82. 5 % vs 82. 5 % for MDRD-IDMS vs CKD-EPI). CKD was best classified by CKD-EPI (. 0. 83). CG showed the worst performance (correlation 0. 73 %, bias - 1 % to 3 %, precision 22. 5 mL/min 1. 73 m(2) and P 30 75 %). The rG-CystC formula had a marked bias of - 17. 8 % and significantly underestimated mGFR (p= 0. 03).

Complete data were available for 65 patients and CGs. Compared with acute stroke, there were improvements in GOHAI and SF- 12 scores from patient's and CG's perspective at 6 -month follow-up. Caregivers overestimated the impact of stroke on MCS- 12 {{over a period of}} time (P < 0 · 01) and underestimated the impact on GOHAI during acute stroke (P < 0 · 001) and on PCS- 12 6 months later (P < 0 · 05). Patient-CG agreement was substantial to excellent during acute stroke [intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC 0 · 69 - 0 · 86) ] and fair-to-moderate 6 months later (ICC 0 · 28 - 0 · 60). Agreement was adequate between patients' and CGs' assessment of patient OHRQoL during acute stroke but it was less reliable 6 months after hospital discharge. These findings suggest that proxy assessment of OHRQoL after stroke is effective in assessing stroke-related oral impairments that affect life quality without placing additional burden on stroke patients themselves to assess OHRQoL. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The observed phenomena are related to the transition of the discharge from diffusion-controlled to electron-oscillation-amplitude-controlled breakdowns. The sustaining mechanisms of the plasma and the electron dynamics are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The POLFLOW {{model has}} been mainly {{developed}} to estimate nutrient concentration in a catchment (De Wit 2001; Jarsjö et al. 2004; Durdu 2005). In this study, the POLFLOW {{model has been}} adapted, modified and extended to estimate water availability, water demand, and water stress in the Pra Basin of Ghana. The estimated river <b>discharge</b> is in <b>agreement</b> with the measured discharge. The shallow and deep groundwater recharge and residence times were also estimated. Most of the shallow groundwater drains into the adjacent stream in less than 2  years, while it takes longer time for deep groundwater to join the streams. The total water demand estimation was divided into domestic, industrial, and agriculture. The estimated total water demand significantly increased from 2000 to 2050; therefore, the first null hypothesis which states that, “there will be {{no significant difference between}} the estimated water demand in 2000 and 2050,” is rejected. The number of districts experiencing water stress will significantly increase from 8 in 2000 to 21 out of 35 districts by the year 2050; therefore, the second null hypothesis which states that “the number of districts experiencing water stress in the basin will not significantly differ in the years 2000 and 2050,” is rejected. Though POLFLOW is mainly used to estimate nutrient concentration, this study has demonstrated that it can be modified to model water stress in the tropics.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} statistical scheme for estimating river discharges on the River Niger has been derived using catchment rainfall data. Observed station annual average discharges at two locations {{were correlated with}} averaged annual rainfall data in recent years (1951 – 2000). A comparison of the estimated discharge and the observed <b>discharge</b> showed good <b>agreement.</b> The upstream station of Gaya {{on the border of}} Niger and Nigeria, with more extensive records, was used to validate the technique. A more limited discharge record at Lokoja, at {{the focal point of the}} Niger Delta, is used to reconstruct the discharge over 1951 – 2000. Despite the extensive dam construction on the Upper Niger during this period the main determinant of flow into the Delta has remained upstream rainfall. The relationship between the past rainfall data and river discharges at Lokoja are used to predict flows in the 2070 s using rainfall values derived from various scenarios of a set of coupled climate model simulations. While there is uncertainty even over the sign of future change in west African rainfall, the river flow inferred from those models predicting increased rainfall over the coming century is at a level consistent with rapid change in channel position, as observed during the 1990 s. This technique could be applied more widely to forecast future discharges from major river systems...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{magnetic}} drive using electrical pulsed {{power has been}} considered impractically slow for traditional inertial confinement implosion of fusion targets. However, if the target contains a preheated, magnetized plasma, magnetothermal insulation may allow the near-adiabatic compression of such a target to fusion conditions on a much slower time scale. 100 -MJ-class explosive flux compression generators with implosion kinetic energies far beyond those available with conventional fusion drivers, are an inexpensive means to investigate such magnetized target fusion (MTF) systems. One means of obtaining the preheated and magnetized plasma required for an MTF system is the recently reported {open_quotes}MAGO{close_quotes} concept. MAGO is a unique, explosive-pulsed-power driven discharge in two cylindrical chambers joined by an annular nozzle. Joint Russian-American MAGO experiments have reported D-T neutron yields in excess of 10 {sup 13 } from this plasma preparation stage alone, without going on to the proposed separately driven NM implosion of the main plasma chamber. Two-dimensional MED computational modeling of MAGO <b>discharges</b> shows good <b>agreement</b> to experiment. The calculations suggest that after the observed neutron pulse, a diffuse Z-pinch plasma with temperature in excess of 100 eV is created, which may be suitable for subsequent MTF implosion, in a heavy liner magnetically driven by explosive pulsed power. Other MTF concepts, such as fiber-initiated Z-pinch target plasmas, are also being computationally and theoretically evaluated. The status of our modeling efforts will be reported...|$|R
