40|$|Abstract Intracrystalline water {{adsorption}} of Ca-montmorillonite {{was calculated}} {{as the product}} of one-half the interlayer spacing from X-ray powder diffraction analysis and the difference between the desorption surface area determined with ethylene glycol-monoethyl ether and BET surface area determined by N 2 adsorption. Osmotic adsorption was calculated {{as the product of}} the N 2 surface area and theoretical double layer thickness. Measured water adsorption of P 2 Os-dry clay, compacted to initial densities (3 'o) from 0. 52 to 1. 59 g/cm 3 and submerged in 0. 01 N CaCl 2 was 2. 4 to 4. 2 times greater than intracrystalline plus osmotic adsorption due to the occurrence ofpores exceeding double layer dimensions. The increase in expansion caused by reducing electrolyte concentration to 0. 001 N was equal to the predicted increase in double layer volume, verifying the existence of an osmotic omponent toswelling. Measured expansion following submersion i 0. 01 N CaC 12 increased continuously with 3 'o from 0. 53 cm 3 /g at 3 " 0 = 0. 52 g/cm 3 to 1. 17 cma/g at 3 ' 0 = 1. 59 g/cm ~, while estimated osmotic plus <b>intracrystalline</b> <b>expansion</b> was constant at 0. 30 cmVg. This discrepancy isattributed to swelling caused by gas pressures developing ahead of advancing wetting fronts. The effect of compaction on expansion is explained by reductions in pore size, as measured by N 2 desorption, which accompany compaction. Reduced pore size should increase ntrapped air pressures, whereas gradual wetting should favor their dissipation. Accord-ingly, slow wetting reduced the expansion of a sample where Y 0 = 1. 06 g/cm 3 from 0. 77 to 0. 37 cm 3 /g. Swelling due to entrapped air pressures produced a large {{increase in the number of}} pores> 104 A. in di-ameter, as determined by Hg intrusion porosimetry...|$|E
