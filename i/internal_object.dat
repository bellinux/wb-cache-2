2500|$|Schizoid {{individuals}} frequently act {{out with}} substance {{and alcohol abuse}} and other addictions which serve as substitutes for human relationships (see dual diagnosis). The substitute of a nonhuman for a human object serves as a schizoid defense. Providing examples of how the schizoid individual creates a personal relation with the drug, Seinfeld tells of an addict who called heroin his [...] "soothing white pet," [...] and of others who referred to crack as their [...] "bad mama" [...] or [...] "boyfriend." [...] He explains that [...] "Not all addicts name their drug, but there often is the trace of a personal feeling about the relationship." [...] The object relations view emphasizes that the drug use and alcoholism reinforce the fantasy of union with an <b>internal</b> <b>object,</b> yet enable the addict to be indifferent to the external object world. Addiction is therefore a schizoid and symbiotic defense.|$|E

2500|$|Fantasy {{is also a}} {{relationship}} with the world and with others by proxy. It is a substitute relationship, but {{a relationship}} nonetheless, characterized by idealized, defensive and compensatory mechanisms. This is self-contained and free from the dangers and anxieties associated with emotional connection to real persons and situations. Klein explains it as [...] "an expression of the self struggling to connect to <b>objects,</b> albeit <b>internal</b> <b>objects.</b> Fantasy permits schizoid patients to feel connected, and yet still free from the imprisonment in relationships. In short, in fantasy one can be attached (to <b>internal</b> <b>objects)</b> and still be free." [...] This aspect of schizoid pathology has been generously elaborated in works by Laing, Winnicott, and Klein.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for authoring video-based hypermedia. It defines an XML-based (Extensible Markup Language) data modeling language called HyperVideo Authoring Language (HyVAL) for constructing structured documents {{in which the}} composition of <b>internal</b> video <b>objects</b> (segments, scenes, shots, frames and visual objects in frames) and external media objects (text, audio, images, html pages, etc.) is specified. The model allows an author to interactively specify various <b>internal</b> <b>objects</b> and relationship among <b>internal</b> and external <b>objects.</b> Through the language, a flexible presentation of video-based hypermedia is achieved and comprehensive viewer interactions with video objects are carried out. The experiment of structuring video-based hypermedia using HyVAL in our authoring and presentation environment is also described in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Klein {{argued that}} people who never succeed in working through the {{depressive}} position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings {{over the death of}} a loved one, may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there {{because of a lack of}} differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> forever.|$|E
50|$|Fairbairn {{states that}} the object {{relations}} a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> relation describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When {{the needs of the}} child are not met by the parents (e.g. dependency needs and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> relations.|$|E

50|$|Depressive {{anxiety is}} a term {{developed}} {{in relation to the}} depressive position by Melanie Klein, building on Freud's seminal article on object relations of 1917, 'Mourning and Melancholia'. Depressive anxiety revolved around a felt state of inner danger produced by the fear of having harmed good <b>internal</b> <b>objects</b> - as opposed to the persecutory fear of ego annihilation more typical of paranoid anxiety.|$|R
5000|$|Melanie Klein {{extended}} Freud's {{concept of}} fantasy {{to cover the}} developing child's relationship to a world of <b>internal</b> <b>objects.</b> In her thought, this kind of 'play activity inside the person is known as [...] "unconscious fantasy". And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive. They are different from ordinary day-dreams or [...] "fantasies" [...] (spelled with an [...] "f")'.|$|R
50|$|Many web {{application}} frameworks offer an active record and object-relational mapping features, where external data in serialization formats is automatically converted on input into <b>internal</b> <b>objects</b> and, in turn, into database record fields. If the framework's interface for that conversion is too permissive {{and the application}} designer doesn't mark specific fields as immutable, it's possible to overwrite fields that were never intended to be modified from outside (e.g. admin permissions flag).|$|R

5000|$|Beside byte stream-based pipelines, {{there are}} also object pipelines. In an object pipeline, {{processing}} elements output objects instead of text.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} the ego, id, and <b>internal</b> <b>objects.</b> While ego psychology views the ego as autonomous of the drives, a less well-known alternative position views the ego as constituted by the drives. Based on Freud’s ego-instinct account, this position has developed into a school of thought which postulates that the drives act as knowers. Given that there are multiple drives, this position proposes that personality is constituted by multiple knowers. Following on from Freud, the ego is viewed as a composite sub-set of the instinctual drives (ego-drives), whereas those drives cut off from expression form the id. The nature of the ‘self’ is developed in terms of identification and the possibility of multiple personalities is also established. This account is then extended to object-relations and the explanatory value of the ego-drive account is discussed in terms of the addressing the nature of ego-structures and the dynamic nature of <b>internal</b> <b>objects.</b> Finally, the impact of psychological conflict and the significance of repression for understanding the nature of splits within the psyche are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|Through {{repeated}} {{experience with}} good enough parenting, the internal image {{that the child}} has of external others, that is the child's <b>internal</b> <b>object,</b> is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the pleasure principle is modified by the reality principle.|$|E

50|$|Lacan engaged {{from early}} {{on with the}} phantasies {{revealed}} by Melanie Klein...the imago of the mother...this shadow of the bad <b>internal</b> <b>objects</b> — with the Imaginary. Increasingly, however, it was Freuds idea of fantasy {{as a kind of}} screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected that was for him of greater importance. Lacan came to believe that the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition.|$|R
50|$|Encapsulation {{prevents}} users {{from breaking}} the invariants of the class, which is useful {{because it allows}} {{the implementation of a}} class of objects to be changed for aspects not exposed in the interface without impact to user code. The definitions of encapsulation focus on the grouping and packaging of related information (cohesion) rather than security issues. OOP languages do not normally offer formal security restrictions to the <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> state. Using a method of access is a matter of convention for the interface design.|$|E

50|$|The third {{power is}} known as Swap. This power is an {{extension}} of the echo and allows Zero's echo to swap places with an object of the player's choice. The swap power can be used as an extended warp in many situations. The power will only work when the end destination is an object. If Zero is inside an object while swap is used, the destination object will be placed inside the original object. This causes the <b>internal</b> <b>object</b> to destroy the external object and take its place. This technique can be used to destroy objects/humans and create distractions.|$|E

40|$|Event synopsis: Ronald Fairbairn was {{the father}} of object {{relations}} theory, which now permeates modern psychoanalytic thought. He developed a distinctive psychology of dynamic structure that began with the infant’s need for relationships, and in which mental structure is based upon the relations between ego-structures and the <b>internal</b> <b>objects</b> that result from introjection and psychic modification of these early relationships. This conference will outline the basics of Fairbairn’s contribution, and then explore the ramification and development of these ideas to clinical work, and broadly to applications in modern psychoanalytic thinking...|$|R
