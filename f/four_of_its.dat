Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5December, when <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> aircraft {{were ordered to}} Darwin, Northern Territory, in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific. On 7December, this detachment established itself at Penfui, near Koepang in Dutch Timor, while No.2 Squadron's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby. The following day, aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese pearler Nanyo Maru, which was suspected of being a radio ship, and forced it aground. By 12December, Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base, as well as No.2 Squadron.|$|E

That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media {{was critical of}} Alston for playing Campanella; {{they said that the}} catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine.

Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E

On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters.
