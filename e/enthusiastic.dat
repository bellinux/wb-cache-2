5|$|Early episodes {{revealed}} Grissom to be a witty, <b>enthusiastic,</b> and quirky {{scientist who}} had some sense of humor. He flirted regularly {{and seemed to be}} constantly in a hyperactive state.|$|E
5|$|Fans were <b>enthusiastic</b> {{about winning}} the Central League, and {{repeated}} the celebratory leap into Dōtonbori Canal. However, {{instead of the}} individual leapers representing the players, over 5,300 fans plunged into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Julie Peters as Kaiya Ufgood, Willow's wife; {{a loving}} mother and <b>enthusiastic</b> {{in caring for}} Elora.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} a sticky bomb was delegated to the <b>enthusiastic</b> genius of Robert Stuart Macrae.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} was less <b>enthusiastic</b> elsewhere in Europe. Even in England some writers suggested other players, notably Buckle or von der Lasa, were stronger.|$|E
5|$|An <b>enthusiastic</b> horseman, Godley {{engaged in}} hunting and polo, {{becoming}} extremely proficient {{in the latter}} sport. He later played in the first international polo match between England and Argentina at the Hurlingham Club in Buenos Aires. To supplement his pay, he trained polo ponies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily {{newspapers}} were generally <b>enthusiastic</b> about Ved Vejen. It is now considered {{an important contribution to}} Danish literature, listed in the Danish Culture Canon. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow.|$|E
5|$|Britain was {{initially}} {{involved in the}} development of the metric system, and the US was among the 17 initial signatories of the Metre Convention in 1875. Yet in spite of <b>enthusiastic</b> support for the new system by intellectuals such as Charles Dickens, these two countries were particularly slow to implement it.|$|E
5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir. After witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an <b>enthusiastic</b> proponent of weather modification. Schaefer {{found that when}} he dumped crushed dry ice into a cloud, precipitation {{in the form of}} snow resulted.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was not as}} <b>enthusiastic</b> about a {{customs union}} as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff {{reciprocity}} provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine’s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication and what would eventually become the Organization of American States.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the less}} <b>enthusiastic</b> {{response}} The Flood garnered than its predecessor, the book still sold well. Soon after release, The Flood made the Publishers Weekly top ten bestsellers paperback list. The next {{book in the}} series, , would be written by Eric Nylund and {{bridge the gap between}} Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{officials}} and the public were <b>enthusiastic</b> about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared {{by many of the}} athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.|$|E
5|$|I've liked Tommy {{for a long}} time. He's clever, infectious, <b>enthusiastic</b> and a hard worker. He {{can play}} as a centre-forward, behind the centre-forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's {{going to be a}} great asset to us.|$|E
5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had {{lacked a}} {{constitution}} and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, and <b>enthusiastic</b> crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, {{and the provision}} of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did not make a nation.|$|E
5|$|In those days, Europe {{produced}} {{a great many}} child prodigies, inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso Jan Kubelík and formed by rigorous teaching and <b>enthusiastic</b> parents. The Hubay studio was no exception; Szigeti and his fellow wunderkinder performed extensively in special recitals and salon concerts during their study at the Liszt Academy.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not <b>enthusiastic</b> {{about being}} in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} <b>enthusiastic</b> artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used {{throughout}} his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His enormous correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister: Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned The Frighteners as a low-budget {{film with}} unknown actors, Zemeckis {{suggested}} casting his Back to the Future star Fox {{in the lead}} role. Fox became <b>enthusiastic</b> about working with Jackson when he saw Heavenly Creatures at the Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Ollivierre {{was born}} in St Vincent on 20 July 1876. His family were <b>enthusiastic</b> cricketers, {{although}} the region had little history within the sport, and his two younger brothers Richard and Helon went on to represent the West Indies in first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1933, Iraqi troops entered Mosul {{where they}} were given an <b>enthusiastic</b> {{reception}} by its Muslim inhabitants. Triumphant arches were erected and decorated with melons pierced with daggers, symbolising the heads of murdered Assyrians. The crown prince Ghazi himself came {{to the city to}} award 'victorious' colours to those military and tribal leaders who participated in the massacres and the looting.|$|E
5|$|Several critics however, {{were more}} <b>enthusiastic</b> about the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, he {{compared}} them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh {{due to their}} potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation.|$|E
5|$|Since Darwin was <b>enthusiastic</b> {{about the}} idea, Wallace asked the Entomological Society of London {{to test the}} hypothesis. In response, the {{entomologist}} John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his aviary, and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning coloration in animals.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Voss {{returned}} from leave, {{he was at}} odds with his squadron commander. He was detailed from his squadron to evaluate new fighter aircraft and became <b>enthusiastic</b> about the Fokker Triplane. After transferring through three temporary squadron commands in two months, Voss was given command of Jagdstaffel 10 on 30 July 1917 at Richthofen's request. By now, his victory total was 34.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second arrival to power, Tătărescu became noted for the <b>enthusiastic</b> support {{he gave to}} the modernist {{sculptor}} Constantin Brâncuși, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși's The Endless Column complex in Târgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).|$|E
5|$|The Canterbury Choral Society gives regular {{concerts in}} Canterbury Cathedral, specialising in the {{large-scale}} choral {{works of the}} classical repertory. The Canterbury Orchestra, founded in 1953, is a thriving group of <b>enthusiastic</b> players who regularly tackle major works from the symphonic repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} {{a wide range}} of reviews, from highly <b>enthusiastic</b> to harshly critical. The performances of the five songs covered were generally well-liked, though having four of them arranged as a series of auditions {{in the middle of the}} show met with disapproval. All five songs were released as singles, and three of them charted on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} chosen among 15 debut {{works for the}} 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It {{received}} <b>enthusiastic</b> reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival {{was surprised to see}} the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E
5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an <b>enthusiastic</b> baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion when he saw that the director Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very <b>enthusiastic</b> and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it became their second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more <b>enthusiastic</b> about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Union forces at Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Lincoln summoned McClellan from western Virginia, where McClellan had given the North the only engagements bearing a semblance of victory. He {{traveled}} by special train on the main Pennsylvania line from Wheeling through Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and on to Washington, D.C., and was greeted by <b>enthusiastic</b> crowds that met his train along the way.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most <b>enthusiastic</b> applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less <b>enthusiastic</b> than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not profitable.|$|E
5|$|Although his Parisian {{audience}} deserted him, Offenbach had by {{now become}} highly popular in England. John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre presented Offenbach's operettas to large and <b>enthusiastic</b> audiences. Between 1870 and 1872, the Gaiety produced 15 of his works. At the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte presented La Périchole in 1875. In Vienna, too, Offenbach works were regularly produced. While {{the war and}} its aftermath ravaged Paris, the composer supervised Viennese productions and travelled to England as the guest of the Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|American reviewers were <b>enthusiastic</b> of Deep Purple's live {{performances}} {{and the lack}} of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, {{to the point that they}} were often addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence in the United States, but renounced when they learned that the 21 year old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, and {{although}} reportedly very kind towards his students, had difficulty speaking to large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing chronologically backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more <b>enthusiastic</b> students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. Involving them in experimental archaeology, {{of which he was}} an early proponent, in 1937 he performed experiments to understand the vitrification process that had occurred at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.|$|E
