We ended up re-shooting the whole sequence." [...] One-use puppets appear in what Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivi√®re describes as [...] "a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21": in the opening scene, the characters of the NWAC executives present gaping mouths and teeth, complete with dental fillings, when Brains' plan to design an airship sends them into howls of laughter.

While Larry Hagman played the bad guy on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac.

Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Bj√∂rk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyonc√©-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman.

As a result, Paul Heyman, SmackDown!'s then-general manager, decided to punish Hardy vicariously for leaving his show by forcing Moore to face a series of much larger opponents. In successive weeks, Moore was squashed by Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, and The Big Show before unexpectedly defeating A-Train in an upset on the December 11 episode of SmackDown!, thus turning face. The following week, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar was scheduled to defend the championship against a wrestler chosen by a lottery machine, which produced Moore's name. After defeating Moore, Lesnar revealed that the process had been rigged, and Moore's name was on all the balls. Immediately afterward, Moore teamed with Hardcore Holly to defeat A-Train and Morgan, earning Holly a championship match against Lesnar.

Initially Moore was dominated by his much larger opponent, but a second Luchadore (the disguised Eddie Guerrero) took Moore's place, prompting Layfield to run away and giving Moore the victory by countout. Moore would start to drastically change his appearance by wearing red <b>eye</b> <b>shadow,</b> as well as new attire, and sporting a mohawk. Moore received a WWE Championship match on the December 30, 2004 episode of SmackDown, but was quickly defeated by JBL.
