Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be controversial.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Labrador Retrievers <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> {{have a high}} {{success rate}} at {{becoming}} guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|E
5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although {{only a fraction of}} this would come from renewable sources.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), {{it was the first}} in a series of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel The God Thing that he had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> {{be prone to}} failure. The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud {{in the course of}} winning the contract. The Achilles’ heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} expands on enumerative combinatorics, or the {{systematic}} numeration of objects. It {{was in this}} part {{that two of the}} most important of the twelvefold ways—the permutations and combinations that would form the basis of the subject—were fleshed out, though they had been introduced earlier for the purposes of probability theory. He gives the first non-inductive proof of the binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments. On a note more distantly related to combinatorics, the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E

5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E
