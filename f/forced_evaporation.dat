In warm climates, complete evaporation can take place, leaving only damp blast debris.

50|$|After the {{extraction}} and tea creaming processes, the tea solution {{is still too}} dilute to pass through a drier. Drying at this point would take too much capital for little gain, and any type of spray or freeze-drying would cause the resulting powder to have too low a density. The answer is to first concentrate the solution to what is usually 40% solids before drying, which involves the removal of water through evaporation. Concentration of tea is normally done through reduction of pressure. At high temperatures, the theaflavins in the solution are converted to thearubigins and carbohydrates caramelize. <b>Forced</b> <b>evaporation</b> systems had hot spots which led to undesirable sensory characteristics such as stewed and burnt flavors. Plate heat exchangers can cause the desired evaporation at around 45 °C, with short residence times that {{reduce the risk of}} thermal damage. This method can produce an extract with 45% solids. Aroma stripping is done prior to concentration, because those compounds run the risk of being lost during evaporation.|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} water use and {{electricity}} generation {{is very strong}} and largely omitted from the public policies aimed at sustainable generation of electricity. Electricity is required for treating and pumping water to its destination, and water is required for electricity generation at thermoelectric power plants for cooling purposes, and for the operation of environmental control devices that reduce air emissions. North Carolina is ranked 9 th in the United States for electricity total net production, according to the Energy Information Administration. Thermoelectric power freshwater withdrawals far outstrip all other water withdrawal categories; by the year 2000, thermoelectric power freshwater withdrawals were approaching 8, 000 million gallons per day, and as the population continues to grow in North Carolina, that number can only be expected to increase. They make {{some of the largest}} water withdrawals in the state of North Carolina, but they only consume approximately 3 % of the water they intake. The consumptive use percentage of 3 % is misleading because it doesn’t take into account <b>forced</b> <b>evaporation.</b> As mentioned previously, power plants require intake water to use for cooling purposes in the electricity generation process. The withdrawn cooling waters, once run through the plant, are returned to rivers/lakes at a higher temperature than the ambient water temperature. This higher temperature water causes additional evaporation (<b>forced</b> <b>evaporation)</b> from the river/lake. <b>Forced</b> <b>evaporation</b> should be of particular concern to North Carolina due to the severe droughts that have occurred in the region in recent history which threaten energy production as well as other water uses (ex. drinking water supply). In this project we find that <b>forced</b> <b>evaporation</b> represents an average 22 % increase in power plant water consumption in North Carolina, when compared to water consumption occurring during electricity generation on-site. We also look at the impact that air emission controls have on the plants water consumption.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} trapping and {{evaporative cooling}} of ultracold 87 Sr and 88 Sr mixtures in an optical dipole trap {{to produce the}} first Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 88 Sr. Furthermore, this work presents thermalization studies that characterize the scattering properties of these ultracold strontium samples. Such ultracold atomic gases have become an important area of research because of their potential for improving optical frequency standards and for realizing quantum computation using neutral atoms. A BEC of 88 Sr is particularly interesting because the small value of its background s-wave scattering length may enable the use of optical Feshbach resonances to create two-dimensional solitons. However, the small scattering length for 88 Sr also hinders efficient evaporative cooling in the optical dipole trap, a necessary step to producing a BEC. Experiments with other ultracold gases have successfully overcome this hurdle by mixing in a second atomic species which, by introducing stronger interactions with the weakly interacting species, enables evaporation to colder temperatures via sympathetic cooling. For this work, we use 87 Sr to sympathetically cool 88 Sr during <b>forced</b> <b>evaporation</b> to quantum degeneracy. Previous experiments in the Killian Lab characterized 88 Sr in detail. Here, I emphasize the new or improved aspects that have allowed trapping and cooling of the mixtures of 87 Sr and 88 Sr: trapping of 87 Sr by itself, spectroscopic measurements of all the stable strontium isotopes to guide the trapping of isotopic mixtures, imaging of both 87 Sr and 88 Sr, and the various trade-offs necessary to simultaneously trap 87 Sr and 88 Sr. Finally, I discuss how the thermalization studies of the scattering properties of the isotopes guide the <b>forced</b> <b>evaporation</b> of mixed isotope samples.
