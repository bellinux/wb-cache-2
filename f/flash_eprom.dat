50|$|Using the FGMOS as a {{programmable}} charge element, it {{is commonly}} used for non-volatile storage such as <b>flash,</b> <b>EPROM</b> and EEPROM memory. In this context, floating-gate MOSFETs are useful because of their ability to store an electrical charge for extended periods of time without a connection to a power supply. Other applications of the FGMOS are neuronal computational element in neural networks, analog storage element and e-pots.|$|E

The model requires as only input basic cell parameters and an oxide qualification obtained at the capacitor and transistor level. status: publishe...|$|E

5000|$|Solid-state media, such as <b>EPROMs,</b> <b>flash</b> {{memory and}} other {{solid-state}} drives, store data using electrical charges, which can slowly leak away due to imperfect insulation. The chip {{itself is not}} affected by this, so reprogramming it once per decade or so will prevent data decay. The biggest problem can be finding a clean copy of the master data from which the chip may be reprogrammed; frequently, {{by the time the}} user discovers the data decay, the master data may be lost.|$|R

Tested devices are n-MOSFET normally used for <b>Flash</b> <b>EPROM</b> applications with four different technologies for the tunnel oxide layer. Stresses have been performed at different source and drain bias conditions for a total injected charge up to 1 C/cm(2). The oxide characteristics and degradation have been determined comparing the MOSFET threshold voltage and transconductance peak for as received devices and after each stress step...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a measurement system {{for research on}} nonvolatile memories, such as <b>Flash,</b> <b>EPROM,</b> EEPROM. The instrument architecture {{is based on the}} PCI local bus, thus allowing a direct interface of the memory under test with the PC controlling the measurement. A rank of programmable waveform generators allows applying arbitrary signals to the memory cells during writing and reading, thus guaranteeing the flexibility required at the research level. The instrument performances have been evaluated on 4 MB test chips and results are comparable to those of commercial Automated Test Equipment. This instrument, besides the analysis of writing operations, can be successfully used to evaluate the evolution of such operations during memory cycling and their impact on long-term reliability...|$|E
40|$|An upward looking sonar instrument, the Ice Profiling Sonar (IPS), {{has been}} developed, and {{successfully}} used for obtaining time series measurements of ice keel depths over the continental shelves of the Arctic {{in support of}} scientific research. Since the winter of 1996 / 97, it has been extensively used {{off the coast of}} Sakhalin Island, Russian Federation, in support of offshore oil and gas research aimed at characterizing the seasonal sea-ice regime. The IPS instrument has now been modified to extend its capabilities to provide accurate measurement of ocean waves. The instrument uses a high frequency acoustic transducer (420 kHz). It has a very narrow conical beam (2 degrees width at- 3 dB) to minimize the spatial smoothing of surface waves across the sonar footprint. With reduced power consumption, and an expanded internal storage capacity of 64 Mbytes (<b>flash</b> <b>EPROM),</b> the new instrument is capable of continuous measurements of wave amplitude at a sampling rate of 1 Hz over deployments of up to nine months duration. During March to April 1998, an evaluation of the performance of the modified IPS instrument, through intercomparison with a wave-rider buoy, was conducted in open ocean conditions off the Pacific west coast. Instantaneous wave heights of up to 11. 5 m were measured. The results indicate good agreement between the measurements obtained from the IPS instrument and those measured using the wave-rider buoy. The subsea IPS instrument is very well suited to wave measurement in areas where sea ice or shipping are hazards to surface installations...|$|E
