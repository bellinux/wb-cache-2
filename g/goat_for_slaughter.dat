Both of these are sold in Midelt, but largely for local consumption. Locally gathered evidence indicates that the local price of meat is inversely related to rainfall: in wet years, nomads can keep their herds alive through the summer and do not bring them to market; in dry years, animals are better sold than lost to draught.|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} from November 2008 -April 2009 in Addis Ababa abattoir to overview the status of hydatidosis in small ruminants in the country. A total of 611 sheep and 389 <b>goats</b> brought <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> {{from different parts of}} the country were involved. Out of 1000 small ruminants examined 97 (9. 7 %) were found to harbor hydatid cysts. Infection was significantly higher (p 0. 05). Out of 111 hydatid cysts recovered for laboratory observation, 52. 25 % were fertile while 28. 83 and 18. 92 % were sterile and calcified, respectively. About 54 % of the cysts from sheep were fertile while it was 33. 33 % <b>for</b> <b>goats.</b> Such an observation of a higher prevalence and fertile cysts in sheep compared to goats may suggest the enormous role that sheep could play in the occurrence of hydatidosis. Inline with this finding, the need for proper disposal of offal, termination of backyard slaughter and control of stray dogs is recommended to prevent the economic loss and public health hazards associated with the disease...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, many {{zoonotic}} diseases have emerged with serious negative consequences on humans. In {{the light of}} this, ante-mortem inspections were conducted, using body condition scoring to assess the health status of livestock presenting <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> and to identify issues relating to meat inspection in four purposively selected government approved abattoirs in Benue State, Nigeria. The result of our assessment showed that 5. 0 % of the cattle and <b>goats</b> presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> during the investigation period were highly emaciated animals with a prevalence range of 0. 0 – 12. 1 % with variance between abattoirs, whereas 37. 9 % were moderately emaciated and 57. 2 % had good body condition. Extreme emaciation was higher in cattle (6. 7 %) compared to the goats (3. 2 %). The moderately high prevalence of emaciated animals {{intended for human consumption}} coupled with unorganized and inappropriate meat inspection in the studied abattoirs has serious public health implications. To prevent consumers from contacting {{zoonotic diseases}}, education of butchers and traders is necessary for thorough and effective inspections. In addition, animal traders should be encouraged to seek veterinary assistance for their sick animals. Meat inspectors should treat all emaciated animals as suspects, as emaciation could be a cause from underlying health problems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTWe {{determined}} the reproductive parameters and clinical disorders in pregnant goats infected and reinfected with Toxoplasma gondii, and posteriorly {{the loss of}} gross revenue due to congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated. Of the 25 non-pregnant females negative for T. gondii, 20 were orally inoculated (ME 49 strain) and of these, 15 pregnant females chronically infected were orally reinoculated (VEG strain) with T. gondii oocysts. Five groups were formed (n= 5) : GI, GII and GIII (reinoculations at 40, 80 and 120 days of gestation, respectively), GIV (inoculation) and GV (no inoculation). Clinical and serological exams were performed on days 0 (prior to inoculation), 3, 6 9, 15 and 21 and every 7 days post-inoculation. Exams were also performed on day 3 and every 7 days post-reinoculation. Reproductive management was performed on all females and initiated when the females infected displayed IgG titers IFAT< 1, 024. From the average prolificacy indexes of each experimental group were estimated: total production of kilograms of live weight (total kg LW) of <b>goats</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> gross revenue and loss of gross revenue in U. S. dollars (US$), designed for a herd of 1, 000 matrices. The unviable prolificacy indexes were 0. 8 (GI), 1. 2 (GII) and 0. 2 (GIII). Clinical disorders affected 57. 1 % (GI), 75. 0 % (GII) and 16. 7 % (GIII) of the offspring of goats reinfected with T. gondii. Congenital toxoplasmosis in goats reinfected resulted {{in the loss of}} 26. 5 % of gross revenues, being GI (US$ 10, 577. 60 or 57. 1 %) and GII (US$ 12, 693. 12 or 60 %) holders of the highest values and percentages of economic losses. It was found that congenital toxoplasmosis reinfection cause clinical disorders in goats chronically infected with T. gondii and their offspring with birth of unviable animals and loss of gross revenue, at different stages of pregnancy (40, 80 and 120 days of gestation), being in the initial and intermediate stages of pregnancy the largest estimates of these losses...|$|R
40|$|Th is paper {{examines}} young people’s socialization {{into the}} doctrine known as “dominionism,” which justifi es {{the use of}} animals {{in the service of}} human beings. Using qualitative research, it focuses on the 4 -H youth livestock program, in which boys and girls raise cattle, pigs, <b>goats,</b> and sheep <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Th e analysis portrays 4 -H as an apprenticeship in which children learn to do cognitive emotion work, use distancing mechanisms, and create a “redemption ” narrative to cope with contradictory ethical and emotional experiences. Although this paper focuses on young people’s relationships with animals, and particularly with types of animals that have received little scholarly attention, the conclusions have implications for understanding the repro-duction of inequalities, more generally. An understanding of the means through which people learn to justify the treatment of the animals known as “livestock ” can shed light on the mecha-nisms involved in generic processes of inequality.

40|$|A single daily oral dose of {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) — a tannin-binding agent — {{has been shown}} to substantially improve feed intake and efficiency of utilization by sheep and goats consuming tannin-rich forage. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the effect of supplementing 10 g/day of PEG on the performance of does grazing on Mediterranean woodland and scrubland. The experiments were carried out in production systems based on Mamber <b>goats</b> raised only <b>for</b> the production of slaughter kids (Experiment 1), dual-purpose Mamber <b>goats</b> raised <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> kids and milk (Experiment 2) or DamascusAnglo-Nubian <b>goats</b> raised mainly <b>for</b> milk (Experiment 3). In Mamber goats, PEG supplementation was associated with higher body weight (BW) gain during pregnancy (p< 0. 01), higher kid birth-weight (p< 0. 05) and daily BW gain until weaning (p< 0. 10 and p< 0. 05 in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively), and no difference in milk yield. In contrast, the response of DamascusAnglo-Nubian goats to PEG was a 43 % increase in milk yield (p< 0. 001) but no response in kid weight at birth. These responses are consistent with previous findings that show the resilience of Mamber goats to practices aimed at increasing their milk production while these goats respond well to practices that improve the probability of successful reproduction in harsh environments. In contrast, DamascusAnglo-Nubians respond to increased available nutrients by increasing their milk production. Supplementation with PEG has the potential to improve the profitability of systems in which liberally supplemented and high-yielding dairy goats feed on Mediterranean browse. However, its contribution to production systems exploiting well adapted but low-yielding local goats is limited. # 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|The South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries {{estimated}} in 2012 {{that there were}} 2. 033 million goats in the country. Of these animals, less than 0. 5 % are slaughtered at registered abattoirs. Although informal and traditional <b>slaughter</b> of <b>goats</b> <b>for</b> home consumption is permitted under the South African Meat Safety Act 40 of 2000, the responsibility for ensuring that products are safe is left to the traditional or ritual slaughter practitioners. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess whether preslaughter activities associated with traditional or ritual slaughter promote or reduce food-associated risks and to recommend mitigation strategies for potential food safety hazards. Structured interviews were conducted with 105 selected respondents (in and around Tshwane, South Africa) who had been involved in traditional goat slaughter. Approximately 70 % of goats slaughtered were obtained from sources that could be traced to ascertain the origin of the goats. None of the respondents were aware of the need for a health declaration <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> stock. Some slaughter practitioners (21 %) perform prepurchase inspection of stock to ascertain their health status. However, this percentage is very small, and the approach is based on indigenous knowledge systems. The majority of respondents (67. 6 %) travelled 1 to 11 km to obtain a <b>goat</b> <b>for</b> traditional <b>slaughter.</b> Although approximately 70 % of slaughter goats were transported by vehicles, the vehicles used did not meet the legal standard. More than two-thirds of goats were tied to a tree while waiting to be slaughtered, and the rest were held in a kraal. The holding period ranged from 1 to 72 h, but more than 70 % of the animals were slaughtered within 36 h. This study revealed that traditional and ritual slaughter involves some preslaughter activities with potential to mitigate the risk of slaughtering animals that are not fit for human consumption. Such activities include prepurchase inspection, obtaining goats from known and traceable sources, and ensuring that animals have sufficient rest before slaughter. However, given the rudimentary nature of these activities, they may not offer adequate protection to consumers of such meat. The lack of understanding of the importance of a obtaining a health declaration certificate and minimizing stress in animals waiting to be slaughtered should be addressed to minimize the potential for propagation of foodborne diseases. The Meat Safety Act 40 of 2000 should be enforced where it applies and should be reviewed to provide guidelines that would help mitigate human health risks associated with traditional slaughter of goats.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Addis Ababa Municipal Abattoir Enterprises (AAMAE) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia with the following objectives: 1) to assess the health status of sheep and <b>goats</b> presented <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> to AAMAE, 2) to identify the most common causes of organ and carcass condemnation in sheep and goats slaughtered at AAMAE, and 3) to estimate the magnitude of direct economic loss attributed to the condemnation of organs and carcasses at AAMAE. A cross-sectional study which involved both ante-mortem and post-mortem examinations was conducted on 768 small ruminants (384 sheep and 384 goats) from January 2014 to July 2014. Study animals were selected through systematic random sampling. During ante-mortem examination, skin disorders, poor body condition, and respiratory disorders were the most common abnormalities encountered. Postmortem examination revealed that 5 (0. 7 %) hearts, 233 (30 %) lungs, 264 (34 %) livers, 4 (0. 5 %) kidneys and 2 (2 %) carcasses were condemned due to various causes. Pericarditis and hydropericardium were the causes of heart rejection. The main causes of lung condemnation were pneumonia and hydatid cysts. Fasciolosis was {{the main cause of}} liver condemnation followed by hepatitis and hydatid cysts. The causes of kidney condemnation were nephritis, hemorrhage and calcification. Bruising was the only cause of carcass condemnation. The overall direct financial loss from organs and carcass condemnation was estimated to be 1, 077, 000 Ethiopian birr (ETB) or approximately 55, 000 USD per annum. In conclusion, results indicated that a significant amount of revenue is lost due to carcass condemnation, and highlighted the need for strategic disease control programs, particularly for parasitic diseases...|$|R
30|$|The {{communal}} pastoral {{system in}} Botswana {{needs to be}} acknowledged as a self-sustaining livelihood strategy in supposedly marginal land, complete with its own ecological, biological and social dynamics. Once this is recognized, then policies which continuously strive to ‘rescue’ and ‘modernize’ pastoral communities will be reconsidered. For example, current policy will push for some form of exclusion (fencing) when confronted with the preceding challenges in the study areas such as stray animals, livestock predation, stock theft, involvement of livestock in road accidents, livestock diseases and uncontrolled breeding. This strategy, however, will play right {{into the hands of}} proponents of fencing of the commons. Instead, policy should ‘think beyond the fence’ and lobby for the resuscitation of traditional natural resource management institutions at the local level, with more jurisdictions over land use. Also, to avoid the continued underestimation of the importance of livestock in national statistics, the capture of field data should also be modified to include non-monetary uses of livestock at the local level, such as animals used in paying bride price (bogadi) or <b>goats</b> <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> home consumption or social events.|$|R

40|$|Background: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite that infects {{humans and}} {{a broad spectrum of}} warm-blooded vertebrates. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of isolation and determining the genotypes of T. gondii strains from sheep and goats slaughtered in East and West Shewa Zones of Oromia Regional State, Central Ethiopia. Methods: Hearts of 47 sheep and 44 goats that were seropositive in the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) were bioassayed in mice. A multiplex PCR assay with 15 microsatellite markers was employed for genotyping of T. gondii isolates from sheep and goats. Results: Viable T. gondii were isolated from 47 (51. 65 %) animals, 27 sheep and 20 goats. Most isolates caused sub-clinical infections in mice, however, 2 sheep and 1 goat isolates were mouse-virulent, killing mice between 19 - 27 days post-inoculation. The success of T. gondii isolation in mice increased significantly (P = 0. 0001) with higher DAT antibody titers in sheep and goats. Genotyping revealed that 29 (87. 88 %) of the 33 isolates were Type II, 3 (9. 09 %) were Type III and 1 (3. 03 %) was atypical. Three strains (one type II, one type III, and the atypical genotype) were virulent for mice. Conclusions: T. gondii tissue cysts in sheep and <b>goats</b> <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> human consumption are widespread.
