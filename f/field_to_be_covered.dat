40|$|The {{large number}} of {{different}} types of examinations along with the notable broadness of scientific <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> present a strong challenge for all academic institutions. So far, many eLearning environments offering electronic examination tools face a severe problem in their acceptance through the academic community since their evaluation methods <b>are</b> usually restricted <b>to</b> simple mechanisms such as multiple choice, short-answer, gap-filling exercises etc. Yet, at higher levels of education, examinations usually contain problems which require deep analytical understanding. Here, the answers have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given by a freely phrased text, by a detailed diagram with annotations or by a (mathematical) proof with explanatory intermediate steps. Tablet PCs hold a large potential to overcome these problems: Their ability to deal with handwritten texts, sketches, diagrams, and pictures, enables a new type of “hybrid examinations”, combining the advantages of the new media with long-established and well proven examination procedures.

The Arecibo Galaxy Environments Survey (AGES) is a 2000 -hour neutral {{hydrogen}} (Hi) survey {{using the}} new Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) multibeam instrument at Arecibo Observatory†. It will cover 200 square degrees of sky, sampling a range of environments from the Local Void through to the Virgo Cluster with higher sensitivity, spatial resolution and velocity resolution than previous neutral hydrogen surveys. The first <b>field</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered,</b> 5 square degrees centred on the optically-isolated galaxy NGC 1156, has revealed two possible new companions to NGC 1156, one {{of which may be}} interacting with the galaxy.

40|$|The {{raising of}} fat lambs is not {{restricted}} to any particular system of farming, but limitations are imposed by many physical factors, the major ones being soil, climate, topography, and transport facilities. The aim {{of this investigation was}} directed towards obtaining information on; (a) the cost of producing rape, (b) the productive value or gross returns from rape as a fat lamb producer, and (c) the profit or loss on the rape crop when grazed by fattening lambs. The investigations reviewed the importance of rape as a fattening crop and the circumstances under which it is grown. It appears that rape will continue to be grown in the drier areas of the Dominion. It need not be considered essential in the maintenance of soil fertility, but it fits in well with the organisation of labour on cropping farms. The cost of growing the rape crop and the gross returns are influenced by numerous factors, many of which are outside the farmer’s control. The profit from the crop in those cases where store lambs are bought and fattened is governed mainly by the rape yield and the price of store lambs. Under average conditions for farmers to make a profit by buying store lambs and fattening them on rape, there is a tendency for the prices of store lambs to be too high. Finally, investigation has shown that the <b>field</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> is very complex, conditions varying with the efficiency of the farmer, with soil, weather, crop yield and breed of lamb {{as well as with the}} margin between store and fat lamb prices. Another factor, more difficult to measure, is the benefit obtained from rape in the general crop rotation and farm management...|$|E

40|$|The ETI is a {{non-profit}} organization set up in 1990 {{with the aim of}} concentrating and distributing diversity of information by means of multimedia computer technology. ETI has developed a user-friendly universal biodiversity software programme, Linnaeus 11, that allows specialists to store species information in text, pictures, videos and sounds in a standard exchangeable format using their own PCs. More importantly, this shell allows the construction of 'smart' identification systems giving specialists and non-specialists fast access to species information and identification. The Linnaeus 11 system <b>is</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used on relatively simple Macintosh and Windows PCs. It allows the user to concentrate on the science of the programme instead of the 'how to'. To build biodiversity databases ETI works with institutions such as UNESCO, to set-up and support both regional and international networks of specialists who use Linnaeus 11 software for local database building. Also ETI cooperates with international organizations like UNEP, FAO, WCMC and natural history museums that hold large biodiversity data collections. Specialists using the software send back entered species data on a yearly basis. At ETI the data are compiled and submitted to a review procedure similar to that used by scientific journals. Completed sets (on a particular taxonomic group or geographical area) are disseminated on CD-ROMs. At present ETI works with about one thousand specialists from all over the world. In 1994 ETI will release six interactive multimedia titles on marine biology, including Fishes of the N E Atlantic and Mediterranean, Pelagic mollusks of the world, and Marine lobsters of the world Other <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in future titles are: fungi; yeast; timber trees; and regional data sets.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the alleged {{destructive}} influence of the purse seine industry on the supply of fish in southern California waters has been much discussed among professional fishermen, as well as among other persons interested in our sea fisheries and their future. Articles {{to the effect that}} aliens were destroying the natural supply of fish in this region by means of purse seines have been published repeatedly in the newspapers. To quote from one of these articles: "For many of them [the purse seiners] nothing is more pleasing than to enrich themselves at our expense and risk. " The most serious complaint against the purse seine fishermen is that, by killing small barracuda in enormous quantities, they are depleting this fish. Another serious complaint is that these men unsettle the market conditions by landing very large individual catches. There is a rather widespread opinion that purse seining for barracuda, white sea bass, and yellowtail should be prohibited in southern California. Even though it is evident that the complaints are based mainly on hearsay and only to a very little extent on personal and more or less systematic observations, they are too serious to be disregarded. In order to establish the most important facts of the "purse seine problem," the California Fish and Game Commission undertook a preliminary investigation. This was entrusted to me, {{as a member of the}} staff of the California State Fisheries Laboratory, and was begun in May, 1922. The present paper is the immediate result of this investigation. The special problems to be examined were as follows: 1. The present economic condition of the purse seine industry. 2. The importance of the purse seiners as a source of supply to canneries and fresh fish markets. 3. The effect of purse seine fishing on the natural supply of fish, with special regard to the barracuda. 4. The possibilities and results of prohibitive or restrictive legislation against the purse seiners. The <b>field</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> was very extensive and the time at my disposal, for several reasons, very limited. These circumstances, unfortunately, made it necessary to treat several phases of the subject in a very summary way; and others have had to be totally or almost entirely disregarded, for instance, the description of the purse seine boats and of the fishing operations, and problems bearing on the life history of the species involved. In order to study the fishing operations and the effect of purse seining on the natural supply of fish, I made several trips with different purse seine and gill net boats during six weeks in May and June, 1922. The rest of the time used for the investigation was spent mostly in analyzing the statistical data bearing on the purse seine problem which previously had been collected by the Fish and Game Commission. The intention was to analyze data covering a whole year, but lack of time made it necessary to confine the analysis to data extending over a period of six months. The period chosen was January 1 to July 1, 1922. The term "purse seine boat" has been used in the restricted sense commonly accepted in southern California; i. e., it refers to rather large boats, generally of between twenty-four and forty-two gross tons, furnished with turntables, on which the seine is piled, and purse seines of the type described in the appendix to this report. In the analysis, differentiation has been made between purse seine boats and "small boats. " A further classification, according to gear, of the small boats, which, of course, would have been highly desirable, was not possible, since necessary data were lacking. The statistical data for the years preceding 1922 and used in this report are not based on the records published in the quarterly magazine, CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME, but on revised, unpublished figures from the Commission's archives...|$|E
40|$|Processes of {{evaluation}} of crop varieties {{for inclusion in}} a recommended list are {{based on data from}} series of field experiments conducted at a number of locations (sites) and possibly over several years. Such series of variety trials are called multi-environment variety trials (METs). There exist an immense literature on transforming MET data into information useful for breeders and crop evaluators. It reflects different approaches to the statistical analysis of such data. Going back to the origins, it may <b>be</b> interesting <b>to</b> recall the approach of Yates and Cochran (1938, Section 2) who indicated that although “it <b>is</b> usually impossible <b>to</b> secure a set of sites selected entirely at random”, it <b>is</b> advisable <b>to</b> proceed {{in such a way that}} the experimental fields actually used in the trials could be considered as “representative ” for “all <b>fields</b> which <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by the subsequent recommendations”. This approach has been adopted by organizers of variety trials in many countries. Hence, when modelling the analysis of MET data, a mixed model is usually adopted (see the overview by Denis, Piepho, and van Eeuwijk, 1997; Smith, Cullis, and Thompson, 2005). In deriving a mixed model for such analysis various assumptions related <b>to</b> METs <b>are</b> usually made. They have to take into account that in these trials (a) “the varieties are individual...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of glycerol are {{investigated by}} dynamic light scattering (DLS) {{over the whole}} concentration range (10 - 98 wt. % water) and in the temperature range 283 - 303 K. The measurements reveal one slow relaxation process in the geometry of polarized light scattering.

The relaxation time of the observed process exhibits a 1 /q(2) dependence, proving that it <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> long-range translational diffusion. The Stokes-Einstein relation <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> estimate the hydrodynamic radius of the diffusing particles and from these calculations it is evident that the observed relaxation process <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> the Brownian motion of single or a few glycerol molecules.

40|$|The {{remote sensing}} study of vegetated {{regions of the}} world has {{typically}} been focused on the use of broad-band vegetation indices such as NDVI. Various modifications of these indices have been developed in attempts to minimize the effect of soil background, e. g., SAVI, or to reduce the effect of the atmosphere, e. g., ARVI. Most of these indices depend on the so-called 'red edge,' the sharp transition between the strong absorption of chlorophyll pigment in visible wavelengths and the strong scattering in the near-infrared from the cellular structure of leaves. These broadband indices tend to become highly inaccurate as the green canopy cover becomes sparse. The advent of high spectral resolution remote sensing instrument such as the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) has allowed the detection of narrow spectral features in vegetation and there are reports of detection of the red edge even for pixels with very low levels of green vegetation cover by Vane et al. and Elvidge et al., and to characterize algal biomass in coastal areas. Spectral mixing approaches similar to those of Smith et al. can be extended into the high spectral resolution domain allowing for the analysis of more endmembers, and potentially, discrimination between material with narrow spectral differences. Vegetation in arid regions tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sparse, often with small leaves such as the creosote bush. Many types of arid region vegetation spend much of the year with their leaves in a senescent state, i. e., yellow, with lowered chlorophyll pigmentation. The sparseness of the leaves of many arid region plants has the dual effect of lowering the green leaf area which can be observed and of allowing more of the sub-shrub soil <b>to</b> <b>be</b> visible which further complicates the spectrum of a region covered with arid region vegetation. Elvidge examined the spectral characteristics of dry plant materials showing significant differences in the region of the red edge and the diagnostic ligno-cellulose absorptions at 2090 nm and 2300 nm. Ray et al. detected absorption at 2100 nm in AVIRIS spectra of an abandoned <b>field</b> known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by a great deal of dead plant litter. In order to better study arid region vegetation remote sensing data, it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> better characterize the reflectance spectra of in situ, living, arid region plants...|$|R
