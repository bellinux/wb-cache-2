5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction <b>is</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner.

The school offers French, Spanish and German as foreign languages and, in Year 8, pupils take a second language to supplement the one studied in Year 7.

5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction.

5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes <b>is</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the initial management.

Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E

5|$|Innis's {{theories}} of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: {{he had a}} profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change.

5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life.

However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E

MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology <b>is</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|While anti-statism <b>is</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> {{all forms}} of anarchism, some schools of anarchism also oppose other forms of {{authority}} {{in the conduct of}} human relations. Anarchism is compatible with various economic systems, and there are capitalist, geoist, mutualist, and socialist forms. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity <b>is</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light.
