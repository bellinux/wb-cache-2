25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> hard to take them out of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> because I said I was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E

I took these people to dinner and begged. I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly really thinking was, 'This woman is an idiot.'" [...] Rhimes also explains why {{it took so long}} to produce this episode: [...] The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of [...] "The Story" [...] is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona. Capshaw assessed that, [...] "The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each other’s lives. They come to care, I think, for one another." ...|$|E
500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. [...] Two of Bagwell's closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. [...] Said Ausmus, [...] "He was the quintessential teammate. [...] He was a superstar who always put the team before himself. [...] And between he and Bidge (Biggio), they always {{shouldered}} the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won." [...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. [...] <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Tallulah Bankhead had {{received}} critical acclaim for her {{performance in the}} 1939 Broadway production of Hellman's play, but director William Wyler, who previously had teamed with Bette Davis on Jezebel and The Letter, insisted on casting her in the lead role instead. Producer Samuel Goldwyn agreed, since none of Bankhead's films had been box office hits. (Coincidentally, Davis had recreated on film another of Bankhead's Broadway roles, Judith Traherne in Dark Victory.) However, Davis was reluctant, [...] "On The Little Foxes <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> the producer, Samuel Goldwyn, to let Tallulah Bankhead play Regina because Tallulah was magnificent on the stage. He wouldn't let her." [...] Initially Jack L. Warner refused to lend Davis to Goldwyn, who then offered the role to Miriam Hopkins. When Wyler refused to work with her, Goldwyn resumed negotiations with Warner and finally secured Davis for $385,000. As a contract player at Warner Bros., Davis was earning $3,000 a week, and when she discovered how much Warner {{had received}} for her appearance in Foxes, she demanded and ultimately received {{a share of the}} payment.|$|E

2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they {{gave me the opportunity}} to walk I took it. I was no longer interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown four times a week and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. I admit that had <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> the producers to let me stay this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But I was happy to go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E
