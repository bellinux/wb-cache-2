5000|$|The Iu Mien {{people were}} the first civilization in China {{according}} to the chanting song story, Iu Mien Elders verbally story, a shaman’s worship book written by Iu Mien elders in ancient Chinese characters. The Iu Mien nation was located {{in the southern part}} of China today known as Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan provinces and was ruled by the king of the Iu Mien people. The last Iu Mien King was <b>King</b> <b>Pan,</b> as know by today’s last names: Saephanh, Saephan, Phanh, Pharn, Pan, Pham, etc. <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and the Chinese emperor declared war against each other 800 years ago over disputed territory. Iu Mien, led by <b>King</b> <b>Pan,</b> were fighting to protect their people and their territory. <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and Iu Mien lost tremendously. <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> had lost countless soldiers and civilian casualties as well as territory to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor had captured most of the Iu Mien’s territory. Iu Mien and <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> were unable to fight due to outnumbered soldiers and weapons, which forced <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> to negotiate with the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor had given two options to <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and Iu Mien people: 1) Surrender to the Chinese emperor and sign a treaty to give all territorial land to the Chinese emperor, or 2) <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> can continue to fight, but the Chinese determine that they can genocide and wipe out Iu Mien society in a short period. <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and his government chose to give up all territories to China and signed the treaty called “Passport to travel in the hill” or “Passport to cross the mountain.” This document pertained relevant information. The Chinese emperor had written this document in Chinese character, as the following stated “Iu Mien people have rights to maintain their identity, language, culture, and worship system and live on the hill side or in the mountain to cultivate land for farming and crops and raise their family. The Iu Mien would not be allowed to form their own government and have no rights to pursue their own nation. Iu Mien, who possesses this document, has the legal rights to cross any territories/ borders to settle and to build their village in the hill/mountain to make a living by farming without delaying by any regional governments. The governments of that country are responsible for their wellbeing and educating them to follow the rules of laws of the country that Iu Mien are living in.” ...|$|E

5000|$|New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther <b>panned</b> <b>Kings</b> Row, which he {{described}} as being as [...] "gloomy and ponderous" [...] as the novel upon which it was based. [...] "Just why the Warners attempted a picture of this sort in these times, and just why the corps of high-priced artists which they employed for it did such a bungling job," [...] Crowther wrote, [...] "are questions which they are probably mulling more anxiously than any one else." [...] Crowther said that the film [...] "turgidly unfolds on the screen," [...] and is [...] "one of the bulkiest blunders {{to come out of}} Hollywood in some time." [...] The performances, particularly Cummings', were, he said, [...] "totally lacking in conviction." [...] The film, he said, [...] "just shows a lot of people feeling bad." ...|$|R

50|$|After {{losing his}} nation to China, <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> {{had created a}} new worship system by {{worshiping}} ancestor spirit and a universal god. Due to no permanent place to build temples, <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and the shaman/priest had formed art-posters consisting of the universal gods including three brothers of Celestials and many universal spirit gods. These poster images can be easily carried when they moved from mountain to mountain without interrupting worshiping. All shaman spiritual books start with <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> as {{a founder of the}} religion and creator. The most important aspect of Iu Mien ancestor worship is when a person died. When a family member who has died, they will host a ceremony. Iu Mien people believe a deceased person has two types of spirit/soul. The good and bad spirits that need to be properly send to certain place. The Iu Mien priest/shaman will perform a ceremony to guide the deceased soul/spirit to the spirit world. The good spirit will be worship by his/her children and it can help protect family from harm and bless family in many means. The bad spirit will be sent to hell and locked away so it {{will not be able to}} come back to haunt family members. The priests/shamans perform a ceremony of chanting 2-3 days in order to wrap up and complete the deceased spirit and soul and guide each spirit/soul to the right destination of the spirit world so that evil spirit doesn’t comes back to haunt family members. The deceased's good spirit/soul becomes heavenly being and looks after his/her surviving family members on a daily basis.|$|E

50|$|From time to time, {{family members}} {{will offer a}} chicken and joss paper money to the deceased’s good spirit to ask for guiding and {{protection}} from harm. In other times, family members dream or have nightmares about the deceased family member. That means the deceased spirit/soul needs help by their living family member so the ancestor god will send a message by dreaming. In the other occasion, ancestor gods will send strange things such as making bird fly into Iu Mien house. If this signal is received by family member, the ceremony will take place. By offering chicken and joss paper, the spirit world will gain wealth. In return, god spirit will help human world to gain all kinds of well-being. Such as a family’s business will gain profit, working person will get paid raised, students have creative ideas to concentrate on study, a person feel sad without a reason will gain strength and confident. Ill person will gain energy and get heal/well. Each deceased person get three times ceremony during his/her children’s life time, the spirit/soul become heaven god and has more power to {{take good care of}} his/her children and grandchildren. When Iu Mien priests/shaman chanting, they start to tell a story of how <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> created society, the priest/shaman laminated from the <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> and called King Pan’s spirit/soul to bless so that the priest has more power to perform the ceremony well. <b>King</b> <b>Pan</b> was a head of religion and the head of state when he was a King. Even today, Iu Mien people still believe his spirit/soul has power to deal with spirit world and human world for many good reasons. (Religion story telling by Saeng Fou Orn Saephanh, grand priest/Shaman).|$|E
