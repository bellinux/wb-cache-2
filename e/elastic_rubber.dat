25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber,</b> optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} model for {{dynamics}} of entangled networks made up of linear chains with many temporary cross-links. At times shorter than the lifetime of a cross-link such networks behave as <b>elastic</b> <b>rubbers</b> (gels). On longer time scales the successive breaking {{of only a few}} cross-links allows the chain to diffuse along its confining tube. The motion of a chain in this hindered reptation model is controlled by the concentration and lifetime of tie points. We calculate the self-diffusion coefficient and discuss the stress relaxation in terms of molecular parameters, including the chain length, the number of cross-linking groups per chain, and the lifetime and probability of formation of cross-links. We find good agreement with recent experiments by Stadler et al. on model thermoplastic elastomers. 1...|$|R

One or two circular <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> bands were sutured under mean tension at the opposite edges of 22 large wounds located in different body sites. These rubber strips were replaced when they were broken or re-fixed when they have lost their tension until the complete closure of the wounds. Complete closure was achieved without any other surgical procedure or device in 21 wounds and one wound reduced its dimensions. No major complication due to this treatment was verified. The synthesis of large wounds with <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> bands kept under mean tension is a simple, efficacious and inexpensive surgical option that may be useful for treatment in several circumstances.

30|$|We {{have shown}} that adding a small volume change to {{classical}} <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> models can aid in analytical and numerical simulations of polymer structures. <b>Rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> models with volume change, when incorporated in finite element codes, remove the need for special elements. Such models reduce naturally {{to the case of}} infinite bulk modulus, and allow a smooth progression from compressible to incompressible materials. Simulations using various <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> models showed that allowing volume changes improves the numerical stability and affects the accuracy of numerical predictions. Model modifications discussed in the paper help to reduce numerical difficulties and readily allow the determination of the source of the instabilities. The analysis of stable non-round shapes of twisted O-ring (elastic instability) became numerically stable only after implementing a compressible material model (i.e., the numerical instability is removed).|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, an <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber</b> or 'Pirelli' webbing became popular. This is made {{of black}} rubber, with an {{internal}} canvas reinforcement. This webbing is applied by hand and is not tensioned, the elasticity of the rubber being sufficient. It is attached by metal clips, fitting into grooves in the frame. As the webbing is elastic it is only used in parallel strips, rather than being interweaved: friction between these elastic webs moving over each other would soon abrade their edges.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{conventional}} valves such as ball valves, piston valves or {{gate valves}} tend to fail when in process with the above-mentioned aggressive products. The {{reason is that}} the valve body seat or the gate/piston of the valves wears out too quickly and the valve can no longer shut off tightly, whereas air-operated pinch valves work without almost any wear of the <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber</b> hose because the kinetic energy of the solids are absorbed through the extremely high elasticity of the rubber that also helps to resist abrasion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cartridge}} and <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber</b> protrusion type detents {{are primarily}} used for open bolt markers, or on closed bolt markers to prevent double feeding (feeding {{more than one}} ball when the bolt is open for loading). Closed bolt markers generally use the constriction method to prevent [...] "roll outs". A roll out is a frustrating malfunction where the ball completely rolls out of the barrel, causing no paintball to be fired when the trigger is pulled. A partial roll out is when the ball rolls partially through the barrel, causing reduced velocity.|$|E

30|$|Simulations using various <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> models {{showed that}} {{allowing}} volume changes improves the numerical stability.

We observed that most of the ‘failure to converge’ results in <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> simulations are due to numerical instabilities. Our model modification helps to reduce numerical difficulties and allows modelers to readily determine the source of the instabilities. We also showed that the modified Aruda-Boyce material model is more accurate than generalized Mooney or Ogden models in stress-strain and stability prediction.|$|R

5000|$|Traditional metal wired braces are {{stainless-steel}} and {{are sometimes}} used {{in combination with}} titanium. Traditional metal braces {{are the most common}} type of braces. These braces have a metal bracket with <b>elastic</b> (<b>rubber</b> band) ties holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of braces are self-ligating braces that do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of braces, treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional braces.|$|E
50|$|Air-operated pinch valves {{generally}} only {{consist of}} an extremely elasticised reinforced rubber hose, {{a type of}} housing, and two socket end covers or flanges. The rubber hoses of the air operated pinch valves are usually press-fitted and centred into the housing ends by the socket end covers or flange.Since they function without any additional actuators, all they need to close or operate is a pressurized air supply into the valve body. As soon as the air supply becomes interrupted and the volume of air exhausts, the <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber</b> hose starts to open due to {{the force of the}} process flow.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hydro Power" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Buzz Bee Toys Inc., {{referring}} initially to their series of water guns that employed an <b>elastic</b> <b>rubber</b> bladder to pressurize water. Akin to the CPS system, the rubber diaphragm system can be considered basically half of a CPS-pressure chamber. A sheet of elastic material (typically rubber) is clamped against a housing unit. Water is pumped into the chamber, expanding the bladder that pressurizes the water within. However, due {{to the shape of}} the bladder, its expansion is not as uniform as in the CPS system, thus it experiences more significant pressure dropoff as the pressure chamber empties.|$|E

30|$|To explain {{mechanical}} {{behaviors of}} hydrogels, <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> theory {{is regarded as}} the most efficient approach, because it associates important bulk property of hydrogels: rubbery modulus scales, temperature, and crosslinking density (De Gennes 1979; Flory and Rehner 1943; James and Guth 1943; Wall 1942). Hydrogels show elastic property like rubber; however, original rubber theory cannot properly explain the nature of hydrogels in aqueous medium and demands some modifications (Chai et al. 2017). Later, Peppas et al. (2000) developed an Eq. (2) being known as <b>rubber</b> <b>elastic</b> theory is given below, which may describe the structure of hydrogels in solvent.|$|R
