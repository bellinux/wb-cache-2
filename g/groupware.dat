25|$|Telecommuting is the {{performance}} within a traditional worker and employer relationship {{when it is}} facilitated by tools such as <b>groupware,</b> virtual private networks, conference calling, videoconferencing, and voice over IP (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.|$|E
25|$|The Computer Science Masters program offers {{instruction}} in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work {{in the computer industry}} or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree {{are in a position to}} hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, <b>groupware</b> and computational finance. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.|$|E

Harple has been called a visionary, an Internet pioneer, and a [...] "serial entrepreneur", founding multiple technology start-ups and playing a key role in the development of technologies like collaborative <b>groupware,</b> Voice over IP, and interactive screen sharing whiteboards. Harple also holds a number of core technology patents for inventions in VoIP, media streaming, real time web communications, collaborative computing, and location-based social media.|$|E
5000|$|The {{complexity}} of <b>groupware</b> development {{is still an}} issue. One {{reason for this is}} the socio-technical dimension of <b>groupware.</b> <b>Groupware</b> designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects [...] and the social group processes that should be supported with the <b>groupware</b> application. Some examples for issues in <b>groupware</b> development are: ...|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} for addressing these issues {{is the use}} of design patterns for <b>groupware</b> design. The patterns identify recurring <b>groupware</b> design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the <b>groupware</b> development process.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} from <b>groupware</b> is {{the intensity of}} collaboration. According to Lubich's classification, <b>groupware</b> supports collaboration within groups where the individual contributions remain identifiable. In contrast, EMS enable the group to cooperatively produce a result for which the group is responsible as a whole. In a business process, <b>groupware</b> and electronic meeting systems complement each other: <b>Groupware</b> supports teams when researching and creating documents in the run up to an EMS session or when implementing the results of such a session.|$|E
50|$|While <b>groupware</b> enables {{geographically}} dispersed teams to achieve organizational goals {{and engage in}} cooperative work, there are also many challenges that accompany use of such systems. For instance, <b>groupware</b> often requires users {{to learn a new}} system, which users may perceive as creating more work for them without much benefit. If team members are not willing to learn and adopt <b>groupware,</b> it is difficult (if not impossible) for the organization to develop the requisite critical mass for the <b>groupware</b> to be useful. Further, research has found that <b>groupware</b> requires careful implementation into a group setting, and product developers have not as yet been able to find the most optimal way to introduce such systems into organizational environments.|$|E
50|$|It {{incorporates}} <b>groupware</b> capabilities over SyncML protocol, {{as well as}} SMTP, IMAP and POP protocols. In 2009 {{it became}} a replacement for discontinued <b>Groupware</b> Server 6 developed by Software602.|$|E
5000|$|Even further back, in 1978 Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz {{coined the}} term groupware; their initial 1978 {{definition}} of <b>groupware</b> was, “intentional group processes plus software to support them.” Later in their article {{they went on to}} explain <b>groupware</b> as “computer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace." [...] <b>Groupware</b> integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.|$|E

50|$|However, a {{collaborative}} work system (CWS) {{does not necessarily}} require <b>groupware</b> support.
