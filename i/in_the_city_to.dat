5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was born}} to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria. He served as the night {{watchman}} of the city's al-Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards. Damascus was captured by Arab rebels during World War I in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an Arab nationalist organization, emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> raise support for the rebels. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir Faisal, who formed a rudimentary government. Al-Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun. Afterward, the French ruled Syria {{under the aegis of}} their League of Nations mandate.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} for us to realize the situation that existed at that time. Many of the villages or fairly large communities did not have facilities for even primary education. The students from villages, where most of the Khadayata families were settled, had to live with their relatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> <b>to</b> obtain primary education. Education for the girls was almost nonexistent.|$|R

5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{was born}} in Portland, Maine on March 20, 1804, the son of Josiah Dow and his wife, Dorcas Allen Dow.

Dorcas Allen was also a Quaker, and a member of a prosperous Maine family headed by her prominent grandfather, Hate-Evil Hall. They had three children, of whom Neal was the middle child and only son. After his marriage, Dow's father opened a tannery in Portland, which soon became a successful business. After attending a Friends school in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and further schooling at Edward Payson's Portland Academy, Dow followed his father into the tanning trade in 1826. He embraced technology, becoming one of the first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> incorporate steam power in the tanning process.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{returned}} to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 in rent. This angered Ross {{and contributed to the}} breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a flat in Camden Town with his friend Dinah Snock, whom he had met at an anti-imperialist rally in Trafalgar Square. Kenyatta socialised at the Student Movement House in Russell Square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended various Africans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>To</b> earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film Sanders of the River, filmed at Shepperton Studios in Autumn 1934. A number of other Africans in London criticised him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American Paul Robeson.|$|E

5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city.

The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary {{under the cover of}} their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, the KPA's 5th Division entered Yongdok, {{taking the}} city without much {{resistance}} before fierce UN air attacks caused the division heavy losses.

By now, the 5th Division and the 766th Regiment had been reduced to a combined strength of 7,500 men to the ROK 3rd Divisions' 6,469. The 766th massed its force again to assist the 5th Division in surrounding and besieging the ROK 3rd Division, which was trapped in the city. The 3rd Division, in the meantime, was ordered to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> delay the North Koreans as long as possible. It was eventually evacuated by sea after delaying North Korean forces for a considerable time. The rugged terrain of the mountains prevented the North Korean forces from conducting the enveloping maneuvers they had used so effectively against other troops, and their advantages in numbers and equipment had been negated in the fight.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the stadium was commissioned by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in the mid-1930s as the centrepiece of a new sports complex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>to</b> be named Foro Mussolini.

After hosting the 1987 World Athletics Championships, the stadium was redeveloped {{in time for the}} 1990 FIFA World Cup, at which West Germany's 1–0 win over Argentina in the final was played there. The stadium's most recent renovation, in 2008, brought the capacity to 72,689.|$|E

A series of running battles between fans of the two clubs followed, resulting in 22 arrests (including two boys aged just 11 and 13) as well as a man suffering stab wounds and a police officer suffering a broken arm. On the day of the game, an army of around 50 Cardiff and Liverpool hooligans were seen attacking United supporters in the Wood Street area.|$|E

5|$|The {{route of}} the A1 in London runs from the {{northern}} end of St. Martin's Le Grand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>to</b> Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, then travels on the northern fringe of Greater London to Bignell's Corner, where it crosses the M25 and becomes a motorway, designated A1(M), which alternates with the dual carriageway A1 as it continues to Edinburgh. The London section of the road passes through part of the City of London and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet. The A1 is one of London's main northern routes, providing a link to the M1 motorway and the A1(M) motorway, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. It connects a number of major areas within London, and sections of it serve as the High Street for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London. Even though it is one of London's major roads, less than 5% of its approximate 60,000 vehicles a day are through traffic – the bulk is local.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the exact}} extent of losses was unclear, the {{earthquake}} caused further damage to many structures in Christchurch; {{approximately half of}} the buildings in the centre of the city were already damaged or destroyed by previous strong earthquakes.

Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a road intersection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> collapse.
