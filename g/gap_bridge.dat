40|$|Abstract. Growing {{demand to}} reduce fuel {{consumption}} has accelerated {{the application of}} Al sheets to the body structure of automobiles. While recent studies on laser welding of Al 5 xxx series and Al 6 xxx series alloys have examined weldability, the laser autogenous welding usually results in low <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and weld defects such as porosity, underfill, cracking, and so on. In this study, we evaluated the <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and the crack sensitivity during laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire, and laser-arc hybrid welding, respectively. Al 5 J 32 and 6 K 21 sheets were used as the base metal and Al 4 xxx series and Al 5 xxx series wires were used as the filler metal. Employing adequate welding conditions, the <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability during butt welding was investigated for each welding process. To clarify the solidification crack sensitivity, bead-on-plate welding was implemented for a tapered specimen as a self-restraint crack test. Compared with the laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire and the laser-arc hybrid welding showed improved <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and reduced crack sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|In an {{on going}} study of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> for thin plate Nd:YAG laser lap welds, {{empirical}} data, high speed imaging, and computer modeling were utilized {{to better understand}} surface physics attributed to the formation and solidification of a weld pool. Experimental data indicates better <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> can be achieved through optimized laser parameters such as pulse length, duration, and energy. Long pulse durations at low energies generating low peak powers were found to create the highest percent of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability. At constant peak power, gap-bridging ability was further improved by using a smaller spot diameter resulting in higher irradiances. Hence, welding in focus is preferable for <b>bridging</b> <b>gaps.</b> Gas shielding was also found to greatly impact gap-bridging ability. Gapped lap welds {{that could not be}} bridged with UHP Argon gas shielding, were easily bridged when left unshielded and exposed to only air. Incident weld angle and joint offset were also investigated for their ability to improve <b>gap</b> <b>bridging.</b> Optical filters and brightlight surface illumination enabled high-speed imaging to capture the fluid dynamics of a forming and solidifying weld pool. The effects of various laser parameters and the weld pool's interaction with the laser beam could also be observed utilizing the high-speed imaging. The work described is used to develop and validate a computer model with improved weld pool physics. Finite element models have been used to derive insight into the physics of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging.</b> The dynamics of the fluid motion within the weld pool in conjunction with the free surface physics have been the primary focus of the modeling efforts. Surface tension {{has been found to be}} a more significant factor in determining final weld pool shape than expected...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the problem of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> and junction detection. Perceptual groupings and evidence from existing boundaries are combined to produce joins which are consistent with the initial image structure. In particular, a new definition of co-curvilinearity, which distinguishes between true and false co-curvilinearity, is given. Structural quantities are computed for all potential joins. A local non-iterative algorithm selects the best joins and/or junctions which satisfy specific structural conditions. No assumption, domain restriction, or model is needed. The current implementation is fully presented together with the results obtained.

40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} of laser welding processes with its specific advantages, such as low distortion or production efficiency, is often limited when joining thin-walled aluminum components due to small <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability. To overcomethis limit, {{a novel approach}} is presented using filler wire and a highly focused laser beam oscillation transverse to the welding direction. In the present work, the process development for welding in butt-joint configuration is shown. For this purpose, {{the influence of the}} welding speed, wire feed speed and beam oscillation parameters on wire melting behavior and on the welding result is presented. A process window for joining thin sheet material of 1 mm thickness with 1 mm joint gap is shown, and allowable tolerances for laser, wire and gap misalignment are investigated. Furthermore, the reached <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability of 1. 9 mm for a constant gapand 3. 15 mm for an opening gap configuration is shown in dependence of the utilized aluminum alloys...|$|R

Through Berkeley County, Back Creek flows through an expansive valley. It continues north by the community of Glengary which developed near it, is crossed by West Virginia Route 45, and goes past Ganotown. North of Ganotown, after the confluence with Tub Run, Leading Ridge forms {{the western edge of}} Back Creek's valley. It meanders northeast through the community of Shanghai. From Shanghai, Back Creek continues to be fed by spring streams off North Mountain. With North Mountain bounding it to the east, Back Creek continues northeast, lined by several communities, including Tomahawk, Hedgesville, and Soho.

40|$|The {{compact and}} modular set up of high power diode lasers permits {{simultaneous}} laser beam welding. The entire weld seam is irradiated {{as a whole}} and welded with one single laser pulse (sequence). Apart from short process times, which are of interest for big lot production, simultaneous welding allows a more moderate irradiation (interaction). Additionally, it promises wider process windows, a marked <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability as well as an enhanced weld strength compared to contour welding. By means of appropriate beam forming and guiding a homogeneous intensity distribution fitting to the entire weld seam geometry has to be generated, which represents the challenge of the simultaneous process. There are different strategies possible to accomplish simultaneous welding. Some strategies will be illustrated in brief. Furthermore, results of systematic investigation concerning weldability, <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability, hermetic sealing as well as reachable burst pressure of sample boxes are presented.

Brake pipe pressure is set to 70 lbs. fully charged and controlling speed with needed reductions as the grade and load require. The light weight of the cars is accentuated when the train is full vs. empty, making {{a big difference in}} how the engineer will handle the train on the return. While riding the train, you will likely hear the hiss of air being released from the brake cylinders as the train goes into the long horseshoe curve, where the grade is flat enough to maintain speed and recharge the brake pipe at the same time. As the engine nears the end of the curve, another set is generally made progressively and will be maintained until the Thunderhead <b>Gap</b> <b>bridge,</b> where the process is repeated and the final application is made for the descent into the lower loop.

In that year, ten new Crampton {{locomotives}} were built, and one of these, No.136 Folkstone was exhibited at The Great Exhibition. In 1854, Crampton {{became a member of the}} Institution of Civil Engineers and in 1855 he was responsible for the building of the Berlin waterworks. In 1856, Crampton was appointed to the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. In 1859, Crampton formed the Broadstairs Water Company, building a water tower 80 ft high which now forms the Crampton Tower Museum. The water tower could hold 83000 imp gal of water. Broadstairs Water Company was taken over by Broadstairs Urban District Council in 1901. In 1860, Crampton designed a tower for Holy Trinity church, Broadstairs, which Dickens had described as a [...] "hideous temple of flint, a petrified haystack". Crampton donated a clock as a personal gift to the church. he also donated a wrought iron bridge which was built across Goodson Steps. This is the Louisa <b>Gap</b> <b>bridge,</b> named after his youngest daughter. Crampton was elected Vice-President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1883.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to keep the Pennsylvania Turnpike system under public control, in June 2007, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission {{proposed}} tolling Interstate 80 as a means of raising transportation revenue. It is seeking the permission to put tolls on the highway through a Federal Highway Administration pilot program that allows three states to place tolls on interstates. Missouri's Interstate 70 and Virginia had already taken two of the spots. Under the plan, the PTC would assume all maintenance and toll-taking operations on I-80. The plan calls for up to ten toll plazas along the length of I-80 in Pennsylvania with a toll rate of , which would be comparable to the rate on the Pennsylvania Turnpike following a projected toll increase. Originally, I-80 was part of the PTC's 1,000 Mile Turnpike system, but {{with the passage of the}} Interstate Highway Act in 1954, the PTC abandoned the 1000 mi system and only maintained the original east-west Turnpike and its Northeastern Extension. Currently the only toll on I-80 in Pennsylvania is at the Delaware Water <b>Gap</b> <b>bridge</b> between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. [...] Tolling on I-80 was to be completed by 2010.

50|$|The {{locomotives}} perform much differently for {{the crews}} {{going up the}} grade. The #70 has more power and does not usually struggle with a loaded train, however the #192, with larger drivers, longer frame, and lower boiler pressure, needs to be run with the throttle wide open and speed adjusted with the Johnson Bar. The first grade {{right out of the}} station is upwards of 5%, and the #192 will stall and need to make another run at the hill if it loses enough momentum. The grade does flatten out for a couple hundred feet as it approaches the Thunderhead <b>Gap</b> <b>bridge.</b> The engineer will blow a warning whistle for the crossing just beyond the bridge, and as the train emerges from the trees, the throttle is opened up as the engine hits the second hill and grinds up the 3-4% grade to the horseshoe curve beyond Sawmill Rd. At the end of this curve, the #192 with its long frame will buck against the curvature which is evidenced by the wear on the frame behind the trailing and pilot trucks. After negotiating a small S-curve through a cut in the hillside, the grade steepens again to about 6% until topping over near the upper loop switch. The crew will need to have enough water in the boiler to keep the crown sheet of the firebox covered for the downhill trip, and while the engineer is blowing the whistle and making the first brake pipe reduction, the fireman is using the raging fire to inject water against the climbing pressure gauge.|$|E
50|$|North of the Portland-Columbia Bridge, {{the road}} widened {{from two to}} four lanes at a left side exit to Columbia, NJ. Less than a mile north-west was a {{three-way}} intersection with only a caution light where Route 94 began and ran northeast. Right after that intersection, Route 611 became a four-lane divided freeway and crossed the Delaware River a few miles further north on the Delaware Water Gap Toll bridge. After crossing into Pennsylvania, the divided highway narrowed again for a mile to a four lane road and curved into downtown Delaware Water Gap. There it intersected U.S. 611 Alternate and continued on to Stroudsburg. In 1959, {{it was announced that}} Interstate 80 would eventually be designated on the freeway. In 1964, U.S. Route 209 was moved to a newly built freeway to bypass Stroudsburg and wind south of the city. (The old alignment of U.S. 209 was redesignated as U.S. 209 Business from several miles north of East Stroudsburg to five miles south of Stroudsburg.) US 611 freeway was extended by a mile and when it ran into the then-newly built US 209 bypass, US 611 continued to run concurrently through Stroudsburg. Just west of Stroudsburg US 209 headed south and merged with 209 Business. US 611 continued west a few miles and winded slightly north and merged with US 611 alternate. The original US 611 from Delaware Water Gap past Stroudsburg was now also Alternate US 611. In 1963, the Pennsylvania Highways Department recommended replacing US 611 Alternate with US 611, with the US 611 designation to be removed from I-80. In 1965, the stretch of US 611 from the Route 94 intersection up past the Delaware Water <b>Gap</b> <b>Bridge</b> through the merger with US 611 Alternate was designated both US 611 and Interstate 80. Also past the merger with the US 209 bypass, the freeway was designated interstate 80, US 209, and US 611. Past Stroudsburg the freeway headed south and merging with US 209 Business continued to be designated as US 209. The freeway headed northwest was designated US 611 and Interstate 80. By 1972, Pennsylvania portions of Interstate 80 in the state were completed.|$|E

This study sought to identify the regeneration law of nerve fibers in the biological conduit. A nerve regeneration chamber was constructed in models of sciatic nerve injury using 2 -mm small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> of a biodegradable biological conduit. The results showed that the biological conduit had good histocompatibility. Tissue and cell apoptosis in the conduit apparently lessened, and regenerating nerve fibers were common. The degeneration regeneration law of Schwann cells and axons in the conduit was quite different from that in traditional epineurium suture. During the prime period for nerve fiber regeneration (2 - 8 weeks), the number of Schwann cells and nerve fibers was higher in both proximal and distal ends, and the effects of the small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> method were better than those of the traditional epineurium suture. The above results provide an objective and reliable theoretical basis for the clinical application of the biological conduit small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> method to repair peripheral nerve injury. ...|$|R
