30|$|The {{dominant}} {{story that}} humanitarian aid has told about itself for decades {{is rooted in}} the experience of Henri Dunant at the Battlefield of Solferino in 1859. This set into motion the evolution of International Humanitarian Law and the definition and organization of modern humanitarianism as a principled endeavour. The first Geneva Conventions, initiated in the 1860 s, regulated the conduct of armed conflict and were seeking to limit its effect. They recognised the International Committee of the Red Cross as guardian of the conventions and ICRC – and the Red Cross Red Crescent movement in its wake developed to provide protection and assistance to war-affected. The classic paradigm of humanitarianism is based on the basic principles of humanity, <b>impartiality,</b> neutrality <b>and</b> <b>independence,</b> meant to ensure that humanitarian aid is purely needs-based: decisions to help must not be driven by political motives or by discrimination of any kind.|$|R

30|$|Humanitarian organisations provide {{life-saving}} {{assistance to}} populations {{in times of}} crises and use the humanitarian principles of humanity, <b>impartiality,</b> neutrality, <b>and</b> <b>independence</b> to guide their work (ICRC 1996). Humanitarian organisations of all types struggle {{with the concept of}} political engagement. Engagement implies involvement with other actors, the reverse of isolation. In admitting a relationship or a connection with others, one does not shy away from active participation with themes of concern to other actors. Engagement facilitates differentiating oneself from other actors, identifies similarities with others, and more generally helps to construct the political environment within which one is working. In establishing who one’s friends and enemies are by identifying their political positions relative to one’s own, it is possible to engage in an appropriate manner with each and to develop an understanding of the political arena within which one is working. 1 For a humanitarian organisation, political engagement is a means to an end—to assist with the implementation of humanitarian programmes and reduce the efficacy of the direct drivers of human suffering.|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} nature of armed conflict has had a dramatic impact on the security risks facing humanitarian personnel. Historically, the safety of humanitarian aid delivery was secured through {{the consent of the}} relevant Parties to the conflict. However, non-international ethnically-motivated armed conflicts, failed and failing states, and insurgency-based warfare have fundamentally challenged the viability of this traditional security paradigm. In confronting today 2 ̆ 7 s complex security climate, humanitarian organizations are faced with a diverse menu of alternatives to enhance their security. The debate over armed protection that has sharply divided the humanitarian community is explored in this paper, including a critique of specific armed protection options. Tensions between the safe and efficient delivery of aid, <b>and</b> principles of <b>impartiality,</b> neutrality <b>and</b> <b>independence</b> are discussed. The implications of humanitarian organizations using private security companies for defensive armed protection have been relatively unexplored, particularly with respect to international humanitarian law. This paper aims to address this shortcoming by considering two threshold questions: is the protected status of humanitarian personnel under international humanitarian law suspended or lost if they use armed private security contractors; and, is humanitarian access to provide relief legally affected by the decision to hire a private security company for armed protection of relief consignments...|$|R

Conclusions are drawn regarding their potential role in future shifts towards efficient consumer information practices in Bulgaria. ...|$|R

40|$|Humanitarian {{assistance}} {{and protection of}} victims of war are not an easy task. The success of its implementation, in a large extent, depends on respect and care given to the humanitarian principles. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze what these principles are, their importance and the challenges to its fulfillment in the state of humanitarian crises. The methodology used is bibliographic and documental research. On the first topic, the discussion is about the convergences between International Law of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, especially looking at human rights protection. Then, it presents the principles of impartiality, neutrality, independence, volunteerism, unity, universality and humanity proclaimed at the XX International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 1965. After establishing the general notions, it is possible to make a critical analysis of the importance and the challenges of compliance in the principles of <b>impartiality,</b> neutrality <b>and</b> <b>independence,</b> taking as its starting point the specific situations reported in the official documents of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). At the end, the conclusion is that, despite the difficultiesand several challenges, we should not spare any effort to ensure accomplishment of the humanitarian principles during crises. The search for an effective humanitarian {{assistance and}}, in fact, effective power for laws that protect victims of war and also humanitarian workers goes into a necessary hermeneutical system founded on humanitarian principles...|$|R
40|$|The {{claim that}} the jury is a {{randomly}} chosen and representative sample of community {{is an important part}} of the ideology which currently underpins the institution. Supporters of the jury argue that both its <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> its <b>independence</b> from the State are bolstered by the fact that it represents a randomly selected cross-section of the populace. In most common law jurisdictions where the jury operates, various steps have been taken over recent years in order preserve and strengthen the perception of the jury as a 2 ̆ 2 microcosm of democratic society 2 ̆ 2. For example, in England the property qualification for jurors was removed in 1972 and, consequently, the franchise became virtually universal. Similar moves have recently taken place in various Australian jurisdictions. Against this background of increasingly representative juries elsewhere, the Hong Kong jury is an oddity. Like most of the legal institutions and laws of Hong Kong, it was imported to the colony from England, the colonising power. Indeed, the English law concerning juries and jurors still applies to Hong Kong in so far as it does not conflict with the special provisions made for the jurisdiction by the Jury Ordinance. Yet the Hong Kong jury is not in the least representative of the Hong Kong community, nor has there been any attempt to make it so. The major purpose of this article, therefore, is to discuss the unusual composition of the Hong Kong jury. First, however, it is useful to outline briefly the development of some of the more important and unique aspects of the way in which the Hong Kong jury operates...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{focuses on}} the {{conceptual}} relationship between the principles of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of judges, with particular regard to the Italian constitutional experience. In Western judicial systems, <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> are strictly connected to other important requirements, such as the judge's professional quality, effectiveness and the speed of judicial proceedings, not less than to the accountability of the judge himself. By consequence, the author maintains that the judicial function must always accommodate many other different needs {{of the political system}} as a whole, preserving not only judge's impartiality, but also the "reputation" of judge's impartiality. Moreover, the legitimacy of our magistracy as a professional order requires necessarily a social consent, which cannot be sustained without the perception of the <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> responsibility of the judges. The one outcome of the uncontrolled growth of judge's independence regardless of the <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> responsibility of this class of officials is the privileged status of Italian magistracy, which amounts to a true anomaly in our Western judicial systems...|$|R
