40|$|In this work, the structure, {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of PET fiber obtained by hot multi-stage drawing {{have been investigated}} {{in terms of their}} dependence on the number of drawing steps at an equivalent total draw ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry, birefringence, wide-angle x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, tensile properties, and taut-tie molecules were used to characterize the fine structure and physical properties of the fibers. Results have been explained in terms of a higher drawing residence time at an equivalent drawing speed. For single stage <b>drawn</b> <b>fiber,</b> a high tensile strength is obtained, whereas a high initial modulus is obtained for fiber drawn at three-stage drawing. According to the results, an important finding is that three-stage drawing process has the potential to produce high-modulus fibers.

The specific surface areas of well-dispersed functionalized nanosilica particles in UHMWPE/functionalized nanosilica fibers can positively affect their ultradrawing, orientation, ultimate tensile properties, and “micro-fibrils” morphologies. Excellent orientation and ultimate tensile properties of UHMWPE/nanofiller fibers can be prepared by ultradrawing the UHMWPE/functionalized nanosilica as-prepared fibers with optimal contents of the best prepared functionalized nanosilica particles well dispersing in the as-prepared fibers.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} nanorobotic fiber {{fabrication}} method which uses proximal probes to draw polymer fibers down to few hundred nanometers {{in diameter and}} several hundred micrometers in length. Using proximal probes such as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) or glass micropippettes, liquid polymers dissolved in a solvent are drawn. During drawing, the solvent evaporates in real-time which solidifies the fiber. Controlling the drawn fibers trajectory and solidification in three-dimensions (3 D), suspended fibers, fiber cantilevers, custom 3 D fibers, and fiber networks, are proposed to be fabricated. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer dissolved in chlorobenzene is used to form a variety of suspended polymer fibers with diameters from few microns to 200 nm. Fabrication of crossed and linear networks of fibers is also demonstrated. Viscoelastic modeling of polymer fiber drawing is realized using a finite element method to test {{the significance of the}} drawing speed and velocity profile on the extensional behavior of the <b>drawn</b> <b>fiber.</b> Since the mechanical properties of the drawn micro/nanofibers could vary from the bulk polymer material significantly, mechanical characterization of suspended fibers using an AFM and a Nanoindenter setup is proposed.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 83). The dramatic spectral broadening of an electromagnetic radiation as it propagates through a nonlinear medium is called Supercontinuum generation. Supercontinuum generation is indeed {{regarded as one}} of the prominent phenomenon in nonlinear optics and photonics with burgeoning applications in various fields such as spectroscopy, early cancer diagnostics, gas sensing, food quality control, uorescence microscopy e. t. c. Supercontinuum generation in optical fibers is however associated with three fundamental challenges: minimization of input power threshold, maximization of output power as well as output spectrum of a supercontinuum. Two unique fabrication approaches namely "Direct tapering" and "Multicore fibers" were proposed to address the aforementioned challenges. Chalcogenide nanowires were fabricated via direct tapering of chalcogenide glasses, and spectral broadening with extremely low peak power of 2 W was demonstrated. Multicore array of chalcogenide step index fibers were also fabricated using a new method. The fabricated step index fiber has a diameter 1. 35 m which was engineered to have a zero dispersion wavelength (ZDW) around 1100 nm with a pump of center wavelength at 1550 nm. Using split step Fourier method, it was shown that the fiber possesses a great potential for severe spectral broadening.

40|$|Because the gel-spinning {{process has}} the {{potential}} to yield fibers of high strength and high modulus, this technique was employed to process continuous filaments of PVA/CNT, having CNTs at ¡Ü 1 weight percent of polymer. A gel aging technique was employed with the goal of increasing the draw ratio for composite fibers and for promoting the development of crystalline PVA. Since residual solvent can lower the mechanical properties of drawn fibers, solvent phases of water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) within the drawn fibers were also characterized. As embedded SWNTs were uniaxially aligned along the <b>drawn</b> <b>fiber</b> axis, they were found to induce preferential alignment in the PVA side groups {{as well as for the}} residual solvent. This was attributed to charge transfer between SWNT and the respective functional groups. This orientation behavior has been characterized using Raman spectroscopy and infra-red dichroism. The behaviors of gel crystallization and solvent freezing within PVA/CNT dispersions were studied using thermal analysis and rheology. Carbon nanotubes were found to nucleate PVA crystallization in the gel state. PVA/CNT gel aging behavior was characterized by structural, thermal, and mechanical, and dynamic mechanical means. Gel aging was shown to increase the draw ratio of PVA/CNT fibers, and the development of the higher temperature melting peak was attributed to the draw induced ordering of PVA along CNTs. The scanning electron micrographs of fractured PVA/CNT fibers showed fibrils having an average diameter of about 22 nm. The storage modulus of aged gel was a function of solvent diffusion, which changed with aging time. CNTs were shown to have stabilized the gel network, as characterized by the dynamic mechanical properties, and to provide nucleation sites for the ordering of PVA chains, as characterized by WAXD.
