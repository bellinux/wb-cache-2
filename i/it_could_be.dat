5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> assembled.

5|$|An {{important}} {{clause of}} the constitution was that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that hydrogen peroxide is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there was}} no Middle Ages in Brazil, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> the knight, as in the European chivalric romances; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> the Portuguese man either, since Brazilians still held resentment for the years of colonization; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> the black man either, since the mentality of the time did not allow it. Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, {{especially}} works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the [...] "noble savage" [...] myth, the authors chose the Brazilian Indian to represent the new nation.|$|R
5000|$|At 10 p.m. on October 11, Columbus saw a light [...] "like a small wax candle {{that rose}} and lifted up". He pointed {{it out to}} other people on board, {{some of whom were}} able to see the light, while others did not. The actual {{landfall}} was about 35 miles from the location Columbus saw the light, so if taken that the light was from a ground-based source, then <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not have <b>been</b> from Guanahani, but must have been from another island farther east. For the Plana Cays theory, the light would have been on Mayaguana. For Conception, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> on Cat Island, Watlings Island or Rum Cay. For Caicos <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> on Grand Turk. For Cat Island <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> on Watlings Island and for Lignum Vitae Cay <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> Eleuthera Island.

5|$|The T194 {{training}} round was discontinued in 2002. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{considered an}} early version of the SS192 or SS195. It used the same 1.8-g (28grain) copper-jacketed aluminum core bullet, propelled at the same muzzle velocity. It had a green tip.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} the first aquatic Skynet robot, the Hydrobot, which Laing modeled on eels, and {{was built by}} the animatronics crew with its exterior made of metal-looking rubber so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used in the aquatic scenes.|$|E
5|$|While Delrina {{lost the}} court case, the {{publicity}} it generated was substantial, with coverage {{in over a}} thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> recalled.|$|E

5000|$|According to Matthew Green, a {{computer}} {{science professor at}} the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute {{and leader of the}} TrueCrypt audit in 2014, TrueCrypt “was written by anonymous folks; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> Paul Le Roux writing under an assumed name, or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> someone completely different.” ...|$|R

5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news.

5|$|Along the route, if a settler {{needed the}} BX to stop, they simply raised a white flag along the {{riverbank}} and the steamer would pull over and land. A white flag was never ignored, it might {{only be a}} settler wanting to ship some produce to market, or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a sick child that needed emergency transportation to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E

Hulk was scrapped so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt completely in 2016 and Dragon Challenge will be dismantled {{so it can}} be replaced by an unknown coaster in 2019.

5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas.

5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the government-funded Egg Marketing Board.
