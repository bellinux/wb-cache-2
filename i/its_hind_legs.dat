5|$|The levade: a {{position}} wherein the horse raises up both front legs, {{standing at a}} 30-degree angle entirely on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> in a controlled form that requires {{a great deal of}} hindquarter strength. A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45-degree angle.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may {{jump in the}} air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, {{in a way it}} resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E

Ulick and Albinia called to it, and it looked up and tried to wag its tail, whining appealingly. 'My poor brute!' he cried, 'they've treated you worse than a heathen. That's all--let me see what I can do for you.' ...|$|R
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} sting. The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves by {{trying to make the}} ant sting them, by waving <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia have been found in the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
50|$|Hesperornis {{was a large}} bird, {{reaching}} up to 1.8 m in length. It had virtually no wings, and swam with <b>its</b> powerful <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> Fossil evidence shows that the toes were probably lobed, as in today's grebes, rather than webbed as in those of loons.|$|R
50|$|Named for its pale-furred {{back and}} long hind limbs and feet, the pale {{kangaroo}} mouse is a large-headed rodent with fur-lined external cheek pouche.

5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> that connected {{to the base of}} the tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E

50|$|Both {{adults and}} nymphs of this assassin bug are {{specialist}} predators on ants. The feeding behaviour of the nymph has been closely studied. It stands near an ant trail and waves one of <b>its</b> hairy <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> {{to attract the}} attention of a passing ant, the jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) often being targeted. The prey may be bigger than the nymph, and is also lured towards the bug by the release of a pheromone. When an ant approaches, the nymph raises its body so that the ant can taste the secretion produced by the trichome. The bug waits for the ant to grab <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> and then turns round and plunges the stylets in the proboscis into a weak spot in the ant's cuticle, the joint at the back of the head. It then jerks and shakes the ant around, perhaps to prevent it from biting, and injects saliva into the wound. The ant soon dies and the bug may carry it to a crevice or other concealed spot. When the body contents of the ant have liquefied, the bug sucks out the body fluids.|$|R

25|$|Years later, Mantell had {{acquired}} enough fossil {{evidence to show}} that the dinosaur's forelimbs were much shorter than <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs,</b> therefore proving they were not built like a mammal as claimed by Sir Richard Owen. Mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil vertebrae, which Owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to Iguanodon. He also named a new genus of dinosaur called Hylaeosaurus and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles.|$|E

25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg</b> steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> come back under the body.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} that Mrs. Eddy had {{unloaded}} that dismal gift on to her National Association, she had followed her inveterate custom: she had tied a string to <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>leg,</b> and kept one end of it hitched to her belt. We have seen her {{do that in the}} case of the Boston Mosque. When she deeds property, she puts in that string-clause. It provides that under certain conditions she can pull the string and land the property in the cherished home of its happy youth. In the present case she believed that she had made provision that if at any time the National Christian Science Association should dissolve itself by a formal vote, she could pull.|$|R

25|$|During {{the main}} season of its activity, May through September, the {{entrance}} to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered heaps of sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of her front legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands on <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs.</b> In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up <b>its</b> <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E
50|$|From {{the scant}} remains the living animal {{would appear to}} have been about three metres long (10 ft), with a {{typically}} prosauropodan appearance: bulky body, long neck, small head and clawed feet.

5000|$|The idea of {{a boxing}} {{kangaroo}} originates from the animal's defensive behavior, in which it will use its smaller forelegs (its [...] "arms") to hold an attacker in place while using the claws on <b>its</b> larger <b>hind</b> <b>legs</b> to try to kick, slash or disembowel them.
