5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However {{the interior was}} a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich,</b> almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E

25|$|Because it is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> Milky Way star field, Delphinus {{has several}} deep-sky objects. NGC 6891 is a {{planetary}} nebula of magnitude 10.5 {{and one more}} notable planetary nebula is NGC 6905 or the Blue Flash nebula. NGC 6934 is a globular cluster of magnitude 9.75. At {{a distance of about}} 185,000 light-years, the globular cluster NGC 7006 is extremely remote. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5.|$|E
25|$|Delphinus {{does not}} have any bright stars; its {{brightest}} star is of magnitude 3.8. The main asterism in Delphinus is Job's Coffin, formed from the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Alpha and Beta Delphini are named Sualocin and Rotanev, respectively. When read backwards, they read as Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of Palermo Observatory's former director, Niccolò Cacciatore. However, Delphinus is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> Milky Way star field.|$|E
25|$|ATP {{builds up}} when the cell is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> medium, {{triggering}} DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size. ATP competes with ADP to bind to DnaA, and the DnaA-ATP complex is able to initiate replication. A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication — each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication.|$|E

When ill, or at other times of crisis, or to seek supernatural help, Cambodians may enlist the aid of a practitioner who is believed to be able to propitiate or obtain help from various spirits.

25|$|Durif, or Petite Sirah, is a {{descendant}} of Syrah and Peloursin. It was propagated by and named after Dr. Francois Durif. Durif is a cross breed between the lesser known Peloursin and Syrah. Regions such as Rutherglen have achieved international regard for their Durif. This varietal is similar to Shiraz, but even more full bodied and tannic because of the smaller, thicker skinned grapes used. Petite Sirah is widely planted in California, where it is popular as a varietal (for example, by Bogle Vineyards), and especially blended with Zinfandel, which results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich,</b> bold and fruity wine.|$|E

In 1920, he was elected to the Madras Legislative Council and served as the Minister of Public Works and Education from 1921 to 1926. In 1937, Patro was elected to the Odisha Legislative Council.

According to Scott Galloway, the founder of L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, latest studies estimate that 93% of prestige brands have an active presence on Instagram and include it in their marketing mix. When it comes to brands and businesses, Instagram's goal is to help companies to reach their respective audiences through captivating imagery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich,</b> visual environment.

The domed ceiling of the Breakfast Room, inset with convex mirrors, has influenced architects from around the world. The Library-Dining Room reflects the influence of Etruscan tombs and perhaps even gothic design in its repertoire of small pendants like those in fan vaulting. It is decorated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> 'Pompeian' red.

25|$|Also in 1971, {{the group}} {{toyed with the}} idea of adding a second drummer, supplementing Hartman's {{drumming}} on some of their shows with that of Navy veteran Michael Hossack while still touring behind their first album. In October 1971, the band recorded several songs for their second album with Shogren on bass, guitar, and background vocals. But a little later, during the album's recording, Shogren left after disagreements with the group's new producer, Ted Templeman. Shogren was replaced in December 1971 with singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Tiran Porter, while Hossack was added to the lineup at the same time as a regular. Porter and Hossack were both stalwarts of the Northern California music scene, Porter having previously played in Scratch with Simmons. Porter brought a funkier bass style to the band and added his husky baritone to the voices of Johnston and Simmons, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> three-part harmonic vocal blend.|$|E

25|$|Peter Aerts began 1999 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> vein of form, {{finishing}} Michael McDonald, Jim Mullen, Matt Skelton, Maurice Smith and Sam Greco, respectively, {{over the}} course of five months. At the K-1 World Grand Prix '99 Opening Round, the qualifying round for the 1999 K-1 WGP, on October 5, 1999, he took a unanimous decision victory over Lloyd van Dams. In the quarter-finals of the K-1 Grand Prix '99 Final Round on December 5, 1999, Aerts went up against Jérôme Le Banner for the third time. Just fifteen seconds into the first round, he dropped the big Frenchman with a high kick. Although dazed and clearly hurt, Le Banner was able to make the count and came back to knock Aerts out with a devastating left hook at just over the one minute-mark of round number one, sending the reigning champion crashing out of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where {{the number of}} terminals is {{much less than the}} number of base station (mobile station) antennas. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rich</b> scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E

South African captain Graeme Smith declared on the final morning of a rain-curtailed match and tried {{to open up the}} game in a bid to equal the series. He left Australia a target of 287 runs in 76 overs, and Ponting made 143 not out in only 159 balls to secure an eight-wicket win. It was the first time anyone had scored two centuries in their 100th Test and Ponting was named man of the match and man of the series. He had scored 515 runs at 103.00.|$|E
