50|$|The {{different}} colours are {{a result}} of the different charged states of the <b>dye</b> <b>molecule.</b> In the red form, all three nitrogen atoms carry a positive charge. The two sulfonic acid groups have extremely low pKa's and will normally be negatively charged, thus at a pH of around zero the dye will be a cation with an overall charge of +1. The green colour corresponds to a form of the dye with no net overall charge. In neutral media (pH 7), only the nitrogen atom of the diphenylamine moiety carries a positive charge and the blue <b>dye</b> <b>molecule</b> is an anion with an overall charge of -1.

Systematic studies of permeation of model <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> through these free-standing thin films are performed and effects of process parameters on the permeability and selectivity of the membranes synthesized using an all-dry process are demonstrated for the first time. Permeation studies of model <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> show that the diffusion of large <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> through the membrane is faster than the smaller <b>dye</b> <b>molecules,</b> due to loss of conformation entropy. Mesh sizes of the membranes are controlled by tuning the crosslink ratio of the polymer and diffusion coefficients of alizarin yellow model <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> are obtained as 0. 44 x 10 (- 7) and 1. 71 x 10 (- 7) cm(2) /s for high and low crosslinked membranes, respectively.

40|$|The decay {{dynamics}} of perylene <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> encapsulated in polymer nanofibers produced by electrospinning {{of polymethyl methacrylate}} are investigated using a confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy technique. Time-resolved experiments show that the fluorescence lifetime of perylene <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> is enhanced when the <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> are encapsulated in a three-dimensional photonic environment. It is hard to produce a sustainable host with exactly the same dimensions all the time during fabrication to accommodate <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> for enhancement of spontaneous emission rate. The electrospinning method allows {{us to have a}} control over fiber diameter. It is observed that the wavelength of monomer excitation of perylene <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> is too short to cause enhancement within nanofiber photonic environment of 330 nm diameters. However, when these nanofibers are doped with more concentrated perylene, in addition to monomer excitation, an excimer excitation is generated. This causes observation of the Purcell effect in the three-dimensional nanocylindrical photonic fiber geometry.

50|$|If the {{fluorescent}} signal is weak, amplification {{of the signal}} may be {{necessary in order to}} exceed the detection threshold of the microscope.

30|$|In a conclusion, the {{adsorption}} {{mechanism of}} BiOCl and Fe/BiOCl toward organic dyes could {{be summarized as}} follows: (1) For the adsorbent BiOCl, strong electrostatic attraction is the major reason for the adsorption capacity toward cationic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules,</b> but porous structure and high specific surface area are mainly responsible for the adsorption capacity toward anionic dye molecules; (2) For the adsorbent Fe/BiOCl, three aspects containing electrostatic attraction, more open porous structure, and higher specific surface area {{are responsible for the}} adsorption capacity toward cationic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules,</b> but the latter two aspects are the main reasons for the adsorption capacity toward anionic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules.</b>|$|R

50|$|Synthetic dyes {{are found}} {{in a wide range}} of {{products}} such as clothes, leather accessories, and furniture. These dyes are commonly used every day. However, a side effect of their widespread use is that up to 12% of these dyes are wasted during the dying process and about 20% of this wastage enters the environment (mainly into water supply). Dye degradation is a process in which the large <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> are broken down chemically into smaller molecules. The resulting products are water, carbon dioxide, and mineral byproducts that give the original dye its color. During the dyeing process, not all of the <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> are used. The water waste that the industry releases contains a percentage of these <b>dye</b> <b>molecules.</b> <b>Dye</b> <b>molecules</b> persist in the environment because many of them are not reactive towards light, acids, bases and oxygen. The color of the material becomes permanent.|$|R
50|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a technique}} whereby certain molecules can be excited with one wavelength of light and will emit another longer wavelength of light. Because each fluorescent molecule has a unique spectrum of absorption and emission, the location of particular types of molecules can be determined. Natural lipids do not fluoresce, so it is always necessary to include a <b>dye</b> <b>molecule</b> in order to study lipid bilayers with fluorescence microscopy. To some extent, {{the addition of the}} <b>dye</b> <b>molecule</b> always changes the system, and in some cases {{it can be difficult to}} say whether the observed effect is due to the lipids, the dye or, most commonly, some combination of the two. The dye is usually attached either to a lipid or a molecule that closely resembles a lipid, but since the dye domain is relatively large it can alter the behavior of this other molecule. This is a particularly contentious issue when studying the diffusion or phase separation of lipids, as both processes are very sensitive to the size and shape of the molecules involved.|$|E
50|$|Within the STED {{microscopy}} (STimulated Emission Depletion microscopy) {{a fluorescent}} <b>dye</b> <b>molecule</b> is driven between its electronic ground {{state and its}} excited state while sending out fluorescence photons. This is the standard operation mode in fluorescence microscopy and depicts state A. In state B the dye is permanently kept in its electronic ground state through stimulated emission. If the dye can fluoresce in state A and not in state B, the RESOLFT concept applies.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of glow-in-the-dark materials do not glow by phosphorescence. For example, glow sticks glow {{due to a}} chemiluminescent process which is commonly mistaken for phosphorescence. In chemiluminescence, an excited state is created via a chemical reaction. The light emission tracks the kinetic progress of the underlying chemical reaction. The excited state will then transfer to a <b>dye</b> <b>molecule,</b> {{also known as a}} sensitizer or fluorophor, and subsequently fluoresce back to the ground state.|$|E
30|$|In summary, two {{adsorbents}} including BiOCl and Fe/BiOCl {{were prepared}} {{for the removal of}} cationic and anionic dyes with low concentration from the solutions. After grafting Fe 3 + on the surface of BiOCl, the adsorbent showed more open porous structure and higher specific surface area. Both BiOCl and Fe/BiOCl are more favorable for removing the cationic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> from the solution, whereas Fe/BiOCl displays higher adsorption capacity toward anionic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> than BiOCl. Furthermore, BiOCl exhibited higher selective adsorption efficiency toward cationic <b>dye</b> <b>molecules</b> than Fe/BiOCl in mixed dye solutions. The prominent adsorption efficiency is probably to provide a potential application for as-prepared adsorbents in actual industrial wastewater.|$|R

50|$|At low temperatures, {{the mixture}} is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the leuco dye by causing the lactone ring {{in the center of}} the <b>dye</b> <b>molecule</b> to open. At high temperatures, above 24-27 °C, the solvent melts and the {{ammonium}} salt dissociates, allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the pH, which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (leuco) form.|$|E
