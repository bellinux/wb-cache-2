5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
500|$|... "One of These Days" [...] was {{developed}} around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. [...] The bass line {{was performed by}} Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. [...] Drummer Nick Mason's abstruse [...] "One of these days I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> you into little pieces" [...] line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed.|$|E
500|$|While {{there are}} {{variations}} on the BLT, the essential ingredients are bacon, tomatoes and lettuce, on a slice of bread. The {{quantity and quality of}} the ingredients are matters of personal preference. The bacon can be well cooked or tender, but as it [...] "carries" [...] the other flavours, chefs recommend using higher quality meat; in particular, chef Edward Lee states [...] "Your general supermarket bacon is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the mustard." ...|$|E

5000|$|The famous [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] scene, {{in which}} the {{characters}} dance in the queue at the job centre, was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> from the final production as it was [...] "too unrealistic".|$|R
500|$|In the {{previous}} {{book in the}} series, Midnight, StarClan, the warrior cats' ancestors, sent four cats (one from each Clan—Brambleclaw, Crowpaw, Feathertail, and Tawnypelt) on a quest. Squirrelpaw and Stormfur went with them. At {{the end of their}} journey, they arrived at the ocean and found an unusually intelligent badger named Midnight. Midnight told the cats that the Clans would have to leave their forest home and find a new place to live, as humans were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> down the forest and build a new [...] "Thunderpath" [...] (the cats' word for a road).|$|E
500|$|The Mercedes storyline was {{met with}} widely {{divergent}} reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks. In addition to Urban, many reviewers were unhappy {{with the return of}} the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including Bell, who lamented that it had [...] "been done every season". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first [...] "booty camp" [...] scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting [...] "wildly out of character" [...] in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, [...] "When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> her slack for a bad week?" [...] Canning agreed, and wrote: [...] "Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field", and felt it added to the [...] "inconsistency of these characters", even though [...] "it ultimately made sense" [...] in the context of setup for [...] "It's All Over". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story [...] "turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it [...] "the best part of the episode": it was [...] "all about how she now feels appreciated—because she has a boyfriend, sigh—and so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alan Greenspan, the {{chairman}} of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. What he's suggesting, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform. But if you've just said, you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve? ...|$|E

40|$|RDA's spend around £ 1. 5 bn per year. Administration {{accounts}} for about 7 % of this. The Homes and Communities Agency is budgeted to spend £ 6 bn this financial year. Administration {{accounts for}} less than 2 %. It should be clear that efficiency savings in the delivery (e. g. through abolishing these quangos) will only make a small difference to the overall expenditure. The new government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> programme expenditure. So the crucial question is: what should it cut...|$|R

2500|$|In August, {{a federal}} judge in San Jose {{announced}} that he was considering issuing an order postponing the recall election. [...] Activists in Monterey County had filed suit, claiming that Monterey County, and other counties of California affected by the Voting Rights Act were violating the act by announcing that, because of budgetary constraints, they were planning on hiring fewer Spanish-speaking poll watchers, and were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> back by almost half the number of polling places. [...] On September 5, a three-member panel of federal judges ruled that the county's election plans did not constitute a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act.|$|E
2500|$|Police arrested Lambert, Yunkin, and Lambert's friend Tabitha Buck {{at a local}} {{bowling alley}} later that day {{for the murder of}} Show. Initially testimonies from the three showed that Yunkin had dropped Lambert and Buck off at Show's house, where the two girls murdered Show. [...] Yunkin stated that he had not participated in the murder. Yunkin stated that while he was under the {{impression}} that Lambert and Buck were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Show's hair with the knife as a prank, he did help provide an alibi and helped to dispose of evidence. This testimony would later change as Lambert and Buck both recanted their initial testimonies, with Lambert stating that an abusive Yunkin had encouraged her to harass and assault Show.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Clinton {{voted against}} the two major tax cuts {{packages}} introduced by President Bush, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, saying it was fiscally irresponsible to reopen the budget deficit. At the 2000 Democratic National Convention, Clinton had called for maintaining a budget surplus to pay down the national debt for future generations. At a fundraiser in 2004, she told a crowd of financial donors that [...] "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you" [...] but that [...] "We're saying that for America {{to get back on}} track, we're probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good." ...|$|E

2500|$|The deal {{generated}} controversy after Canadian channel TSN {{had announced}} that the trade was complete, then claimed that the Flames had balked at completing the deal, believing they would need their players for a scheduled game. Consequently, Jokinen appeared in his final game with the Flames knowing through the media {{that he was to}} be traded afterward. When the trade was officially made, Jokinen bluntly described his feelings on the deal: [...] "It’s a brutal business. That’s the way it goes. It comes with the salary. When you make $5 million, 11 goals is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it. ... It’s definitely {{a slap in the face}} to get traded." [...] Jokinen scored 15 points in 21 games with the Rangers. In the final game of the season, New York faced the Philadelphia Flyers with the winner qualifying for the final playoff spot. Regulation time ended with the two teams tied, and the game ultimately went to a shootout. Jokinen came up as the Rangers' final shooter, with Philadelphia leading by one goal. His shot was stopped by Brian Boucher, ending their season.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E

5000|$|On March 2, 2013, {{during the}} opening {{monologue}} on Saturday Night Live, Jay Pharoah parodied President Barack Obama giving a press conference about the recent budget cuts in Congress, saying that there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>cuts</b> on the military, social service workers, federal construction projects, and Native American funding. The representatives {{of each of the}} four Village People characters did the arm dance in order after Pharaoh recited the appropriate verse of the song.|$|R

5|$|The co-producer of the film, Irving Saraf, also {{alluded to}} 30 extra minutes of unaired footage, {{including}} content filmed in the Black Cat Bar. This extra footage {{has not been}} recovered. Production correspondence written from March to July 1961 between KQED's Program Manager Jonathan Rice and NET's Director of TV Programming Donley F. Feddersen refer to scenes featuring the bar and its owner Sol Stouman that had been shot but were probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> from the final edit. These documents were preserved by the Wisconsin Historical Society.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} {{of this new}} station, has created lots of arguments and problems. Because the station is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be built in {{the southwest corner of}} the park, a lot of residents of the neighbourhood have complained about it. The main point of the argument, was that the %30 of the park was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> disappear because of this construction. It is true that the town hall said that some of the trees which were affected by the construction (104 from 348 which are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>cut)</b> would be planted during and after the construction. However, as most of the residents of the neighbourhood have seen, three of the trees planted, have died and the other 10 are in a very bad quality.|$|R
50|$|An old tree is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>cut</b> {{down and}} Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) is really {{upset about it}} since that tree {{means a lot to}} him.

Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) is not thrilled with this idea and he is trying to get him down but when Cameron has to leave and go to the theater after an {{emergency}} call, Mitchell is the one who ends up sitting on the tree. At the end of the day, they manage to save the tree and Cameron makes it on the newspaper.|$|R

Cawley lived {{initially}} in Oxford, and later in Southampton, and, when an epidemic broke out in Southampton, the Austen sisters returned to Steventon. Between 1785 and 1786 the sisters attended the Reading Ladies boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. Jane was originally not to go, as she {{was considered to be}} too young for schooling, but ended up going along with Cassandra.
