2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> feel lonely {{without us}} all, now, after coming to know us so well.|$|E
60|$|Such {{is the way}} {{the thing}} was done. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have done the same under the circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Bessie (As if {{unable to}} keep back the words). <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have noticed my voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> know a girl's {{name when}} you heard it. Butterflyflutterby was the Prince and Flutterbybutterfly was the Princess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{journey to}} Ostend, with the {{prospect}} of finding a good-natured clergyman in the town! <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be fool enough for that." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} {{have told me}} when we were married: {{it would have been}} a convenient weapon to break me in with.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Mademoiselle, {{that you}} are not proposing to {{introduce}} sentimentality. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be better advised to leave that vulgarity to the vulgar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Will! No; {{it is not}} Will. It is Frederic Aylmer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> prefer him as a {{son-in-law}} even to {{my cousin}} Will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; on {{the whole}} <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do better to pass your examination. I have heard Mr. Farebrother say it is disgracefully easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is my wife's {{oldest and}} dearest friend. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Romayne, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> feel {{interested}} in Stella, {{if you saw}} more of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They tell me of doings {{at their}} parties that are what I should not like for our little girls, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> Felix.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well;--that {{might come}} after a time. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have the feeling}} of the {{community}} with you if you succeeded;--well, not violence, you understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At length Larrinaga {{pushed back}} his chair. [...] "Time goes and my duties begin at sunrise. Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{like to make}} an early start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{certainly}} wonderful, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be more durable and steady on your legs {{if you were}} made of tin. Would you like me to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{remember}} any thing but natural history," [...] and Mr. Bhaer tapped {{gently on the}} table as applause for his pupil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Merely that {{perfunctory}} air {{of so many}} of your disquisitions. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{feel the}} want yourself. Your readers all feel it for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I wasn't {{asking for}} that; I am {{going back to}} Lottie. But <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like the air. Won't it do you good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know papa {{would like}} to have me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be less {{hampered}} in what you will have to do now if I'm not here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} underrate him," [...] said Flora steadily; [...] "but, of course, if you dislike it--though, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{change your mind}} if you knew him better--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} to hear it. Though if you had quite {{understood}} my whole meaning at first, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have refused. Do you think you would?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There now, <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{care when}} <b>I</b> told you of a soldier, a Waterloo man too, and you only {{call him a}} half-pay officer!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{may make}} your mind quite at ease," [...] the lawyer assured him. [...] "In the first place, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever be indicted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] {{said the}} mate. [...] "I don’t deceive you. I didn’t stay {{down there to}} do no restoring, and <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{you would}} be captain and all hands, if that would be any gratification; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> soon weary of your government, {{and be ready to}} abdicate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You haven't seen it. It is chiefly rose red, then blue, a metallic, mid-blue, and a {{very soft}} dark blue. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like it. Do you think you would?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{something}} to be thankful for, though it doesn't content me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be sorry for any one, even an enemy, who was in trouble and getting hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, mamma," [...] said Lily. [...] "As for me, I {{confess to}} a longing after mutton chops; but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever want such vulgar things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. For instance, if {{you were}} to become {{absolutely}} discredited, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be effectually out of my way. Your people do not forgive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] she said, [...] "my little {{visit to}} Paris {{was not so}} wild. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever have found out about Anne but for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] I said; [...] "but still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be wise to}} {{get home}} as soon as you can, and settle down to a quiet life for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arthur," [...] {{she spoke}} at last, [...] "if {{you could have}} known how anxiously I {{have been waiting for}} you since yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> in mercy have come a little sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't Arrowdale {{near your}} aunts' {{place in the}} North?" [...] she said. [...] "There's {{a picture of the}} hills round it that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like. Ask Colonel Challoner to show it you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Luigi, you are unreasonable; {{you know}} very well they couldn't baptize him dry. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be willing to undergo a little {{inconvenience}} for your brother's sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If not,' said Cilla, 'it {{is because}} you are too {{innocent}} to know flirting when you see it! Dear Mrs. Prendergast, <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have looked so grave.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} would--not if {{you promise to}} turn over a new leaf. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> rather go home than remain {{where you have to}} work for nothing." ...|$|R
