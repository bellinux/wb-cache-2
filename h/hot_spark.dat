In June, the colt was sent to England to contest the King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot. A week before the race he had been sold for an undisclosed sum to the South African owner-breeder Mrs A Hausmann. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin he started odds of 9/2 in a field which included Bay Express, <b>Hot</b> <b>Spark</b> (Flying Childers Stakes, Palace House Stakes), Auction Ring (July Stakes, King George Stakes) and Princesse Lee. Flirting Around tracked Bay Express {{for three and a}} half furlongs before accelerating into the lead and drawing away to win by five lengths from <b>Hot</b> <b>Spark,</b> Auction Ring and Willy Willy.

In the King George Stakes at Goodwood, he appeared to be an unlucky loser. He led for most of the way and looked likely to win before stumbling fifty yards from the finish and finished third, half a length and a short head by Auction Ring and <b>Hot</b> <b>Spark.</b> At York in August, Bay Express started at odds of 100/30 for the Nunthorpe Stakes in which his opponents included <b>Hot</b> <b>Spark,</b> Auction Ring and Roman Warrior, and in which he was ridden for the first time by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Carson sent him into the lead from the start and he was never looked in any danger of defeat, winning by a length and a half from the Irish filly Willy Willy, with Polly Peachum third and Roman Warrior fourth. On his final appearance, Bay Express was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October.

40|$|The {{quest for}} the {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) ignition is a grand challenge, as exemplified by extraordinary large laser facilities. Fast isochoric heating of a pre-compressed plasma core with a high-intensity short-pulse laser is an attractive and alternative approach to create ultra-high-energy-density states like those found in ICF ignition sparks. This avoids the ignition quench caused by the <b>hot</b> <b>spark</b> mixing with the surrounding cold fuel, which is the crucial problem of the currently pursued ignition scheme. High-intensity lasers efficiently produce relativistic electron beams (REB). A part of the REB kinetic energy is deposited in the core, and then the heated region becomes the <b>hot</b> <b>spark</b> to trigger the ignition. However, {{only a small portion}} of the REB collides with the core because of its large divergence. Here we have demonstrated enhanced laser-to-core energy coupling with the magnetized fast isochoric heating. The method employs a kilo-tesla-level magnetic field that is applied to the transport region from the REB generation point to the core which results in guiding the REB along the magnetic field lines to the core. 7. 7 ± 1. 3...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{isobaric}} {{models for}} inertial confinement fusion {{it is assumed}} that the target configuration at stagnation time (maximum compression) consists of two regions, <b>hot</b> <b>spark</b> and cold fuel, respectively. Here the conditions of spark formation and ignition in hydrogen equimolar isotopes in central spark ignition are investigated and permissible values of Hs and Ts are evaluated numerically. By introducing a dimensionless parameter, ψs, the class of targets are considered by the specific value of ψs. Finally, limiting fuel energy gain curve (Gf*) as a function of ignition energy (Eign) allows different implosion velocities to be calculated. This result is in good agreement with more complex hydrodynamic models...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} laser fusion {{implosion}} experiments of plastic hollow shell targets {{was performed by}} using the Gekko XII glass laser {{in order to achieve}} the required fuel areal density for ignition. Introducing random phase plates to improve illumination uniformity, high-density compression of more than 600 times deuterium liquid density has been achieved. The implosion dynamics and symmetry were observed with a spatially resolved x-ray streak camera and an x-ray multiframing camera. The three-dimensional emission profile of the laser-heated plasma was reconstructed from the x-ray images by use of computed tomography and was compared with the laser illumination profiles. The areal density of the imploded core was measured by the neutron activation of a silicon tracer, the secondary reaction method, and the knock-on proton method. Although the measured density and areal density were consistent with those from 1 -D hydrodynamic simulation, experimental neutron yields were significantly lower than those predicted by the simulation for convergence ratios larger than 20. This suggests that better implosion uniformity is required to create a <b>hot</b> <b>spark...</b>|$|E
40|$|Direct-drive {{implosion}} {{experiments on}} the GEKKO XII laser (9 kJ, 0. 5 μm, 2 ns) with deuterium and tritium (DT) exchanged plastic hollow shell targets demonstrated fuel areal densities (ρR) of approximately 0. 1 g/cm 2 and fuel densities of approximately 600 times liquid density at fuel temperatures of approximately 0. 3 keV. (The density and ρR values refer only to DT {{and do not}} include carbons in the plastic targets.) These values are to be compared with thermonuclear ignition conditions, i. e., fuel densities of 500 - 1000 times liquid density, fuel areal densities greater than 0. 3 g/cm 2, and fuel temperatures greater than 5 keV. The irradiation nonuniformity in these experiments was significantly reduced {{to a level of}} < 5 % in root mean square by introducing random-phase plates. The target irregularity was controlled to a 1 % level. The fuel ρR was directly measured with the neutron activation of Si, which was originally compounded in the plastic targets. The fuel densities were estimated from the ρR values using the mass conservation relation, where the ablated mass was separately measured using the time-dependent X-ray emission from multilayer targets. Although the observed densities were in agreement with one-dimensional calculation results with convergence ratios of 25 - 30, the observed neutron yields were significantly lower than those of the calculations.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{that govern the}} formation, existence and consumption of ions in gases have been studied both experimentally and theoretically. The aim {{of the work is}} targeted at increasing the understanding of these phenomena in the working gases inside an engine. Both the cause and the application of ionized gases inside the cylinder of a spark ignited (SI) engine has been studied. The spark discharge process that eventually leads to a favorable combustion has been studied {{in order to determine the}} total amount of energy that enters the gas. A simplified theoretical model has been developed that includes the most dominant effects. The model includes molecular and atomic processes such as ionization, dissociation and thermal heating together with diffusion of cold gas molecules into the <b>hot</b> <b>spark</b> kernel. The energy input is then calculated from the electrical properties of the ignition system and the gas conditions between the electrodes. Electrode effects have not been included since the energy released close to the electrodes to a major extent is lost. In order to gain even more knowledge about the dynamic spark behavior, a hydrodynamic model for the description of the generated flow patterns emanating from a fast spark discharge was used. In addition, a detailed model for the generation of initial breakdown conditions was also used. The experimental techniques that have been used to support the model have been various, e. g. electrical power measurements, calorimetric measurements and interferometric measurements. The spark, that has been intensively studied, inflames a small region of gas in the vicinity of the electrode gap. This flame kernel will then develop into a propagating flame. While growing, the high gas temperature close to the spark gap reflects the progress of the combustion process. This fact has been used for engine diagnostics by measuring the current flowing through the spark plug gap. The phenomenon has been described in a model for flame ionization in order to deduce the cylinder pressure and the air/fuel ratio in vicinity of spark plug. There are mainly three contributing parameters, which are required for a correct description of the current namely; the ion/electron concentrations, the electric field distribution in space and the drift velocity of the electrons. It has been shown that the current is carried by the electrons to a higher extent than the ions although the electrons are easily attached to electronegative species, such as oxygen (O) and the hydroxyl radical (OH). A detailed chemical kinetic code has been used in order to calculate the concentrations of the most significant species in both the reaction zone and the postflame region. In addition to the theoretical work a large amount of experimental data has been collected for the purpose of model validation and obtaining a deeper understanding. Statistical treatment of the experimental data has also been performed. By this method the influence from some additional parameters such as the amount of EGR and variable fuels have been investigated...|$|E

40|$|Application of {{relativity}} formulas for x-ray doublets to ultra-violet spectra. — Evidence {{has been presented}} which indicates {{that many of the}} strongest lines in <b>hot</b> <b>spark</b> spectra are due to atoms stripped of all valence electrons excepting the one which in jumping between energy levels emits the radiation. For the L doublets due to atoms with but one L electron, Li(+), Be(2 +), B(3 +), C(4 +), it is found that the frequency difference varies with atomic number Z in accordance with the relativity formula for x-ray doublets Δν=K(Z-s) 4, the constant K being. 365 for the regular L series, and the screening constant s decreasing from 2. 02 for Li(+) to 1. 86 for C(4 +). Other L doublets are attributed to atoms stripped of all but three L electrons, the same formula holding but giving values of s about 20 per cent greater. In the case of triplets, the frequency differences of the widest pairs give values of s for atoms stripped of all but two or four L electrons which agree well with values for only one, three or five L electrons, though tending to be somewhat greater. Similarly from M doublets and triplets (K=. 108) of C and N, values of s were obtained for atoms with from one to three L electrons slightly greater than from the corresponding L lines. In the case of atoms with only one M electron, the values of s decrease from 7. 45 for Na(+) to 5. 74 for P(5 +), corresponding values of s from N, O and P series of doublets being slightly larger; for atoms with only two M electrons (widest pair of triplets) and with only three M electrons (doublets) the values of s vary up to about 9. For doublets corresponding to outer transitions 3 d 2 - 3 d 1, 4 d 2 - 4 d 1 and 4 f 2 - 4 f 1 the values of s come out close to 10. In the case of irregular L and M doublets corresponding to transitions from the 2 s and 3 s levels, the law for corresponding x-ray doublets also holds, the differences (sqrt[νs]-sqrt[νp]) increasing regularly and not very greatly with Z. All these facts are shown to agree well with what should be expected according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory; and the values of s give quantitatively the influence upon the effective nuclear charge of the addition of electrons in the valence shells. New series terms. The above relations enable the value of s for a given series for a given ionized atom to be predicted, and led to the discovery of an L doublet at λ 1240 due to N(5 +), and to the assignment of the following L doublets: λ 990 to N(3 +), λ 1493 and 1744 to N(+), λ 789 and λ 658 to O(4 +), and λ 922 to O(2 +). These results give us a new method of predicting spectra and of determining the state of ionization of atoms emitting certain lines.
