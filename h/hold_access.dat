40|$|Modern cities {{contain a}} wealth of {{information}} that is usually scattered among a myriad of organisms. For citizens it is many times difficult and confusing to access this information. Cities {{must find a way to}} put all this information at the disposal not only of the citizens but any employee that takes part in the operation and maintenance of the city. One of the problems that appear is that each city department has organized its information independently of others, thus leading to an heterogeneous ecosystem of databases and platforms. This paper describes a solution to access all the information available in a city through a mobile platform. A customizable user application for the Android operating system is described. The solution can be deployed in any city as the application dynamically obtains the information from remote servers that <b>hold</b> <b>access</b> to the databases. Universidad de Málaga.

The effect of firm-specific uncertainty on R&D investment is smaller in concentrated markets – those where strategic rivalry is more intense. Furthermore, <b>holding</b> <b>access</b> to financing constant, the effect of uncertainty on R&D investment is attenuated for large firms. Keywords...|$|R

30|$|Additionally, the {{extraction}} system, acting {{on behalf of}} a particular user, can access all files the user <b>holds</b> <b>access</b> rights for. Thus, it can, for instance, lift entity mentions, i.e. mentions of persons, places etc. onto a semantically unambiguous level, linking e.g. different writings of a name or even different names for the same thing or person. This allows, for instance, to trace a particular semantic entity in different contexts without the need for expert users who know all possible ways the semantic entity could be addressed in these contexts. This also allows for interdisciplinary work, linking sources of different research communities. For instance, places or persons occurring in literary texts could be linked with information retrieved from historical or geological information sources. This use-case and the interaction between the high-level extraction services with the resource federation component is described in section 5.|$|R

50|$|The Chokepoint {{project was}} {{established}} in 2011 following the Internet blackouts in Egypt and Libya. The internet blackouts inspired {{two members of the}} P2P Foundation, James Burke and Chris Pinchen, to create the Chokepoint Project. The project's aim is to create a live visual map of the internet that identifies Chokepoints and people <b>holding</b> <b>access</b> to these Chokepoints. Chokepoints are defined as points of Internet access vulnerability. This map would potentially allow people to identify the degree and precise location of internet outages. Much of the data used for the mapping is supplied by volunteers. The Chokepoint project also works to dispel the assumption that the internet is a decentralized medium that is not subject to government power. For those who are subject to internet blackouts, the Chokepoint projects also provides methods of circumventing these chokepoints and information on legal matters regarding the internet blackouts. The Chokepoint project was awarded the Prix Arts Electronica in May 2011 in the Next Idea category.|$|R

40|$|A novel LEO/MEO two-tier {{satellite}} communication system with inter-satellite links (ISLs) is proposed for providing multimedia services to global mobile users. This two-tier system architecture {{can reduce the}} transmission delay for long-distance users via MEO satellites while keeping the benefits of using LEO satellites as the service access nodes. The routing and re-routing during a handoff operation is simplified. Since the physical topology of the underlying network is time-dependent, routing is crucial for guaranteeing the delay and delay variation performance for interactive applications. We decompose the routing problem into two parts, routing in the access network and routing in the core MEO ISL network. For the access network, a new routing algorithm called the maximum <b>holding</b> <b>access</b> protocol (MHAP) is proposed for minimizing the number of LEO handoffs. For core MEO ISL network, both minimum transmission delay routing (MTDR) and minimum transmission time jitter routing (MTTJR) are investigated. Using computer simulations, we show that the proposed routing algorithms can reduce the probability of call re-routing and thus are very suitable for providing interactive multimedia services. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the important factors that influence both adoption and level of use of organic fertilizer among smallholder farmers in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia using a primary data collected from 161 sample respondents. An independent double hurdle model was used to address the objectives of the study on the assumption that adoption and level of organic fertilizer use by are two independent decisions influenced by different factors. Empirical estimates of the first hurdle reveals that literacy status of the head, livestock holding, frequency of extension contact, distance to market and slope of the plot are statistically significant decision variables that affect the probability of adopting organic fertilizer. Meanwhile, estimates of the second hurdle revealed that, the extent of use of organic fertilizer was determined by livestock <b>holding,</b> <b>access</b> to credit distance to the market and slope of plot. This indicates that factors that affect adoption are not necessarily the same as those that influence intensity. Therefore, it is important to consider both stages in evaluating strategies aimed at promoting the adoption and use of organic fertilizer...|$|R

30|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{perception}} of historic changes in climate and associated impact on local agriculture among smallholders in pastoral/agropastoral systems of Borana in southern Ethiopia. We drew on empirical data obtained from farm household surveys conducted in 5 districts, 20 pastoral/agropastoral associations and 480 farm households. Using this data, this study analyses smallholders’ perception of climate change and its associated impact on local agriculture, {{and the effect of}} various household and farm attributes on perception. Results suggest that most participants perceived climatic change and its negative impact on agricultural and considered climate change as a salient risk to their future livelihoods and economic development. Different levels of perception were expressed in terms of climate change and the impact on traditional rain-fed agriculture. Age, education level, livestock <b>holding,</b> <b>access</b> to climate information and extension services significantly affected perception levels. Household size, production system, farm and non-farm incomes did not significantly affect perception levels of smallholders. Smallholders attributed climate change to a range of biophysical, deistic and anthropogenic causes. Increased access to agricultural support services, which improves the availability and the quality of relevant climate information will further enhance awareness of climate change within of the rural community and result in better management of climate-induced risks in these vulnerable agricultural systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of land tenure security is widespread in Uganda. This {{is one of}} the findings from an empirical analysis of the relationship between land tenure form, tenure documentation, economic behaviour and perceived tenure security for different types of land holders in the Amuru, Masaka and Pallisa areas in Uganda undertaken by researchers from DIIS and from Makerere University. This DIIS Working Paper presents the result of this analysis. Land tenure is, however, under transition in Uganda. Despite the widespread {{perception of}} security in land tenure, the study finds that land tenure insecurity is associated with the co-existence of different tenure forms rather than with any tenure form in particular and that context and resource endowments of the individual are important constituents of tenure security. Thus, in order to maintain, deepen and widen the currently widespread perception of tenure security, great care is needed in the design and implementation of ongoing policy and institutional interventions with respect to land administration in Uganda. The DIIS Working Paper forms part of a study on Land and Property rights and Economic Behaviour commissioned to DIIS by the Royal Danish Embassy in Uganda. It is informed by {{a review of the literature}} on land tenure and economic activities in Uganda and based upon qualitative interviews undertaken with different types of actors in Amuru, Masaka and Pallisa areas and upon a questionnaire survey administered to a total of 1, 200 respondents <b>holding</b> <b>access</b> to land in the three areas...|$|R

Also, rights sharing between clients does not compromise their non-shared rights when a sound public-key cryptosystem is used.

However, only control on partial rights transfers is addressed in this paper, which does not deal with total identity transfer or alienation...|$|R

Impact of {{irrigation}} on poverty and environment in Ethiopia: draft {{proceedings of the}} symposium and exhibition, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 27 - 29 November 2007. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The study examined the extent and nature of market oriented production in irrigated compared to rainfed systems in Ethiopia. By doing so the paper identifies the role {{of irrigation}} in market-oriented production, {{while at the same}} time highlighting the main constraints to market oriented development. Our results indicate that irrigation contributes significantly to increases in market participation, volume of marketed produce and, hence, income, by inducing shifts in farmers? cropping mix. The impact of commercialization of production on household food security is not direct and immediate mainly because of failures in the food market. While irrigation enhances market production, there are series of factors that pose serious constraints to market production. Land size, oxen <b>holding,</b> <b>access</b> to market and means of transport were found to be important determinants of market oriented production calling for policy interventions in land markets, access to productive assets and infrastructure development and policy measures to improve the performance of agricultural markets. The study also found education has market promoting effect in terms of increasing the probability of participation and volume of sale. Increased support to education can, thus, help in the long-term to transform traditional subsistence agriculture into more market-oriented agriculture. Finally there are unobserved site specific effects, related to location and other covariates, which influence market participation and volume decisions...|$|R
