5|$|Goofus and Gallant {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According to family legend, the grandchildren of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and Gallant {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant turned from elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists <b>have</b> <b>drawn</b> for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>have</b> <b>drawn</b> on a {{range of}} sources on Henry, {{including}} the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early pipe rolls; and surviving buildings and architecture. The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive social and moral commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works. Other chroniclers include Eadmer, Hugh the Chanter, Abbot Suger, and the authors of the Welsh Brut. Not all royal documents from the period have survived, but {{there are a number of}} royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records. Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or tampered with.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs <b>have</b> <b>drawn</b> much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species.

In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E

To that end, they have been compared to Mould's previous work {{as a member of}} Sugar and Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal Diary and Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material toward more guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with Mouthfeel returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E
