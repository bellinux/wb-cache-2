25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E

Note too, that Hippeastrum can also be grown in the ground in temperate areas. Bulbs are usually sold in fall for early winter bloom. [...] Bare-root bulbs do best planted in a pot only slightly larger than the circumference of the bulb in well-drained, organic mix (such as sterilized potting soil plus coir fiber, or equal amounts of peat moss, sand and humus), with {{one third of the}} bulb visible above the surface of the soil and two thirds buried.|$|E

[...] Isherwood described the Off-Broadway play as a [...] "show about matters {{of the heart and}} matters of the closet" [...] in The New York Times. In Variety, Marilyn Stasio called it [...] "a bittersweet meditation on the joys and tribulations of women's lives, reflected through the prism of their clothes". In Bloomberg News, the critics commented that the playwrights were [...] "literary alchemists expert at mixing the sentimental and the satirical and turning out something poignant" [...] and noted that the clothing and accessories dominated the memories while [...] "The men are extras." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the show as a cross between The Vagina Monologues and What Not to Wear. Helen Shaw, writing for Time Out, also described the Ephrons' style as similar to The Vagina Monologuess' Eve Ensler. [...] Jay Reiner of The Hollywood Reporter also notes that from the work [...] "a tapestry of the collective female psyche emerges that <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> insightful without being sentimental". TheaterMania.com, Inc. describes the show as [...] "So insightful and entertaining is this survey of sartorial preoccupations and the deeper questions underlying them that multiple viewings would be advisable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Before {{the week}} ended, {{it was all}} disappointment. In the first place, William was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed, and he was sailed within four days from their {{reaching}} Portsmouth; and during those days {{she had seen him}} only twice, in a short and hurried way, when he had come ashore on duty. There had been no free conversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no acquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and depended on. Everything in that quarter failed her, except William's affection. His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped back again to the door to say, [...] "Take care of Fanny, mother.

[...] The botanists say, [...] "The leaf is an {{expansion}} of the bark of the stem." [...] More accurately, the bark is a contraction of the tissue of the leaf. For every leaf is born out of the earth, and breathes out of the air; and there are many leaves that have no stems, but only roots. It is 'the springing thing'; this thin film of life; rising, with its edge out of the ground--infinitely feeble, infinitely fair. With Folium, in Latin, is rightly associated the word Flos; for the flower is only a group of {42} singularly happy leaves. From these two roots come foglio, feuille, feuillage, and fleur;--blume, blossom, and bloom; our foliage, and the borrowed foil, and the connected technical groups of words in architecture and the sciences.|$|E

Yielding to temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world. It has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit. Jack just cannot keep away from the crops planted by men. His family is very large, and when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat, or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> sweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed for becoming angry and seeking to kill them. Yes, I am sorry to say, Jack Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where he has no business. Now I guess you have learned sufficient about your long-legged cousins.

Some men can reveal their cause to their lawyers better than some, and are more serviceable and handy in that affair than others. But, saith the Christian, I am dull and stupid that way, will not Christ be shuff13 and shy with me because of this? Honest heart! He hath a supply of thy defects14 in himself, and knoweth what thou wantest, and where the shoe pinches, though thou art not able distinctly to open matters to him. The child is pricked with a pin, and lies crying in the mother's lap, but cannot show its mother where the pin is; but there is pity enough in the mother to supply this defect of the child; wherefore she undresses it, opens it, searches every clout from head {{to the foot of}} the child, and so finds where the pin is. Thus will thy lawyer do; he will search and find out thy difficulties, and where Satan seeketh an advantage of thee, accordingly will provide his remedy.|$|E

60|$|The {{stage in}} Shakespeareâ€™s {{time was a}} naked room with a blanket for a curtain; but he made it a field for monarchs. That law of unity, which has its foundations, not in the {{factitious}} necessity of custom, but in nature itself, the unity of feeling, is everywhere and at all times observed by Shakespeare in his plays. Read Romeo and Juliet;â€”all is youth and spring;â€”youth with its follies, its virtues, its precipitancies;â€”spring with its odours, its flowers, and its transiency; it is {{one and the same}} feeling that commences, goes through, and ends the play. The old men, the Capulets and Montagues, are not common old men; they have an eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect of spring; with Romeo, his change of passion, his sudden marriage, and his rash death, are all the effects of youth;â€”whilst in Juliet love has all that <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> melancholy in the nightingale, all that is voluptuous in the rose, with whatever is sweet in the freshness of spring; but it ends with a long deep sigh like the last breeze of the Italian evening. This unity of feeling and character pervades every drama of Shakespeare.|$|E
6000|$|True, {{the best}} part of him, perhaps almost all the good part of him, spent itself in words, and must be looked for, not in his life, but in his books. But in those books it can be found; and if you look through them, you will see that he has not touched upon a subject without taking, on the whole, the right, and pure, and lofty view of it. Howsoever extravagant he may be in his notions of poetic licence, that licence is never with him a synonym for licentiousness. Whatever <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> true, {{whatever}} is chivalrous and high-minded, he loves at first sight, and reproduces it lovingly. And it may be possible that his own estimate of his poems was not altogether wrong; that his words may have awakened here and there in others a love for that which is morally as well as physically beautiful, and may have kept alive in their hearts the recollection that, both for the bodies and the souls of men forms of life far nobler and fairer than those which we see now are possible; that they have appeared, in fragments at least, already on the earth; that they are destined, perhaps, to reappear and combine themselves in some ideal state, and in ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} so sympathetic, so appreciative, {{in the sound}} of Grace's voice, that it impelled people to play havoc with their customary reservations in talking to her. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>tender</b> <b>and</b> kind of you to feel that," [...] said Mrs. Charmond. [...] "Perhaps I have given you the notion that my languor is more than it really is.

I have often thought of writing a 'New Sentimental Journey.' But I cannot find energy enough to do it alone. When I am at different places in the south of Europe I feel a crowd of ideas and fancies thronging upon me continually, but to unfold writing-materials, take up a cold steel pen, and put these impressions down systematically on cold, smooth paper--that I cannot do. So I have thought that if I always could have somebody at my elbow with whom I am in sympathy, I might dictate any ideas that come into my head. And directly I had made your acquaintance the other day it struck me that you would suit me so well. Would you like to undertake it? You might read to me, too, if desirable.
