5|$|The {{heads of}} France and the United Kingdom flew Concorde many times. Presidents Georges Pompidou, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and François Mitterrand {{regularly}} used Concorde as French <b>flagman</b> aircraft in foreign visits. Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Ministers Edward Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair took Concorde in some charter flights {{such as the}} Queen's trips to Barbados on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, in 1987 and in 2003, to Middle East in 1984 and to the United States in 1991., museum Pope John Paul II flew on Concorde in May 1989.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a <b>flagman</b> to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
25|$|In {{the report}} Fireman Sim Webb {{states that he}} heard the torpedo explode, {{then went to the}} gangway on the engineer's side and saw the <b>flagman</b> with the red and white lights {{standing}} alongside the tracks. Going to the fireman's side, he saw the markers of the caboose of No. 83 and yelled to Jones. But it would have been impossible for him to have seen the <b>flagman</b> if the <b>flagman</b> had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to believe that an engineer of Jones' experience would have ignored a <b>flagman</b> and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.|$|E

25|$|After an {{incident}} at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit <b>flagman</b> waved a green flag {{but the light}} at the end of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the <b>flagman</b> from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, {{the light at the}} end of pit road is official.|$|E

25|$|In many short tracks, the <b>flagman</b> {{gives the}} {{chequered}} flag {{to the winner}} of the race, but a variety of other celebratory traditions, such as the burnout, the Polish victory lap and the victory lane or victory circle celebration, sometimes overshadow the chequered flag tradition.|$|E
25|$|Few wigwag signals {{currently}} {{remain in}} place, though the number dwindles as crossings are upgraded and spare parts become scarce. Once broken down and sold (or given away) as scrap as modern flashers took their place, {{they are now}} railroad collectibles, commanding a hefty price and winding up in personal collections of railroad officials. Magnetic <b>Flagman</b> made in Minneapolis, Minnesota after production was moved from Los Angeles are especially rare and are valued by collectors.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Communist regime in 1990 and Georgia’s eventual re-gaining of independence, David Gamkrelidze concluded he had exhausted his function in the National Liberation Movement and moved to entrepreneurial activities. Along with his friends, he established the first ever insurance company in Georgia, the Aldagi. Very soon, Aldagi became the <b>flagman</b> of the insurance industry in Georgia. In 1999, David Gamkrelidze, as the President of Aldagi, was named among the ten most successful businessmen of Georgia.|$|E

Bondar, arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously rehabilitated.|$|E
25|$|Ristar, as a character, {{has only}} {{made a few}} minor cameo {{appearances}} outside of his two original games in 1995. In Sega's two Shenmue games for the Dreamcast, Shenmue and Shenmue II, the player can choose to spend money to purchase a randomly selected collectible 'Gachapons' (capsule toys) from a machine; one of the possibilities in both games is a Ristar figurine. He also briefly appeared introductory video of the 2001 Japan-only Dreamcast game Segagaga. Ristar did not make any more appearances until 2010, where he makes a cameo appearance in a downloadable track for Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing due to the high demand {{for him to be}} in the game. He also made an appearance as a <b>flagman</b> in the sequel, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} level {{crossings}} {{depends on the}} location, but often early level crossings had a <b>flagman</b> in a nearby booth who would, on the approach of a train, wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks. Gated crossings became commonplace in many areas, as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock, and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman. In {{the second quarter of}} the 20th century, manual or electrical closable gates that barricaded the roadway started to be introduced, intended to be a complete barrier against intrusion of any road traffic onto the railway. Automatic crossings are now commonplace in some countries as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn vehicles and the need for animal protection diminished with time. Full, half or no barrier crossings superseded gated crossings, although crossings of older types can still be found in places. New technology is advancing to create new ways of protecting the railway from users of a level crossing, {{with one of the most}} recent being obstacle detection scanners fitted to some crossings in Europe.|$|E

50|$|The Brotherhood was {{organized}} into lodges. Its executive was elected {{every four years}} at the Grand Lodge Convention, including the president. There were four governing boards: the Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and Insurance, Board of Appeals, and Executive Board. Members in rail service included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train <b>flagmen.</b> Member in yard service included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen, <b>flagmen,</b> brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car operators.|$|R

500|$|Crane {{wrote his}} first known story, [...] "Uncle Jake and the Bell Handle", {{when he was}} 14. In late 1885, he {{enrolled}} at Pennington Seminary, a ministry-focused coeducational boarding school [...] north of Trenton. His father had been principal there from 1849 to 1858. Soon after her youngest son left for school, Mrs. Crane began suffering what the Asbury Park Shore Press reported as [...] "a temporary aberration of the mind." [...] She had apparently recovered by early 1886, but later that year, her son, 23-year-old Luther Crane, died after falling {{in front of an}} oncoming train while working as a <b>flagman</b> for the Erie Railroad. It was the fourth death in six years among Stephen's immediate family.|$|E
500|$|Castroneves {{was upset}} about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the <b>flagman</b> (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued {{that he did not}} change his line: [...] "I {{actually}} gave him room outside. When you go side by side like that with your teammate and the guy [...] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd." [...] Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for unsportsmanlike conduct and was placed on probation {{for the rest of the}} season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and the Brazilian's manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of Motor Sport Magazine opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportmanslike and noted that several fans saw it as [...] "good, hard racing".|$|E

It won't happen again." ...|$|R
25|$|After these {{distinctive}} signals {{were installed}} train-versus-car collisions began decreasing at PE grade crossings. They were so common {{throughout the area}} that they became near-icons of Southern California motoring. They became popular and Magnetic Signal wigwags began appearing at railroad crossings across the United States (including Alaska on the Copper River & Northwestern Railway and several Hawaiian railroads), Canada, Mexico, and {{as far away as}} Australia. There are also photographs of Magnetic <b>Flagmen</b> in use in Europe.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Flagmen</b> of Lowestoft are a {{collection}} of thirteen paintings by Sir Peter Lely, painted in the mid-1660s. They were originally part of the Royal Collections, though most were given to Greenwich Hospital in the nineteenth century, and {{are now in the}} care of the National Maritime Museum. The paintings are of prominent naval officers, most of them of flag rank, who had fought at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665. Lely at the time was Principal Painter to King Charles II.|$|R
50|$|With {{the road}} bridge also unsafe {{for use by}} {{military}} convoys, {{it was suggested that}} decking should be constructed on the bridge to provide for a 3.5 metre wide roadway. As a result, American military convoys were able to use the bridge to cross the Fitzroy River. <b>Flagmen</b> and guards were placed {{at each end of the}} bridge, and convoys were worked around train services where up to forty trains used the bridge per day. The decking was removed in 1945.|$|R
50|$|Strawberry Plains {{is said to}} {{be named}} for the wild {{strawberries}} that grew there in abundance when white settlers from North Carolina first arrived in the area. According to a history of the community written by local high school students circa 1935, the name Straw Plains was a shorthand name used by railroad porters and <b>flagmen</b> on trains that passed through Strawberry Plains, and that came to be used as the name of the local railroad depot and on some local post office postmarks.|$|R
