5|$|Instead of copying {{traditional}} academic postures, Rodin preferred his {{models to}} move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's {{focus was on}} the handling of clay.|$|E
5|$|The {{fish and}} {{bivalves}} were found <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> {{which was probably}} a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> {{that may have been}} shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy barrier between lagoon and sea, in a setting perhaps similar to the Florida Keys or the southwestern coast of Jutland. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E

When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|Moore and Nash {{were on the}} organising {{committee}} of the International Surrealist Exhibition, {{which took place in}} London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface <b>in</b> <b>clay.</b> Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor {{from the government and}} the artistic community.|$|E

During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces <b>in</b> <b>clay.</b> Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Farmer led {{his team}} in scoring {{during the regular}} season, {{averaging}} 16.4 points per game from the shooting guard position. He also led the Tigers in scoring in each of their three games {{en route to the}} 13th Region Kentucky High School Athletic Association basketball championship. In the opening round of the 1985 KHSAA state tournament, Farmer scored 14 points on 6 of 16 shooting in a win over Boone County High School. Then, in back-to-back victories against Metcalfe County High School and Doss High School, he led his team with 21 and 20 points, respectively, to help Clay County reach the tournament finals. Farmer scored 10 points <b>in</b> <b>Clay</b> County's 6564 loss to Hopkinsville High School in the championship game. He was the tournament's second-highest scorer with 69 points, one behind Hopkinsville's Lamont Ware, and finished second in the voting for the tournament's Most Valuable Player, which went to Hopkinsville's Wendell Quarles. Only Apollo High School's Rex Chapman received more votes for the all-tournament team.|$|E

30|$|Salinization is {{a global}} problem and {{is defined as the}} {{concentration}} of soluble salts in the soil that interfere negatively with soils and the growth of plants due to a high salt content. When sodium is the prevalent cation <b>in</b> <b>clays,</b> dispersion of the soil is generated, leading to destruction of its structure. Moreover, when in a soil, the hydrolysis of sodium <b>in</b> <b>clays</b> leads to alkalization of the profile, causing intense mineral alteration and classification as a sodic soil (sometimes alkaline), but, if there is a high salt content and sodium predominates in the exchange complex, they are classified as a saline-sodic soil [1].|$|R
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{is found}} in central Queensland from {{latitude}} 22° S to 28° S, with the western limits of its range defined by the 500mm rainfall isohyet. It grows on the tops and slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country, <b>in</b> <b>clay,</b> shale, or basalt soils. It is an emergent tree in forests dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), or ooline (Cadellia pentastylis). It is always present in the Central semi-evergreen vine thicket—also known as Bottletree Scrub—of the Brigalow Belt. Other common species include broad-leaved bottle tree (Brachychiton australis) and belah (Casuarina cristata). The bottle tree is replaced by the kurrajong in similar communities in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials.

Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated <b>in</b> <b>clay.</b> Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMobility of ions {{and water}} <b>in</b> <b>clays</b> {{is at the}} heart of their {{remarkable}} properties of water retention and ion-exchange. It has been addressed here using two microscopic techniques: neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. Neutron scattering gives access exclusively to water dynamics <b>in</b> <b>clays,</b> due to the exceptional sensitivity of neutrons to H atoms. The data interpretation can be challenging, especially for natural clays such as montmorillonite, with inhomogeneous swelling characteristics. A great improvement is achieved with the use of synthetic materials, as demonstrated here on the case of synthetic (fluoro) hectorite. The standard analytical models for long-range diffusive motion, isotropic translation and its derivative, powder averaged two dimensional translation, have been used to interpret the neutron scattering data. They both agree on the order of magnitude for the diffusion coefficient of water in monohydrated and bihydrated clays, 10 − 10 m 2 s− 1 and 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 respectively. While the two-dimensional nature of water diffusion <b>in</b> <b>clays</b> is seen clearly from molecular dynamics simulations, its signature in neutron scattering data is obscured by the powder-averaging of the signal. A novel method, based on a multi-resolution analysis of scattering functions from powder samples, allows never-the-less a clear determination of the dimensionality of water motion in the system. Extracting information on local water motion is difficult on the basis of neutron scattering data only. Various models for localised motion, rotation on a sphere or jump diffusion, have been proposed and used to interpret the observed neutron data, however their applicability is questionable in light of information from molecular dynamics simulations. Aside from aiding the interpretation of neutron scattering data, MD simulations are most valuable in providing information on the behaviour of ions <b>in</b> <b>clays.</b> MD estimates the interlayer ion coefficients as of the some order of magnitude as water, even if the details of ionic motion are strikingly different between the two ions considered here, Na+ and Cs+. Further, MD has also allowed to address the topic of ion exchange between clay interlayers and bulk aqueous solution. The microscopic picture of water and ion motion <b>in</b> <b>clays,</b> emerging from neutron scattering and MD simulations, should be treated as a building block of the overall modelling of macroscopic transport <b>in</b> <b>clays,</b> the ultimate property of interest for many clay applications...|$|R

5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins <b>in</b> <b>clay</b> soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county.
