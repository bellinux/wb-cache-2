500|$|Alcoholics {{may also}} require {{treatment}} for other psychotropic drug addictions and drug dependences. The most common dual <b>dependence</b> <b>syndrome</b> with alcohol dependence is benzodiazepine dependence, with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine {{drugs such as}} valium or clonazopam. These drugs are, like alcohol, depressants. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, {{or they may be}} purchased as illegal drugs [...] "on the street" [...] through illicit channels. [...] Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers. Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as zolpidem and zopiclone as well as opiates and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of psychosis or seizures if not managed properly.|$|E

5000|$|Psychological {{dependence}} {{is a form}} {{of dependence}} that involves emotional-motivational withdrawal symptoms (e.g., a state of unease or dissatisfaction, a reduced capacity to experience pleasure, or anxiety) upon cessation of drug use or engagement in certain behaviors. Physical and psychological dependence are sometimes classified as a facet or component of addiction, such as in the DSM-IV-TR; however, some drugs which produce <b>dependence</b> <b>syndromes</b> do not produce addiction, and vice versa, in humans. Addiction and psychological dependence are both mediated through reinforcement, a form of operant conditioning, but are associated with different forms of reinforcement. [...] Addiction is a compulsion for rewarding stimuli that is mediated through positive reinforcement. Psychological dependence, which is mediated through negative reinforcement, involves a desire to use a drug or perform a behavior to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal syndrome that results from cessation of exposure to it.|$|R
2500|$|A 2005 {{review in}} CNS Drugs {{determined}} that [...] "significant psychiatric symptoms including aggression and violence, mania, and less frequently psychosis and suicide {{have been associated}} with steroid abuse. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS". High concentrations of AAS, comparable to those likely sustained by many recreational AAS users, produce apoptotic effects on neurons, raising the specter of possibly irreversible neurotoxicity. Recreational AAS use appears to be associated with a range of potentially prolonged psychiatric effects, including <b>dependence</b> <b>syndromes,</b> mood disorders, and progression to other forms of substance abuse, but the prevalence and severity of these various effects remains poorly understood. There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. Mood disturbances (e.g. depression, mania, psychotic features) are likely to be dose- and drug-dependent, but AAS dependence or withdrawal effects seem to occur only in a small number of AAS users.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Based on an {{epidemiologic}} {{field survey}} of community households in Puerto Rico, this study estimates {{the frequency of}} illicit drug use and clinically defined drug abuse and/or <b>dependence</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Results are compared with those from surveys on the United States mainland. Suspected risk factors are studied as well, with a special focus on childhood misbehavior. METHODS. Trained lay interviewers administered a Spanish Diagnostic Interview Schedule to 912 respondents aged 17 to 68 years who were selected by multistage probability sampling of island households. RESULTS. An estimated 8. 2 % of the population {{had a history of}} illicit drug use and 1. 2 % qualified for a standardized lifetime diagnosis of drug abuse, dependence, or both. An estimated 18. 4 % of the male drug users and 7. 7 % of the female drug users met criteria for drug abuse and/or dependence. A history of drug use was related to the diagnoses of alcohol abuse and/or dependence and antisocial personality, but few persons who had used illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime reported a history of receiving treatment for alcohol, drug, or mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS. The data were consistent with a suspected association between level of childhood misbehavior and occurrence of illicit drug use, even after statistical control for potentially confounding variables...|$|R

40|$|Although {{comorbidity}} among complex diseases (e. g., drug <b>dependence</b> <b>syndromes)</b> is well documented, genetic variants {{contributing to}} the comorbidity are still largely unknown. The discovery of genetic variants and their interactions contributing to comorbidity will likely shed light on underlying pathophysiological and etiological processes, and promote effective treatments for comorbid conditions. For this reason, studies to discover genetic variants that foster the development of comorbidity represent high-priority research projects, as manifested in the behavioral genetics studies now underway. The yield from these studies can be enhanced by adopting novel statistical approaches, with the capacity of considering multiple genetic variants and possible interactions. For this purpose, we propose a bivariate Mann-Whitney (BMW) approach to unravel genetic variants and interactions contributing to comorbidity, {{as well as those}} unique to each comorbid condition. Through simulations, we found BMW outperformed two commonly adopted approaches in a variety of underlying disease and comorbidity models. We further applied BMW to datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment, investigating the contribution of 184 known nicotine dependence (ND) and alcohol dependence (AD) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the comorbidity of ND and AD.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{suggested}} possible relationships between the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) and alcohol addiction. Previous reports demonstrated severe changes in these neurotrophins in the serum of alcohol dependent patients and during withdrawal. Alcohol <b>dependence</b> <b>syndromes</b> during consumption and/or withdrawal are also characterized by elevated oxidative stress. Polyphenols, including olive polyphenols, are natural compounds known to possess marked antioxidant properties. Thus, this study {{was carried out in}} order to verify the effects of a blend of olive polyphenols supplementation containing mostly hydroxytyrosol (50 mg/day for 15 consecutive days) in alcoholic men during withdrawal on serum BDNF and NGF. As controls a group of alcohol dependent patients received sucrose tablets as placebo. BDNF and NGF were measured by ELISA on day 1, 3, 7 and 15 of the detoxification period. Some parameters of oxidative stress were analyzed too as free oxygen radicals defense (FORD) and free oxygen radicals test (FORT). No differences in oxidative status due to polyphenols were found. However, withdrawal elicited a mild increase in BDNF over two weeks that was counteracted on day 3 by polyphenols. As for NGF no effects of polyphenols supplementation were discovered to antagonize the expected NGF serum elevation during withdrawal. In conclusion the present data may indicate that monitoring serum BDNF and/or NGF in alcoholics undergoing detoxification could contribute to characterize alcohol dependence profiles to improve recovery processes throughout also antioxidant compounds...|$|R

50|$|Withdrawal is the body's {{reaction}} to abstaining from a substance upon {{which a person}} has developed a <b>dependence</b> <b>syndrome.</b> When dependence has developed, cessation of substance use produces an unpleasant state, which promotes continued drug use through negative reinforcement; i.e., the drug is used to escape or avoid re-entering the associated withdrawal state. The withdrawal state may include physical-somatic symptoms (physical dependence), emotional-motivational symptoms (psychological dependence), or both. Chemical and hormonal imbalances may arise if the substance is not introduced. Psychological stress may also result if the substance is not re-introduced.|$|E

These measures provide insight into what might be termed “psychological” dependence or the drive to continue smoking based on psychological factors.

40|$|Abstract: Baejground: Primary care {{physicians}} prescribe benzodiazepines {{for the treatment}} of anxiety. Although most patients use the benzodiazepines appropriately, some patients experience benzodiazepine abuse, addiction, or physical dependence, each one of which is a distinct <b>syndrome.</b> Benzodiazepine <b>dependence,</b> which relates to the development of tolerance and an abstinence syndrome, can be produced by three disparate benzodiazepine use patterns. These distinct benzodiazepine use patterns can in turn create distinct withdrawal syndromes. High-dose benzodiazepine use between 1 and 6 months can produce an acute sedative-hypnotic withdrawal syndrome. In contrast, low-dose therapeutic range benzodiazepine use longer than 6 months can produce a prolonged, subacute low-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Daily, high-dose benzodiazepine use for more than 6 months can cause a combination of an acute high-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal and a prolonged, subacute low-dose withdrawal syndrome. In addition, patients may experience syndrome reemergence. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the medical subject headings benzodiazepines, substance abuse, substance <b>dependence,</b> substance withdrawal <b>syndrome,</b> and benzodiazepines adverse effects. The years 1970 to the present were reviewed. Results lind Conclusions: Medical management for acute benzodiazepine withdrawal includes the grade...|$|R

The oral iron chelator, deferasirox, has been shown to reduce serum ferritin levels in chelation naïve and pre-treated patients and to reduce labile plasma iron, independently from the efficacy on iron overload. Deferasirox is a potent NF-kB inhibitor, tested in vivo and on acute myeloid leukemia and MDS cell lines, and this effect may explain in part the phenomenon of hematological improvements reported in case reports and in different clinical trials. The drug has an acceptable safety profile, with the most common side effects reported being non-progressive change in serum creatinine level, gastrointestinal disturbances, and skin rash.

We aimed to evaluate levodopa-induced dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum of patients with DDS compared with PD control patients. Methods We used a two-scan positron emission tomography protocol to calculate the percentage change in 11 C-raclopride binding potential from a baseline withdrawal (off drug) state to the binding potential after an oral dose of levodopa. We related the subjective effects of levodopa to the effects on endogenous dopamine release of a pharmacological challenge with levodopa in eight control PD patients and eight patients with DDS. Results PD patients with DDS exhibited enhanced levodopa-induced ventral striatal dopamine release compared with levodopa-treated patients with PD not compulsively taking dopaminergic drugs. The sensitized ventral striatal dopamine neurotransmission produced by levodopa in these individuals correlated with self-reported compulsive drug “wanting” but not “liking” and was related to heightened psychomotor activation (punding).
