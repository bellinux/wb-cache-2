5|$|Muhammad {{instructed}} <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> {{to emigrate}} to Medina, until nearly all <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> left Mecca. Being alarmed at the departure, according to tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate Muhammad. With {{the help of}} Ali, Muhammad fooled the Meccans watching him, and secretly slipped away from the town with Abu Bakr. By 622, Muhammad emigrated to Medina, a large agricultural oasis. Those who migrated from Mecca along with Muhammad became known as muhajirun (emigrants).|$|E

5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he had}} taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of <b>his</b> <b>followers.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took {{a position on the}} lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1671 a malaria {{epidemic}} broke out, leading to additional complications. The epidemic was devastating to numerous hajduk families, the natives being more resistant to malaria; thus, part of the settlers moved to Ližnjan and Premantura, while others left to return to Dalmatia. Pivljanin and Njegošević lived in Premantura. In 1673, Pivljanin and <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> included 34 households, 18 of which lived in towns; 8 in Premantura (Promontore), 8 in Mutvoran (Momorano) and one in Peroj (Peroi); <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> consisted {{of a total of}} 157 individuals, 89 adults and 68 minors, 75 males and 82 females.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E

5|$|With the Bábí {{community}} now irrevocably divided, {{the followers}} of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did bring {{to the attention of}} the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire— Famagusta, Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and <b>his</b> <b>followers,</b> and Acre, in Ottoman Palestine, for Bahá'u'lláh and <b>his</b> <b>followers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling <b>his</b> <b>followers</b> to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E
