5|$|The cold opening {{features}} Michael {{trying to}} get {{various members of the}} office involved in a pyramid scheme, which is a non-sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

5|$|In January, the Taça de Portugal {{started for}} Benfica; they {{entered in the}} fourth round and played with Oliveira do Bairro from the third tier. As Rui Costa {{recovered}} from various injuries, Santos implemented a diamond formation with Costa supporting two strikers. Benfica put five goals past Oliveira do Bairro and advanced to the fifth round. Santos attributed the win to his players' attitude {{in the presence of}} an inferior opponent. Benfica's next match on 15 January was a visit to Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. Ricardo Rocha scored the opening goal for Benfica in the second minute and Léo scored the second in the 89th minute, ending the match 0–0 to Benfica. Santos called the match a great spectacle played at high-speed and where the win could have <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> either side.|$|E

Amy, who had <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{played in}} all five Tests, {{and in the}} First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, he scored his first Test century. He {{compiled}} 101 in 150 minutes, helping Australia {{to a total of}} 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring. Hassett’s men {{went on to win the}} match by an innings. The Second Test was an eight-wicket victory for the Australians, this time dominated by Harvey's 178, with whom Loxton shared a 140-run stand for the fifth wicket, contributing 35 himself. He also took a wicket. The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic; batting first, South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7/23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket. During the first innings, Hassett changed his batting order so that his better batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised. Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9, but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably. Not enforcing the follow-on, the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99, losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs. This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory, highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> only 245. The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey. On Loxton’s first ball, a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge. He survived to lunch after being caught from a no ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive. With an unbeaten 151, Harvey took Australia to an improbable five-wicket victory, supported by his fellow Victorian, who scored 54 in a century partnership.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{surprise}} {{due to the}} early start of the First Phase Campaign greatly disappointed Mao. Nevertheless, Mao still urged Peng to destroy the South Koreans by baiting them with trapped ROK units. At the same time, Major General Yu Jai Hung, commander of the ROK II Corps, sent the ROK 19th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 6th Infantry Division (under Colonel Park Kwang Hyuk) and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 8th Infantry Division (under Colonel Go Geun Hong) to recapture Onjong and to salvage the lost equipment from the battle. The ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, {{under the command of}} Colonel Im Pu Taek, was also ordered to retreat south with the ROK 6th Infantry Division. Hoping to draw the rest of the ROK II Corps into the open, Peng ordered the PVA 118th Division to swing north and to trap the retreating ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, while the PVA 119th and the 120th Division of the 40th Corps would wait to ambush any rescue forces passing through Onjong. On October 27, the PVA 118th Division isolated the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment by cutting the road between Kojang and Onjong, but the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment did not reach the roadblock {{due to the lack of}} fuel. Upon realizing that the ROK II Corps had not <b>fallen</b> <b>for</b> the deception, Peng ordered the 119th and the 120th Divisions to destroy the ROK 10th and 19th Infantry Regiment. On the night of October 28, the ambush by the two Chinese divisions quickly decimated the advancing ROK regiments at the east of Onjong, and the Chinese roadblocks in the rear areas forced the South Korean soldiers to abandon all vehicles and artillery in order to escape.|$|E
