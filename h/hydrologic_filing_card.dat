5000|$|A <b>file</b> <b>card</b> is {{cardboard}} packaging with profile information, {{that accompanies}} most G.I. Joe or Cobra action figures. The {{owner of the}} action figure is encouraged to cut out the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> and save it. Over the years, the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> has evolved, but they generally contain the following information: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{in a major}} {{overhaul}} of the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> format, the paragraphs and the quotes were replaced by a short quote from the character him/herself, followed by a paragraph that hypes up the character's abilities. This would be the general format for all the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> that followed.|$|R
500|$|Hama created most {{characters}} {{in collaboration with}} Hasbro. Hasbro would send him character sketches and brief descriptions of each character's military specialties, and Hama would create detailed dossiers on each characters, giving them distinct personalities and background stories. Hama kept track of each character on <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> and eventually Hasbro decided to reprint shortened versions of these dossiers as <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> on the packaging for the action figures. The <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> themselves became a selling point for the toy line, and appealed to both children and adults. Hama noted that: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Prisoner <b>file</b> <b>card</b> from {{registration}} at Gusen {{concentration camp}} ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>file</b> <b>card</b> {{information}} {{would later be}} reprinted in a G.I. Joe comic book mini-series Order of Battle. The mini-series contained all new art by Herb Trimpe. The first two issues focused on G.I. Joe, the third on Cobra, and the fourth on their vehicles and equipment. The mini-series also corrects some of the grammar and misspellings from the original <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Storm Shadow {{was only}} listed with a rank while {{a member of}} the Joe team. There are four {{instances}} where his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> provides a pay-grade: 1991, 1994, and 1997 releases all have him listed as a Master Sergeant or E-8 (the same rank as Duke), and in 2007, the 25th anniversary release the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> lists him as E-5.|$|R
5000|$|Each figure {{also had}} a <b>file</b> <b>card</b> printed {{on the back of}} the package that {{contained}} a biography of the character. These <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> were written by Larry Hama, who also wrote the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> for Hasbro’s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline. The artwork made for each package is illustrated by Bart Sears, Mark Pennington, and McNabb Studios. Because Hasbro also owned the rights to G.I. Joe and Transformers, some of the character names used in both toylines were also used in C.O.P.S. such as [...] "Roadblock" [...] and [...] "Airwave". The codename [...] "Bullet-Proof" [...] would be reused for an unrelated character in G.I. Joe's Drug Elimination Force sub-line in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2013 social {{pressure}} increased and Zepeda [...] "started a slow process of delivery of information", telling the sites of memory and victims' relatives {{that he was willing}} to release information, but he sent misleading signals about the number of <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> their relevance, about the existence (or not) of the intelligence report on the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> etc. In the investigations which Zepeda leads about Colonia Dignidad [...] "everything is confusing", says Journalist Luis Narváez.|$|R
50|$|When Zartan was {{originally}} {{released in the}} toy line, it stated on his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> that he suffered from Paranoid Schizophrenia and Multiple Personality Disorder. After a complaint from a mental health organization, Hasbro removed this information from the file for later print runs, and was not referenced on <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> for future releases of the character. In early development, he was called Captain Chameleon. He was later named Zartan, an anagram of Tarzan, by writer Larry Hama.|$|R
5000|$|Design {{tools to}} systematize the community’s {{knowledge}} {{to draw from}} this information the topics and contents of the didactic material (<b>filing</b> <b>cards,</b> journals, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|They {{were known}} for giving much needed {{details about the}} characters, such as their specialties, {{education}} and training. So detailed were the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> that they even mention the military schools the G.I. Joe characters attended. The 1982 to 1984 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> contained information on weapons specialties, but this was removed afterwards with due to concerns that children may be being given knowledge on firearms and the feeling that a character would only be limited to what he knows to use.|$|R
50|$|In the UK Action Force comics and toys, Flint's {{real name}} was David R. Faireborn and his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> stated that he hailed from Lincoln, England.|$|R
40|$|It {{seems not}} only possible, but even {{comfortable}} {{to compare the}} following models of artistic creation: Jean-Luc Godard’s Jump cut film cut and editing and John Zorn’s <b>File</b> <b>cards</b> montage of musical blocks. These methods aren’t just similar in execution (differences in media and certain technicalities aside) – {{they come from the}} same ideological place and embody artists’ social subversions and revolts towards the mainstream in arts. This is a study on similarities, analogies and divergences between Godard and Zorn, incused in the Jump cut and <b>File</b> <b>cards</b> methods...|$|R
50|$|The 1987 G.I. Joe toy line saw {{the release}} of Cobra hypnotist Crystal Ball, whose <b>file</b> <b>card</b> was {{supposedly}} written by bestselling horror novelist Stephen King. By 1988, the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> no longer contained details about education, and focused more on the character's upbringing, or {{what he or she}} did prior to joining the G.I. Joe Team. In addition to the regular information, this new design of card also included a listing of which vehicle the character is licensed to operate. This would remain largely unchanged until 1991.|$|R
5000|$|The new figures {{also saw}} a {{significant}} change of the <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b> The names, the security number, and the birthplace information have been removed. The new format consisted of: ...|$|R
5000|$|Stingray - {{a one-man}} submarine, {{similar to those}} used in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. The craft came {{packaged}} with an Aqua Trooper figure whose accompanying <b>file</b> <b>card</b> identified him as Shark.|$|R
2500|$|This {{method of}} {{combining}} composition and improvisation involved [...] Zorn writing descriptions or ideas on file-cards and arranging them {{to form the}} piece. Zorn described the process in 2003: [...] "I write in moments, in disparate sound blocks, so I find it convenient to store these events on <b>filing</b> <b>cards</b> {{so they can be}} sorted and ordered with minimum effort. Pacing is essential. If you move too fast, people tend to stop hearing the individual moments as complete in themselves and more as elements of a sort of cloud effect... I worked 10 to 12 hours a day for a week, just orchestrating these <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b> It was an intense process." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{figure was}} repainted and {{released}} {{as part of}} the Tiger Force line in 1988, packaged with the [...] "Tiger Fly" [...] covert assault helicopter. The <b>file</b> <b>card</b> for this figure reveals Recondo has extensive experience with helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Grögers {{resistance}} group {{broke into}} the building dressed up as policemen. They bemused the guards and blasted the building. Through this act thousands of <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> of Dutch people {{who would have been}} deported to concentration camps were destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Mc tab on a <b>file</b> <b>card</b> divider of British origin. Some {{traditional}} {{filing systems}} treated Mac/Mc names {{as if the}} prefix were a letter such as a putative [...] "Mc" [...] between M and N in the alphabet.|$|R
25|$|One highly {{significant}} application was the Sabre airline reservations system, which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre reservations {{could be placed}} remotely using teleprinters and all functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This eliminated manually handling <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The IIRNS has {{the most}} {{important}} numismatic library in India. Available for use by scholars (the Institute also has guest houses) it includes both Indian and non-Indian numismatic works as well as slides, <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> and other records of numismatic collections.|$|R
5000|$|Besides, {{the judge}} refused to release to the Human Rights National Institute (Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos, or INDH) the {{analysis}} {{report of the}} <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> which he himself had ordered the leadership of Police Intelligence (Jipol) to perform during six months in 2005. Once the police had started to make progress, Zepeda stopped them and ordered absolute secret about it. All parties in the several Colonia Dignidad trials, including their lawyers, were also denied access to it. The INDH appealed to court to reverse Zepeda's decision. Following a public outcry, the press started an investigation about the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> finally finding 45.612 cards and giving them human to rights associations ...|$|R
5000|$|Gnawgahyde {{is later}} listed as [...] "unknown" [...] in the G.I. Joe Threat Index. This is a {{reference}} to the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> of the Dreadnok Crusher, where its states that Gnawgahyde went missing after going on a trip with the new Dreadnok.|$|R
50|$|Axosoft (formerly OnTime) is a {{proprietary}} project management and bug tracking system, available as hosted or on-premises software. Project managers and developers {{are able to}} visually see each task, requirement, defect and incident in the system on individual <b>filing</b> <b>cards</b> through the Scrum planning board.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{two pack}} {{featuring}} a Viper and a Tele-Viper was also released {{as part of}} the Valor Vs. Venom line in Python Patrol uniforms, but the packaging and the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> makes no reference of these figures being in the Python Patrol.|$|R
50|$|Lady Jaye is a {{featured}} {{character in}} the slightly altered 'Action Force' continuity, starting with issue one. This version of Lady Jaye has the same file name, and {{is a native of}} Cork, Ireland, according to the 1987 Action Force <b>file</b> <b>card</b> of Lady Jaye.|$|R
5000|$|His <b>file</b> <b>card</b> {{states that}} he [...] "freaks people out. He's always clumsy, jittery, and {{dropping}} things except when he's working with high explosives. Explosives are {{the only things that}} calm him down". This source of humor is played up in the comics (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Royal Guards - The arthropod-themed foot {{soldiers}} of Cobra-La. According to their <b>file</b> <b>card,</b> the Royal Guards were Cobra-La citizens who had living insect bodyparts permanently bonded onto their bodies because their brains were lobotomized {{in order to}} ensure their complete loyalty to Golobulus.|$|R
5000|$|After the [...] "No more secret files" [...] {{campaign}} {{sustained by}} Londres 38, {{and other human}} rights associations, involving representatives of Chilean Congress, in 2014 Zepeda agreed to release 407 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> to the relatives of executed and disappeared detainees, leaving more than thirty eight thousand other cards under secrecy though. It has been noticed that if the victims of Pinochet's dictatorship amount to around 4.000, {{the rest of the}} almost 40.000 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> might contain information about those who provided support for Colonia Dignidad, from members of parliament, judges, big business, state services, police, armed forces, and many others who did business with them, buying and reselling their products, including arms, ammunition, dangerous chemicals, illegal adoptions, and money laundering.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "A Reading from Homer" by Lawrence Tadema, after 1836. A man who is presumably Homer is shown to the right, seated with a scroll unfurled in his lap. Wearing his laurel crown, he recites {{to the group of}} listeners that lounges before him to the left: a girl holding a tambourine along the curved marble bench, a young man who holds her hand and a lute at his side, another youth dressed in animal furs laying on his stomach, and a fourth youth with bandaged feet lingering in the left background. According to the picture <b>file</b> <b>card,</b> this group is supposed to represent young Phaon and his friends in B. C. 805.; Tadema was born in West Friesland, Holland in 1836 and showed talent for drawing at five years of age. At 16 he began art study at the Royal Academy at Antwerp, Belgium. At 24 he entered the studio of a famous Belgium painter who the picture <b>file</b> <b>card</b> does not name. Later, he won the gold medal in Paris in 1864 and 1867 (assumedly in painting). The picture <b>file</b> <b>card</b> credits him as having found his love of "color, finish and detail" from his "Dutch ancestors and early teachers"...|$|R
50|$|His {{real name}} is Farley S. Seward, and his rank is that of {{corporal}} E-4. Frostbite was born in Galena, Alaska. All <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> as of 2005 list Frostbites rank as Sergeant E-5 except for his Rise of Cobra figure that lists his rank as Classified.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Grenadiers {{are led by}} Destro. Following the storyline in {{the comic}} book series at the time, the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> {{indicate}} that Destro had, at some point, left Cobra and formed his own army. He begins having dreams of world domination, as did Cobra Commander.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the water}} intake {{irrigation}} system at Mission San Fernando, December 1924. Picture <b>file</b> <b>card</b> reads: "About 2 {{miles east of the}} mission. Right-hand side of wall constructed on picture". The intake is square-shaped and shows signs of deterioration. A dilapidated shack is visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years, the toyline mostly held off on {{identifying}} the one character {{that served as}} the team's leader. The first run of the toyline featured Hawk as the highest-ranking team member; however though his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> makes specific mention of his abilities as a leader, it falls short of explicitly naming him as the team’s commander. Duke, who appeared the following year, is not specifically mentioned as either the team's commander or second-in-command, but his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> extols his ability to command by winning respect and mentions his current assignment as acting First Sergeant of the team. Any question of the team's commanding officer ended in 1986 when Hawk's second action figure version was released, and the character was officially billeted as the team's overall leader rather than field commander.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> {{that came}} with the Overkill action figures are to be believed, there are {{actually}} two different characters that owned the name Overkill. Both versions of the character are the leader of the B.A.T.s (short for Battle Android Troopers) that are controlled by the ruthless Cobra Organization.|$|R
