40|$|The current {{experimental}} study (N = 546) compares {{the effect of}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> television news story with a positive and negative tone on anti-immigrant attitudes and carry-over effects to uninvolved immigrant groups. Results reveal that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> “negatively” valenced news story about North African immigrants increased negative attitudes toward that same group. Importantly, however, we find carry-over effects of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> “positively” valenced news story about North African immigrants to attitudes toward uninvolved immigrant groups. Together, these findings show {{that the effect of}} <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> television news tone has more ramifications than previously thought, and that the impact of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> positive or negative news story differs for direct effects vis-à-vis carry-over effects. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>As</b> the {{tendency}} <b>to</b> compare oneself with {{others may be}} associated with {{the tendency}} to focus on similarities, we hypothesized that individual differences in social comparison orientation (SCO) may moderate the consequences of upward and downward comparisons. In Study 1, high comparers were found to focus more on similarities than low comparers, suggesting that high comparers are more likely to assimilate in general. In Study 2, SCO was found to be positively associated with mood following <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attractive target, and negatively associated with mood following <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> less attractive target. In Studies 2 and 3, SCO was found to be positively associated with self-evaluations of attractiveness following <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attractive target and negatively associated with self-evaluations of attractiveness following <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> less attractive target. These results indicate that research on the consequences of social comparison must attend to individual differences in SCO. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

We have recently shown that this response is attenuated in midpregnancy and abolished at term of pregnancy in rats.

To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of pregnancy on renin, corticosterone, and arginine vasopres-sin (AVP) responses <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> either <b>a</b> simulated open field (30 or 120 min) or to the home cage (30 or 120 min) in rats.

40|$|Interactive TV ads {{providing}} additional clickable content {{beyond the}} traditional 30 -second ad are evolving as a new model for television advertising. This extra length provides space for additional claims and repetition of brand associations, which should increase overall advertising effectiveness. We find that one <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> transformational interactive TV ad {{is more effective than}} one <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 30 -second ad, and just as effective as three exposures in terms of attitude towards the ad, attitude towards the brand, and purchase intention. We also found that the interactive ad generated more cognitive elaboration than either one or three <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 30 -second ad. For day-after recall, the interactive ad was more effective than one <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 30 -second ad. However, in comparison with three exposures, the evidence was not conclusive.

In this study, we identified physiological and psychological benefits of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rural environment using multiparametric methods. Twelve young male adults participated in a 3 -day field experiment (mean ± standard deviation age, 22. 3 ± 1. 3 years). Sleeping environment, diet program, physical activities, and other factors possibly affecting physiological responses were controlled during experiment period. For all participants, salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate variability, and blood pressure were measured at rural and urban field sites. Self-evaluation questionnaires were administered to analyze the psychological states in two different environments. Volatile compounds in the air were also analyzed to investigate air quality. The data were compared between rural and urban environments. The data showed that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rural environment reduced stress hormone secretion and sympathetic nervous activity and increased parasympathetic nervous activity. Short-term <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rural environment also improved mood states.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} there is an {{association}} between fetal and/or placental weight and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ambient levels of air pollution in mice. Design: Chronic experiments on mice that were exposed to polluted vs. clean air. Setting: Environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> atmospheric pollution. Animal(S) : Female Swiss mice (n = 70) were maintained at different stages of gestation in an exposure chamber located at an intersection with heavy traffic in a major city in Brazil. Control mice were maintained in a similar chamber, located adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>exposure</b> chamber but equipped with filters for particles and reactive gases. Intervention(s) : Animals were divided into six groups as follows: no <b>exposure,</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polluted chamber throughout gestation, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polluted chamber during the 1 st week of pregnancy, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polluted chamber during the 2 nd and 3 rd weeks, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polluted chamber during the 1 st and 2 nd week, and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polluted chamber during the 3 rd week. Main Outcome Measure(S) : At the end of the gestational period, the determination of fetal and placental weight was performed after cesarean section. Result(s) : <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> air pollution during the 1 st week of pregnancy promoted a significant reduction in fetal weight. Mice exposed to polluted air, in any phase of gestation, presented with lower placental weight in comparison to mice maintained in clean chambers. Conclusion(s) : <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> ambient levels of traffic pollution at early phases of gestation is a determinant for decreased final fetal weight. Placental weight is reduced with <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> air pollution at any phase of gestation. (Fertil Steril (R) 2008; 90 : 1921 - 4.
