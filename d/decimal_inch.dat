5000|$|In 1992, the American National Standards Institute adopted ANSI/ASME Y14.1 <b>Decimal</b> <b>Inch</b> Drawing Sheet Size and Format which {{defined a}} regular series of paper sizes {{based upon the}} de facto {{standard}} [...] in Ã— 11 in [...] "letter" [...] size which it assigned [...] "ANSI A". This series also includes [...] "ledger"/"tabloid" [...] as [...] "ANSI B". This series is somewhat similar to the ISO 216 standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size. Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary aspect ratio forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. ANSI/ASME Y14.1 has been revised or updated in 1995, 2005 and 2012. It has an accompanying standard ANSI/ASME Y14.1M that defines metric drawing paper sizes based upon ISO 216 and ISO 5457.|$|E

2500|$|BS1363-1 {{specifies}} {{the dimensions}} of plug pins and their disposition with {{respect to each other}} in precise, absolute terms. [...] The [...] and neutral pins have a rectangular cross section 6.4mm by 4.0mm, 17.7mm long and with centres 22.2mm apart. The protective-earth pin is a rectangular cross section 8.0mm by 4.0mm, 22.3mm long and with a centre line 22.2mm from the line/neutral pin centre line. The dimensions were originally specified in <b>decimal</b> <b>inches</b> with asymmetric tolerances and redefined as minimum and maximum metric dimensions in BS1363:1984.|$|R

2500|$|Valve lift can be {{expressed}} as an actual dimension in <b>decimal</b> <b>inches</b> or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift L/D. Most often used is the valve head diameter. Normally engines have an L/D ratio from 0 up {{to a maximum of}} [...]35. For example, a [...] valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at L/D [...]05 [...]1 [...]15 [...]2 [...]25 [...]3 and readings taken successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the valve lift is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.|$|R
60|$|In my {{measurements}} I {{have never}} trusted to the eye; and when speaking {{of a part}} being large or small, I always refer to the wild rock-pigeon (Columba livia) as the standard of comparison. The measurements are given in <b>decimals</b> of an <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the exact amount of expansion in <b>decimals</b> of an <b>inch,</b> the screw S, seen {{in front of the}} dial, is turned until the deflection previously caused by the change of temperature is reproduced. The screw works a second screw, causing the rod to ascend or descend, and the exact distance through which the rod moves is indicated by the needle, N, on the dial.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{particularly}} {{noticed that the}} whole series of variation-diagrams here given (except the three which illustrate the number of varying individuals) in every case represent the actual amount of the variation, not on any reduced or enlarged scale, but as it were life-size. Whatever number of <b>inches</b> or <b>decimals</b> of an <b>inch</b> the species varies in any of its parts is marked on the diagrams, so that {{with the help of}} an ordinary divided rule or a pair of compasses the variation of the different parts can be ascertained and compared just as if the specimens themselves were before the reader, but with much greater ease.|$|R
50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 <b>decimal</b> place). 26 <b>inch</b> mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|R
