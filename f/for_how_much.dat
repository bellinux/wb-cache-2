25|$|Inflation {{during the}} early 1970s {{increased}} the cost estimates for a four-lane bridge to NOK120 million in 1974, and to NOK166 million including auxiliary roads. In 1976, the Public Roads Administration proposed that the bridge be built with two lanes and a pedestrian and bicycle path which later could be converted to a third lane. On 6 June 1977, the toll company sent an application to the county asking <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> county and state grants they could get for the bridge, and {{if it would be}} possible for the county to guarantee for the loan. The company stated that they felt they should receive the same conditions as the by then completed Sotra Bridge, where they state had paid for the auxiliary roads and a third of the bridge. The company offered to advance most of the state's grants, and receive them back in a period of twelve years. The plans at the time involved connecting the bridge to the existing county road at Kjøkkelvik and use it onwards to Loddefjord.|$|E

Delhi failed to gain momentum throughout the match and eventually lost by 33 runs. The following match was against Kings XI Punjab who defeated them again, this time by 7 runs, as they failed to chase 172. Their final game was against Pune Warriors India. Delhi bowled first and the Pune Warriors posted a total of 171. In the second innings, Delhi started well maintaining the required run rate, but began losing quick wickets after the 10th over. They couldn't chase the target and lost by 38 runs finishing last in the league table.

They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own quota. Countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems.|$|E

2500|$|This {{publication}} reflected {{an ongoing}} political debate. Concluding {{about the same}} time, the Carter Administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) had formed {{a task force to}} review DBA and the Services Contract Act. They published new regulations just as they were leaving office. The Reagan Administration froze all pending regulations in order to review them, and then issued its own set of regulations in 1982. These consisted of five changes: (1) setting the threshold <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the workforce must be paid a common wage for that wage to become the [...] "prevailing wage" [...] at 50% (previously 30%); (2) strictly limiting the importation of urban rates for projects in rural areas; (3) limiting the use of wages paid on other DBA-covered federal projects in the determination of prevailing rates to prevent bias in the base rate; (4) expanding the potential use of unskilled “helpers” on federal construction; and (5) eliminating the weekly payroll report requirements of the Copeland [...] "Anti-kickback" [...] Act of 1934, opting instead to require reports only in support of enforcement actions. These rules were challenged in Building and Construction Trades' Department. AFL-CIO v. Donovan, 712 F.2d 611 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Of the five changes, all were eventually upheld except for the change in reporting requirements.|$|E
2500|$|An example {{this method}} is in the {{prediction}} of college grade point average (GPA) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) usually account for {{a large proportion of}} variance in college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated [...]34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated [...]36 with freshman GPA. It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, so we need to test <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% of the variance in freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% of the variance in freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and test scores are already known.|$|E

2500|$|The second measures, which {{originally}} {{came from}} the common law but also went into the Second Company Law Directive, were to regulate what was paid for shares. Initial subscribers to a memorandum for public companies must buy their shares with cash, though afterwards {{it is possible to}} give a company services or assets in return for shares. The problem was whether the services or assets accepted were in fact as valuable to the company as the cash share price otherwise would be. At common law, In re Wragg Ltd said that any exchange that was [...] "honestly and not colourably" [...] agreed to, between the company and the purchaser of shares, would be presumed legitimate. Later on it was also held that if the assets given were probably understood by both parties to have been insufficient, then this would count as a [...] "colourable" [...] taint, and the shares could be treated as being not properly paid for. The shareholder would have to pay again. This laissez faire approach was changed for public companies. Shares cannot be issued in return for services that will only be provided at a later date. Shares can be issued in return for assets, but a public company must pay for an independent valuation. There are also absolute limits to what a share can be bought for in cash, based on a share's [...] "nominal value" [...] or [...] "par value". This refers to a figure chosen by a company when it begins to sell shares, and it can be anything from 1 penny up to the market price. UK law always required that some nominal value be set, because it was thought that a lower limit of some kind should be in place <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> shares could be sold, even though this very figure was chosen by the company itself. Every share, therefore, is still required to have a nominal value and shares cannot be sold at a price lower. In practice this has meant companies always set nominal values so low below the issue price, that the actual market price at which a share ends up being traded is very unlikely to plummet so far. This has led to the criticism for at least 60 years that the rule is useless and best abolished.|$|E
