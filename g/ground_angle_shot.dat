50|$|The Dark Knight (directed by Christopher Nolan): Nolan uses {{extremely}} low <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> {{to give the}} Joker a more powerful image in The Dark Knight, especially during the scene where the truck he was driving is flipped over and he gets out and starts shooting at Batman. In this scene, the angle actually goes from a normal medium close up and slowly moves into a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|R
50|$|In film, {{a medium}} shot, mid shot (MS), or waist shot is a camera <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> from a medium distance.|$|R
50|$|Full Metal Jacket (directed by Stanley Kubrick): {{examples}} of a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> is during the scene where the boot camp Sgt. is yelling at Joker.|$|R
50|$|A reverse <b>angle</b> <b>shot,</b> in cinematography, is a shot {{taken from}} an angle 180˚ (opposite) to the {{previous}} one. It is used {{to show how the}} character reacts {{to the previous}} shot.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the movie}} was filmed by Muir during the trek. The long <b>shots</b> and high <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> were filmed in the {{following}} year. This was not Muir's first attempt; earlier ones were ended by injury or weather.|$|R
5000|$|A Dutch {{angle is}} a camera shot {{in which the}} camera has been rotated {{relative}} to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch <b>angles</b> are static <b>shots,</b> but in a moving Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.|$|R
50|$|For much of {{his career}} Hoepker used Leica cameras. In the 1970s he began to also use Single-lens reflex cameras {{alongside}} his Leica, using Leicas for wide <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> and Nikon or Canon cameras with zoom lenses. In 2002 he began using digital SLRs.|$|R
5000|$|The Iron Horse (1924): West {{may contain}} several subtle {{references}} to this film, including a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> of a shrieking train rushing towards {{the screen in}} the opening scene, and the shot of the train pulling into the Sweetwater station at the end.|$|R
50|$|In extra time, Clarke came to Huddersfield's rescue {{in his own}} penalty area, {{blocking}} Stephen Quinn's {{drive in}} the 98th minute. Town substitute Alan Lee then failed to score with an <b>angled</b> <b>shot,</b> Simonsen saving in the 109th minute to see the tie through to penalties.|$|R
50|$|Angled shotAs {{compared}} to the fast return that uses speed to catch the opponent off-guard, <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> {{are meant to be}} more subtle but are harder to pull off. However, if executed correctly, it is probably the most efficient way of hitting a passing shot. It involves hitting the ball at as acute an angle as possible, usually cross-court such that the ball falls {{right in front of the}} net, but bounces towards the side, making it impossible for the opponent to return the ball. To hit at such an angle, a lot of top-spin on the ball is usually required as well as a soft touch. Thus, players who can execute <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> well are usually players who are familiar with using a lot of top-spin in their play, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who is famous for hitting Half-volley <b>angled</b> passing <b>shots.</b> Chris Evert is usually considered to have had one of the best directed passing shots in the history of the game, hitting her shots with pinpoint precision against serve and volley players.|$|R
50|$|WRC II Extreme {{contains}} 115 stages across 15 {{different countries}} with officially licensed WRC {{cars that are}} available to the player. An action replay mode is made available which includes a wide range of camera <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> All 14 rallies from the official 2002 WRC calendar appear on the game.|$|R
50|$|The {{contrasts}} and {{the movements}} are highlighted by a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{point of view}} of the scene. There is no supernatural aspect and the painting is clearly influenced by realism, as if the scene could happen in real life, except the fact that the characters are only dressed with togas.|$|R
50|$|The 1949 film The Third Man makes {{extensive}} use of Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shots,</b> to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. An anecdote of cinema lore alleges that once filming was completed, the crew presented director Carol Reed with a spirit level, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.|$|R

50|$|For {{medium to}} longer ranges and flight times, besides gravity, air {{resistance}} and wind, several intermediate or meso variables {{described in the}} external factors paragraph {{have to be taken}} into account for small arms. Meso variables can become significant for firearms users that have to deal with <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> scenarios or extended ranges, but are seldom relevant at common hunting and target shooting distances.|$|R
50|$|Fast low <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) is a basic measuring principle for rapid MRI invented in 1985 by Jens Frahm, Axel Haase, W Hänicke, KD Merboldt, and D Matthaei (German Patent Application P 35 04 734.8, February 12, 1985) at the Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie in Göttingen, Germany. The technique is revolutionary in shortening MRI measuring times by up to two orders of magnitude.|$|R
50|$|One of the film’s {{aesthetic}} and storytelling “innovations” {{was to try}} and tell much of the story from the cane toads’ point of view. This was achieved {{by a number of}} extremely low <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Lewis’ goal was to give a voice to the toads who were at the center of so much controversy, and “create some sympathy for this animal that was so widely reviled”.|$|R
50|$|J. Cain (based on Jimmy Connors) - Cain has a {{very weak}} serve (only capable of {{reaching}} just over 100 mph), but his groundshots are powerful and {{he is able to}} easily hit winners. However, the fact {{that they do not have}} much spin means they often go in the net when going for <b>angled</b> <b>shots.</b> His volleys are also among the worst in the game.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of sepia tones and slow wide <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> to build a sense of {{impending}} dread. It was released in Italy in October 1980 and in America in early 1981 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists. It {{was one of the}} last combined U.S.-European production made for general release, and featured final screen appearances from Sylvia Koscina and Lino Ventura ...|$|R
50|$|The second leg ended as a 2-1 {{defeat for}} United, {{knocking}} the Reds {{out of the}} League Cup. Frank Lampard gave Chelsea the lead with a powerful <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> before United's Quinton Fortune had a penalty appeal turned down. Ryan Giggs superbly chipped in to give the Red Devils hope, but Damien Duff's 50-yard free-kick, intended as a cross, broke United's hearts and sent Chelsea through to the final.|$|R
25|$|The {{cinematic}} {{effects of}} anime differentiates {{itself from the}} stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> to more complex dynamic shots that {{would be difficult to}} produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.|$|R

50|$|Two {{weeks into}} the 2013-14 season, Doughty joined League One side Stevenage on loan until January 2014. He made his debut a day after signing, on 17 August, playing the whole game in a 1-0 home defeat to Leyton Orient. On 26 October 2013, Doughty scored a 90th-minute goal, his first goal in {{professional}} football, a left footed <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> from the left flank into the far corner, during Stevenage's home match against Crawley Town.|$|R
40|$|An {{embedded}} {{measurement system}} for foot orthosis during gait is proposed. Strain gauge sensors were {{mounted on a}} foot orthosis to give information about strain in the sagittal plane. The ankle angle of the orthosis was fixed and strain characteristics were therefore changed when walking on slopes. With a Fourier series representation of the strain during a gait cycle, <b>ground</b> <b>angle</b> at different walking speeds and inclinations could be estimated with similar accuracy as previous studies using kinematically based estimators. Furthermore, if {{the angle of the}} mechanical foot ankle was changed, the sensing technique still could estimate <b>ground</b> <b>angle</b> without need for recalibration as opposed to kinematical sensors. This indicates that embedded strain sensors can be used for online control of future orthoses with inclination adaptation. Also, there would be no need to recalibrate the sensing system when changing shoes with different heel heights...|$|R
50|$|The film Black Hawk Down was {{partially}} filmed in Salé, {{in particular the}} wide <b>angle</b> aerial <b>shots</b> with helicopters flying down the coastline.|$|R
50|$|The {{action was}} {{broadcast}} via fifty-two cameras, including cameras situated inside fences, although {{the use of}} jockey cams, cameras placed inside riders helmets was not used this year. The famous head-on elevated shot of Becher's Brook, which became synonymous with the fence for almost 50 years was replaced with a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b> This was the 49th annual broadcast of the race live by the BBC but was the first not to be broadcast {{as part of a}} Grandstand special.|$|R
50|$|Matthaei {{worked at}} the Georg-August-University of Göttingen and at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance in biological systems. He {{was looking for a}} scientific development of NMR techniques based on magnetic resonance imagery. With Axel Haase and Jens Frahm he succeeded in 1985 with the invention of rapid image proceedings FLASH MRI (fast low <b>angle</b> <b>shot)</b> a revolutionary breakthrough that allows the use of MRI imaging for clinical diagnosis. It enabled the first real coherent representation of body functions.|$|R
50|$|This film is {{interesting}} because it contains the first example, of several, now common, cinematic techniques: camera <b>angle,</b> long <b>shot,</b> medium shot, close-up, and forced perspective.|$|R
50|$|After a 1-1 draw against Fulham, next {{up against}} United were Crystal Palace, who {{travelled}} to Old Trafford to face United on 18 December 2004. Wayne Rooney missed a penalty for United but Paul Scholes fired in an <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> {{to put them}} ahead. Danny Granville poked {{in an effort to}} equalise before United's Alan Smith and rival Joonas Kolkka traded headers to leave the match poised at 2-2. But Emmerson Boyce's own goal, a skilful Scholes strike and John O'Shea's shot rounded off the win.|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} shooting, {{competitors are}} required to take shots from all different positions, locations and <b>angles.</b> <b>Shots</b> often come on the move or at moving targets. Because all shooters are highly skilled, any edge one of the top competitors can get through physical training is very important. In addition to several practice sessions, Eric also spends several hours reloading each day. Grauffel says reloading his own ammo is much more cost-efficient and many competitors do this because it allows them to personally control everything about their ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The stage itself, {{conceived}} by Paula Farrell under chief production designer Michael Grogan, {{was also the}} largest and most elaborate ever constructed for the Eurovision Song Contest. To compensate {{for the fact that the}} vast stage took up most of the room in what is really an average size exhibition hall, the director deliberately darkened the hall where the audience was located and refused to use wide <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> of the audience, in order to create the illusion of the venue being bigger than it actually was.|$|R
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|R
