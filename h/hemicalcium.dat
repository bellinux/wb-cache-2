5000|$|Cryptococcus antarcticus is {{a species}} of Cryptococcus that has been {{isolated}} from soil in Antarctica, as the name suggests. This species grows best between 4 C and 20 C, and some strains of C. antarcticus have been observed to grow upwards of 25 C. This temperature range {{is one of the}} only things that can distinguish it from C. albidus var. albidus on the DNA level, however, it can be phenotypically differentiated through its ability to utilize different minerals and its overall appearance. When plated the colonies have a slightly mucosoid appearance, with a white to cream coloration. C. antarcticus is able to assimilate nitrogen and glucoronate, and some strains can turn a dirty yellow when assimilating the previously mentioned compounds. When being cultured in liquid media, constant agitation is required. On a microscopic level this yeast is ovoid in shape. C. antarcticus has not been seen to sexually reproduce, but when they do reproduce asexually they do so through budding. Mature cells that have not recently budded typically are 4.0 μm by 7.5 μm, and they do not appear to produce pseudomycelium. C. antarcticus is not able to ferment, but all of its strains use cellobiose, 2-ketogluconate in <b>hemicalcium</b> salt, gluconate at pH 5.8, glucuronate at pH 5.5, maltose, mannitol, melezitose, soluble starch and succinate at pH 5.5 as sole carbon sources. Only certain strains of C. anarcticus can use citrate at pH 6.0, D-glucitol, L-arabinose, raffinose and xylose as sole carbone sources. This species does not require vitamins for optimal growth. Cryptococcus anarcticus is able to produce amylose. This species is also able to assimilate L-lysine, nitrate and cadaverine as nitrogen sources.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} and selectivity of an Au/TiO 2 catalyst in a reaction mixture {{which has had}} its pH adjusted {{by the addition of}} NaOH (aq) is compared to that of the same catalyst in reaction mixtures whose pH was adjusted using suspensions of BaO and CaO. It was found that the suspensions acted as effective bases and reactions in their presence showed similar conversions to those where NaOH(aq) was used. The selectivities of the reactions were different in each case. In all cases dihydroxyacetone, glyceric acid, glycolic acid and formic acid was produced but more glyceric acid was produced when alkaline earth oxide suspensions were used (at the expense of glycolic and formic acid) than when NaOH(aq) was used. Given glycolic and formic acids are produced from oxidation of glyceric acid, it seems that glyceric acid is somewhat stabilized against further oxidation {{in the presence of the}} group II oxides. One explanation for this is the formation of glyceric acid <b>hemicalcium</b> salts (and analogous Ba 2 + species) in solution...|$|E
40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) from Bombyx mori {{has many}} {{established}} excellent properties and has found various {{applications in the}} biomedical field. However, some abilities or capacities of SF still need improving to meet the need for using practically. Indeed, diverse SF-based composite biomaterials have been developed. Here we report the feasibility of fabricating pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5, VB 5) -reinforcing SF nanofibrous matrices for biomedical applications through green electrospinning. Results demonstrated the successful loading of D-pantothenic acid <b>hemicalcium</b> salt (VB 5 -hs) into resulting composite nanofibers. The introduction of VB 5 -hs did not alter the smooth ribbon-like morphology and the silk I structure of SF, but significantly decreased the mean width of SF fibers. SF conformation transformed into β-sheet from random coil when composite nanofibrous matrices were exposed to 75 % (v/v) ethanol vapor. Furthermore, nanofibers still remained good morphology after being soaked in water environment for five days. Interestingly, as-prepared composite nanofibrous matrices supported {{a higher level of}} cell viability, especially in a long culture period and significantly assisted skin cells to survive under oxidative stress compared with pure SF nanofibrous matrices. These findings provide a basis for further extending the application of SF in the biomedical field, especially in the personal skin-care field...|$|E
