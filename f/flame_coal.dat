In term of the coal-forming swamp, Chinese coal geology scholars studied the coal-forming swamps of the Jurassic coal accumulating basins in the north of Xinjiang since 2010. For instance, Nie et al. (2016) pointed out that the coal-forming swamp in Turpan-Hami Basin is mainly comprise of wetland marsh facies and wetland forest swamp facies. Li et al. (2012 a, b) deemed that the coal-forming swamp mainly consists of dry forest swamp facies and wetland forest swamp facies in eastern Junggar coalfield. Alimujiang et al. (2014) considered that the coal-forming swamp is mainly composed of wetland swamp facies and wet forest swamp facies in southern Junggar coalfield. Zhang et al. (2015) studied the Jurassic coal-forming swamp in Santanghu, and believed that the major coal seam in Xishanyao Formation is transited from wide water marsh to wet forest swamp, and through the research of its coal petrography and coal-forming swamp, he found that exinite content is zero. This might be resulted from the small quantity of sample, which fails to accurately reflect the evolutionary characteristics of the coal-forming swamp in this area. For this reason, the major coal seams in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield are selected to study the coal-forming swamp characteristics and evolution rules. Moreover, this paper makes a comparison with the previously studied on coal-forming swamp of Xishanyao Formation in Xinjiang to study the type and characteristic of coal-forming swamp and its evolution characteristic in Xishanyao Formation (Teichmüller and Teichmüller 1982).|$|E

40|$|To develop {{accurate}} {{models for}} the numerical simulation of coal combustion field, detailed experimental data using laser techniques, which can figure out the basic phenomena in a <b>coal</b> <b>flame,</b> are necessary. In particular, soot {{is one of the}} important intermediate substances in a <b>coal</b> <b>flame.</b> This paper is the first paper in the world reporting soot particle size distributions in a <b>coal</b> <b>flame.</b> The spatial distribution of the primary soot particle diameter were measured by the combination of the time-resolved laser induced incandescence (TiRe-LII) method and the thermophoretic sampling (TS) method. The primary soot particle diameter distribution was expressed by the log normal function based on the particle diameter measurement using SEM images obtained from the TS samples. The relative function between the signal decay ratio obtained by TiRe-LII and the primary soot particle diameter was defined based on the log normal function. Using the relative function, the spatial distributions of the primary soot particle diameter with the soot volume fraction were obtained. The results show that the small isolated soot regions instantaneously exist in the entire combustion field. This characteristics is different from spray combustion field. From the ensemble-averaged TiRe-LII images, {{it was found that the}} soot volume fraction and the primary soot particle diameter increases with increasing the height above the burner in any radial distance. It was also found that the volumetric ratio of small particles decreases with increasing radial distance at the region close to the burner exit. However, the variation of the soot particle diameter distribution along the radial direction becomes small in the downstream region. This tendency is caused by the turbulent mixing effect. It is expected that the accurate soot formation model will be developed in the near future by using the data reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this work, the {{radiative}} {{heat transfer}} conditions in a 400 kWfuel test furnace were studied. The test furnace is a scaled pilot of a rotary kiln furnace used in iron ore pellet production. In particular, the study focuses on the choice of fuel and the subsequent effect on temperature and radiative conditions in the flame. Several co-firing <b>flames</b> of <b>coal</b> and biomass were investigated and also other fuels such as heavy fuel oil and natural gas. The test furnace {{was used in the}} experiments, and radiative intensity was measured with a narrow angle radiometer. Detailed radiation modelling was performed using spectral models for gas and particle properties. The results show that all co-firing flames give a shorter radiating flame length. Based on the radiation modelling, it was also shown that the particle radiation dominates the heat transfer from the flames. Due to the high pre-heating temperature of the combustion air (1100 °C), the flame temperatures were generally very high. The flame temperature in the natural gas flame was likely around 2000 °C while the <b>coal</b> <b>flame</b> temperatures were estimated to 1500 - 1600 °C. The two coals tested, having almost identical fuel specifications, resulted in a substantial difference in the radiation intensity emitted by the flame. This emphasizes the need of direct radiation measurements to evaluate fuel changes in industrial processes that are highly dependent on the heat transfer conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of fine particulate in pulverized <b>coal</b> <b>flames</b> has several applications of importance. These include {{but are not}} limited to: (1) The detection of fine particulate in the effluent for pollution control; (2) The detection of soot and fuel burnout in real time within a boiler; and (3) The quantification of soot within <b>coal</b> <b>flame</b> for improved understanding of pulverized <b>coal</b> <b>flame</b> heat transfer and soot modeling. A method has been investigated using two-color extinction along a line of sight within the flame which provides a continuous real-time {{measurement of}} the soot concentration. The method uses two inexpensive HeNe lasers and simple light detectors. The results of testing the method on a pilot scale 0. 2 MW pulverized coal reactor demonstrate the method is working well in a qualitative sense and an error analysis performed on the uncertainty of the assumed values demonstrates the method to be accurate to within {+-} 30 %. Additional experiments designed to quantify the measurement more accurately are ongoing. Measurements {{at the end of the}} reactor just prior to the exit showed soot could not be detected until the overall equivalence ratio became greater than 1. 0. The detection limit for the method was estimated to be 1 x 10 {sup - 8 } soot volume fraction. Peak soot concentration was found to approach a level of 0. 88 x 10 {sup - 6 } at the sootiest condition. The method was used to obtain an axial profile of soot concentration aligned with the down-fired pulverized <b>coal</b> <b>flame</b> for three different flame swirls of 0, 0. 5 and 1. 5 and an overall equivalence ratio of 1. 2. The axial measurements showed the soot concentration to increase initially and level off to a constant maximum value. At 0. 5 swirl the soot volume fraction increased more rapidly near the burner and both the 0. 5 and 1. 5 swirl cases showed that soot had reached a maximum by 0. 9 m, but the 0 swirl soot concentration was still increasing. Previous measurements of species and velocity in the reactor suggest that the flame is lifted at zero swirl allowing O{sub 2 } to be entrained and that the flame protrudes further down the reactor explaining the lower soot values measured. An evaluation of the potential for using this measurement technique on full scale boilers suggests that attenuation of the signal across a larger boiler distance is the largest obstacle. The beam would be expected to become completely attenuated under moderate sooting conditions; however, the longer pathlength would improve the ability of the method to measure very small amounts of soot escaping the main combustion zone...|$|R
