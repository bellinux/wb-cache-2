6000|$|It {{is to be}} {{regretted that}} the system of {{continental}} blockade has closed the few channels through which the Greeks received their publications, particularly Venice and Trieste. Even the common grammars for children are become too dear for the lower orders. Amongst their original works the Geography of Meletius, Archbishop of Athens, and a multitude of theological quartos and poetical pamphlets, are to be met with; their grammars and lexicons of two, three, and four languages are numerous and excellent. Their poetry <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>rhyme.</b> The most singular piece I have lately seen is a satire in dialogue between a Russian, English, and French traveller, and the Waywode of Wallachia (or Blackbey, as they term him), an archbishop, a merchant,[255] and Cogia Bachi (or primate), in succession; to all of whom under the Turks the writer attributes their present degeneracy. Their songs are sometimes pretty and pathetic, but their tunes generally unpleasing to the ear of a Frank; the best is the famous [...] "Δεύτε, παῖδες τῶν Ἑλλήνων [Deu/te, pai~des tô~n E(llê/nôn]," [...] by the unfortunate Riga.[256] But from a catalogue of more than sixty authors, now before me, only fifteen can be found who have touched on any theme except theology.|$|E
6000|$|The first poem {{by which}} Dryden won a general {{acknowledgment}} {{of his power}} was the [...] "Annus Mirabilis," [...] written in his thirty-seventh year. Pepys, himself not altogether a bad judge, doubtless expresses the common opinion when he says: [...] "I am very well pleased this night with reading a poem I brought home with me last night from Westminster Hall, of Dryden's, upon the present war; a very good poem."[31] And a very good poem, in some sort, it continues to be, {{in spite of its}} amazing blemishes. We must always bear in mind that Dryden lived in an age that supplied him with no ready-made inspiration, and that big phrases and images are apt to be pressed into the service when great ones do not volunteer. With this poem begins the long series of Dryden's prefaces, of which Swift made such excellent, though malicious, fun that I cannot forbear to quote it. [...] "I do utterly disapprove and declare against that pernicious custom of making the preface a bill of fare to the book. For I have always looked upon it as a high point of indiscretion in monster-mongers and other retailers of strange sights to hang out a fair picture over the door, drawn after the life, with a most eloquent description underneath; this has saved me many a threepence.... Such is exactly the fate at this time of prefaces.... This expedient was admirable at first; our great Dryden has long carried it as far as it would go, and with incredible success. He has often said to me in confidence, 'that the world would never have suspected him to be so great a poet, if he had not assured them so frequently, in his prefaces, that it was impossible they could either doubt or forget it.' Perhaps it may be so; however, I much fear his instructions have edified out of their place, and taught men to grow wiser in certain points where he never intended they should."[32] The monster-mongers is a terrible thrust, when we remember some of the comedies and heroic plays which Dryden ushered in this fashion. In the dedication of the [...] "Annus" [...] to the city of London is one of those pithy sentences of which Dryden is ever afterwards so full, and which he lets fall with a carelessness that seems always to deepen the meaning: [...] "I have heard, indeed, of some virtuous persons who have ended unfortunately, but never of any virtuous nation; Providence is engaged too deeply when the cause becomes so general." [...] In his [...] "account" [...] of the poem in a letter to Sir Robert Howard he says: [...] "I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme, because I have ever judged them more noble and of greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other verse in use amongst us.... The learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme.... But in this necessity of our rhymes, I have always found the couplet verse most easy, though not so proper for this occasion; for there the work is sooner at an end, every two lines concluding the labor of the poet." [...] A little further on: [...] "They [the French] write in alexandrines, or verses of six feet, such as amongst us is the old translation of Homer by Chapman: all which, by lengthening their chain,[33] makes the sphere of their activity the greater." [...] I have quoted these passages because, in a small compass, they include several things characteristic of Dryden. [...] "I have ever judged," [...] and [...] "I have always found," [...] are particularly so. If he took up an opinion in the morning, he would have found so many arguments for it before night that it would seem already old and familiar. So with his reproach of rhyme; a year or two before he was eagerly defending it;[34] again a few years, and he will utterly condemn and drop it in his plays, while retaining it in his translations; afterwards his study of Milton leads him to think that blank verse would suit the epic style better, and he proposes to try it with Homer, but at last translates one book as a specimen, and behold, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>rhyme!</b> But the charm of this great advocate is, that, whatever side he was on, he could always find excellent reasons for it, and state them with great force, and abundance of happy illustration. He is an exception to the proverb, and is none the worse pleader than he is always pleading his own cause. The blunder about Chapman is of a kind into which his hasty temperament often betrayed him. He remembered that Chapman's [...] "Iliad" [...] was in a long measure, concluded without looking that it was alexandrine, and then attributes it generally to his [...] "Homer." [...] Chapman's [...] "Iliad" [...] is done in fourteen-syllable verse, and his [...] "Odyssee" [...] in the very metre that Dryden himself used in his own version,[35] I remark also what he says of the couplet, that it was easy because the second verse concludes the labor of the poet. And yet it was Dryden who found it hard for that very reason. His vehement abundance refused those narrow banks, first running over into a triplet, and, even then uncontainable, rising to an alexandrine in the concluding verse. And I have little doubt that it was the roominess, rather than the dignity, of the quatrain which led him to choose it. As apposite to this, I may quote what he elsewhere says of octosyllabic verse: [...] "The thought can turn itself with greater ease in a larger compass. When the rhyme comes too thick upon us, it straightens the expression: we are thinking of the close, when we should be employed in adorning the thought. It makes a poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for his imagination."[36] ...|$|E

50|$|In his {{earliest}} published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds {{up his own}} literary universe. The Dialog om det 21. århundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer, (1971), is a philosophical dialogue modelled on the classical style of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The plot {{is set in a}} not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new humanistic view on mankind and its new ideology (or anti-ideology), called Wulffianism. Wulffianism is anarchic in the word's real sense, entailing an accept of violence as a mean and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy. Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned dialogues. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>rhyme,</b> metrical with a touch of subtle pastiche.|$|E

40|$|My Exam work {{is about}} how to {{communicate}} with children. Reading for children is important and meaningful. They get connection with adults and inspiration to read and tell stories by there own. Therefore I created the draft to a children book. I made it up on my own. The text <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>rhyme.</b> I chose rhyme for many reasons. First of all, it is fun to write and read. Second, it is a help for children to remember a story. They also get a larger vocabulary. The story is about dreams. I made up small figures that come every night and tell our dreams. Abstract things as dreams {{can be difficult to}} explain for children. My story can be a help for parents to talk about good, or bad dreams. My position is, never lie to children. The story is just an explanation for fun, so children can think about something else, when they had a bad dream for example. My question for this work was; How do you communicate with children in a good way? For me, one good way is reading, and of course, what kind of book. My hope is that my book will be a good communicator for children. In the future I will hand in the draft in to get it in print, and with a hard cover...|$|E
