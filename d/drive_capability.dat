2500|$|Wildland {{firefighting}} requires {{vehicles that}} can easily negotiate difficult terrain and high-gradient roads, be self-reliant, and have high clearances for wheels and suspension. These wildland fire engines are traditionally smaller than standard fire apparatus and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They may also respond to emergencies in rough terrain where other vehicles cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>capability</b> to improve hill climbing and rough terrain capability. Some wildland apparatus can pump water while driving (compared to some traditional engines which must be stationary to pump water), allowing [...] "running attacks" [...] on vegetation fires to minimize the rate of spread.|$|E

It {{is powered by a}} Steyr M16S CI Turbo charged intercooled engine (6-cylinder, 200kW), with 5-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>capability.</b> It has a maximum speed in excess of , and can negotiate up to 60% gradients and 30% side-slopes. The RG Outrider also has a payload capability of [...] Its load bay allows the addition of mission specific equipment, thus allowing the vehicle to be adapted to different conditions. Commercial off-the-shelf parts have been used extensively in the vehicle, with the view that this will reduce the need for crew training and logistics problems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{motorized}} vehicle driven in modern ranch {{work is the}} pickup truck. Sturdy and roomy, with a high ground clearance, and often four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>capability,</b> it has an open box, called a [...] "bed," [...] and can haul supplies from town or over rough trails on the ranch. It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. However, in spite of modern mechanization, there remain jobs, particularly those involving working cattle in rough terrain or in close quarters that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.|$|E

MegaTech {{magazine}} {{said it was}} [...] "a failure on two counts: it neither shows off any of the Mega <b>Drive's</b> <b>capabilities,</b> nor is an enjoyable game in its own right". Mega placed the game at #2 in their list of the 10 Worst Mega Drive Games of All Time.|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} weight {{required a}} suspension redesign {{and the addition}} of power steering. A five speed transmission with a hydraulic clutch was used. Also, {{for the first time the}} four wheel <b>drive</b> <b>capabilities</b> could be turned off, allowing the vehicle to become only rear-wheel drive when desired. The body panels were all very straight and flat to facilitate the addition of armor plating, and the entire roof and doors could be removed.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the initial quantitative reliability bounds for nuclear electric propulsion systems in a manned Mars mission required to ensure crew safety and mission success. Finding the reliability bounds involves balancing top-down (mission driven) requirements and bottom-up (technology <b>driven)</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In seeking this balance we hope to accomplish the following: (1) provide design insights into the achievability of the baseline design in terms of reliability requirements, given the existing technology base; (2) suggest alternative design approaches which might enhance reliability and crew safety; and (3) indicate what technology areas require significant research and development to achieve the reliability objectives...|$|R

50|$|An {{additional}} new feature, FPD-Link III stops using LVDS {{technology and}} uses only CML for the serialized high-speed signals. This enables it to easily work at data rates greater than 3 Gbit/s on cables greater than 10m long. An additional benefit for using CML is the coax-cable <b>drive</b> <b>capability.</b> The CML technology works well when driving the single conductor in coax cables. Since coax cables {{are very good}} at controlling impedance and noise, they reduce the need for differential signaling, which better tolerates impedance discontinuities and noise interference.|$|E
50|$|The BiCMOS logic family {{employed}} the npn devices in the pull-up {{path of the}} BiCMOS gate, to form a low power CMOS logic family with high capacitive <b>drive</b> <b>capability.</b> Intel's BiCMOS technology was enabled by an innovative triple diffused npn transistor. This led to a highly manufacturable low cost process due to minimum number of additional process steps. In contrast, other companies employed BiCMOS to implement Emitter-coupled logic for microprocessors, which consumed much more power. The BiCMOS circuits were developed for the Pentium processor family and its follow-on generations Pentium Pro, Pentium II processor family.|$|E

25|$|BBS {{systems on}} other systems {{remained}} popular, especially home computers, largely because they catered {{to the audience}} of users running those machines. The ubiquitous Commodore 64 (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were Blue Board, Ivory BBS, Color64 and CNet 64. In the early 1990s, {{a small number of}} BBSes were also running on the Commodore Amiga. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, Amiexpress, C-Net, StormforceBBS, Infinity and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the Atari 800, then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST.

50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct <b>drive</b> <b>capability.</b> In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|E

40|$|A {{general-purpose}} {{control algorithm}} is proposed for permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machine drives {{based on the principle}} of direct-flux vector control. The algorithm does not require regulator tuning, and it is tailored to different machines automatically via identification of the stator resistance and flux linkage tables. The model parameters are identified via a preliminary self-commissioning procedure that can be integrated into the standard drive firmware with no need for extra hardware or offline manipulation. The combination of the control and self-commissioning algorithms forms a "plug-in" controller, which pertains to a controller that is capable of exploiting the full <b>drive</b> <b>capabilities</b> with no prior knowledge of the PM machine in use.
