5|$|On 29 November 2011, two workmen {{suffered}} {{minor injuries}} after {{a section of}} <b>gangway,</b> connected to the ship, collapsed during renovation works. The ship was closed to visitors following the accident. An investigation later established that {{the collapse of the}} <b>gangway</b> had been caused by a subcontractor cutting through the gangway's structure during refurbishment work. Belfast re-opened on 18 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} Captain Matthew Moran was fatally injured while {{boarding}} at the Dublin quayside, when the <b>gangway</b> collapsed beneath him. He {{was replaced by}} Captain Eric Jones (see Crew).|$|E
5|$|Pegler then {{persuaded the}} British Railways Board {{to let him}} run enthusiasts' specials; {{it was at the}} time the only steam {{locomotive}} running on the British Railways mainline. It worked a number of rail tours, including a non-stop London to Edinburgh run in 1968, the year steam traction officially ended on BR. In the meantime, watering facilities for steam locomotives were disappearing, so in September 1966, Pegler purchased a second corridor tender which was adapted as an auxiliary water tank; retaining its through <b>gangway,</b> this was coupled behind the normal tender.|$|E

5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the <b>gangway.</b> Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the <b>gangway,</b> {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard <b>gangway</b> as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E
50|$|Besides the {{provision}} of a driver's cab on the CC version of the MP 89, another key difference between the CC and CA stock is the interconnecting <b>gangways</b> between trains. Most of the CC stock are equipped with reinforced <b>gangways,</b> which consists of solid interior panels. This was designed mainly due to fears that the curved platforms on Line 1 (such as Bastille), as well as storage of the trains within the tunnels, could cause significant damage to rubber <b>gangways.</b> However, some trains (#s 02, 08, 09, 13, 18, 51, and 52) have been fitted with rubber <b>gangways</b> since 2000, and six trains (#s 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, and 50) contain prototype <b>gangways</b> that were later implemented in the MF 01 stock (from :fr:MP 89). In 2012, train #12 was retrofitted with the MF 01 type <b>gangways</b> upon transfer of the train to Line 4, and in March, 2014, train #01 was retrofitted.|$|R
50|$|Open {{coaches are}} almost always {{equipped}} with <b>gangways.</b> Originally these were open platforms {{at the ends of}} the coach, but {{from the end of the}} 19th century the <b>gangways</b> have usually been protected with bellows or rubber connectors.|$|R
25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal's two {{extendible}} <b>gangways,</b> {{designed specifically}} for the building are listed as items of state heritage significance in New South Wales, independently of the main terminal structure. These structures are unique and were specifically designed for use at the OPT. In its original state, there were five of these extendible <b>gangways</b> attached to the terminal. During the 1988 refurbishment two of these extendible <b>gangways</b> were removed and relocated to the Wharf 13 at Pyrmont and Wharf 10 at Darling Harbour.|$|R
25|$|To {{the left}} was an inclining funnel and from the upper {{steerage}} deck there was fastened a <b>gangway</b> bridge that was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the towpath are visible at a bridge under the railway {{immediately}} north of Derby railway station. An unused span of the railway bridge over Old Nottingham Road once crossed the canal. Steel girders set into the kerb edge of Old Nottingham Road near its junction with Stores Road are {{the remains of a}} bridge over the Little Eaton line. The Little Eaton line and the <b>gangway</b> have also disappeared, apart from the Wharf Building at Little Eaton, in the present day trading estate, and a couple of bridges. The clock house is a grade II listed structure, built for the canal's agent at the junction between the canal and the Little Eaton <b>gangway.</b> It is an L-shaped building, constructed of red bricks with a tiled roof in about 1795.|$|E
25|$|The 2600 Class were {{effectively}} {{identical to}} the GNR(I) cars in overall configuration, having a full-width driver's cab at one end, a <b>gangway</b> at the other, and underfloor engines. Their bodywork was conventional for CIÉ stock of the time, consisting of steel panels on timber framing. The underframe was of steel channel construction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{class were}} similar in design to the Class 114, but were fitted out as high density sets, built for short distance, high {{capacity}} services, and so were built without <b>gangways</b> or toilets, although <b>gangways</b> were later fitted on some units. They were originally capable of accommodating 262 passengers.|$|R

25|$|Other, less {{numerous}} intermediates, confusingly {{interspersed with}} the other type within the 63xx series, were converted from railcar powered intermediates and, thus, had a <b>gangway</b> at each end and no cab. These vehicles could be marshalled between a driving trailer or connector car and an intermediate of the first type to give a five-car set.|$|E
25|$|These were {{designed}} as commuter units and are fitted with 5 abreast seating and doors fitted at 1 and 2 thirds {{down the length}} of each car, unique amongst the Sprinter family. Early units had no end <b>gangway,</b> therefore in multiple-working with other Sprinter units passengers can not move between units. The 150/2s do feature end gangways, as well as two-by-two airline seating.|$|E
25|$|The naval ratings' strike {{committee}} decided, in a confused manner, that the HMIS Kumaon {{had to leave}} Bombay harbour while HMIS Kathiawar {{was already in the}} Arabian Sea under the control of mutineering ratings. At about 1030 Kumaon suddenly let go the shore ropes, without even removing the ships' <b>gangway</b> while officers were discussing the law and order situation on the outer breakwater jetty.|$|E

25|$|The canal was {{relatively}} successful {{prior to the}} arrival of railways. Traffic figures are scarce, but in 1798, 28,571 tons of coal were recorded, of which 40 per cent came from the Little Eaton <b>gangway.</b> By 1803 this had risen to 50,374 tons, with 55 per cent from the <b>gangway.</b> Rather than it just supplying Derby, the company encouraged through trade on the canal, and this contributed to its profitability. Regular dividends were paid to shareholders from 1811, although some had been paid in previous years. Initially, they were close to the 5 per cent promised by the original Act, but reached 12 per cent in 1839. Although this exceeded the amount specified by the Act, it was justified as covering years where the 5 per cent had not been made. Traffic figures for February and March 1839 indicate that the Little Eaton line carried 13,332 tons, the Sandiacre line carried 15,725 tons, and 9,773 tons were carried on the Swarkestone line. This would suggest that the total for the year was around 200,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|Each saloon had 64 seats, {{arranged}} in eight bays of four around a table, {{either side of}} a central <b>gangway,</b> with two toilets situated in the vestibule at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of SP1900 is yellowish with blue flooring, with fully longitudinal seating {{akin to the}} M-Trains on the urban lines and a wider <b>gangway</b> connection than the refurbished Metro Cammell EMUs. Each car has six 15-inch LCD monitors mounted on stanchions and broadcasting looping daily TV news provided by Cable TV Hong Kong (Newsline Express), advertisements and safety guidelines when announcements are being broadcast. Two small video cameras are mounted in opposite positions on each car for driver to keep the train under surveillance.|$|E

25|$|The {{carriages}} feature fifteen compartments and {{a corridor}} {{on the one}} side. There are regular doors at the {{one end of the}} carriage, where there is a vestibule, while smaller doors on the other end act as emergency exits. To provide comparability with older WLAB and B5 carriages, WLAB2s were initially installed without a closed <b>gangway</b> connection. On the compartment side there is one window for each compartment. On the corridor side there are two rows of windows and fifteen folding seats, each with place for two people.|$|E
25|$|The {{costs of}} the length from Derby to Denby would account for a third of this, and the plan {{included}} an aqueduct across the River Derwent at Derby, costing £8,160. Initially Outram suggested a narrow canal as an alternative. William Jessop was asked to give his opinion and he suggested a tramway from Little Eaton to Denby. This, the Derby Canal Railway, but known locally, as the Little Eaton <b>Gangway,</b> was therefore {{one of the first}} to be publicly subscribed, and would save the construction of six locks.|$|E
25|$|The Duplex {{was built}} to {{increase}} TGV capacity without increasing train length {{or the number of}} trains. Each carriage has two levels, with access doors at the lower level taking advantage of low French platforms. A staircase gives access to the upper level, where the <b>gangway</b> between carriages is located. There are 512 seats per set. On busy routes such as Paris-Marseille they are operated in pairs, providing 1,024 seats in two Duplex sets or 800 in a Duplex set plus a Reseau set. Each set has a wheelchair accessible compartment.|$|E
