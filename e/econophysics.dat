2500|$|Because of his {{access to}} IBM's {{computer}}s, Mandelbrot {{was one of}} the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be [...] "rough", a [...] "mess" [...] or [...] "chaotic", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a [...] "degree of order." [...] His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as statistical physics, meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology, anatomy, taxonomy, neurology, linguistics, information technology, computer graphics, economics, geology, medicine, physical cosmology, engineering, chaos theory, <b>econophysics,</b> metallurgy and the social sciences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stock market}} (or any market for that matter) {{is an example}} of {{emergence}} on a grand scale. [...] As a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world, yet it has no leader; when no central planning is in place, there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market. [...] Agents, or investors, have knowledge of {{only a limited number of}} companies within their portfolio, and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings. [...] Trends and patterns emerge which are studied intensively by technical analysts.. [...] Emergence has been shown to occur in certain <b>econophysics</b> models of economics systems.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside largely lab-based {{approaches}} {{such as the}} Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile, {{many other}} investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display scale-invariant behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including earthquakes, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known {{as a source of}} scale-invariant behavior such as the Gutenberg–Richter law describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the Omori law describing the frequency of aftershocks), solar flares, fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in <b>econophysics),</b> landscape formation, forest fires, landslides, epidemics, and biological evolution (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of [...] "punctuated equilibria" [...] put forward by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of wars. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.|$|E
