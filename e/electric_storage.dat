40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> {{has been recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1970 ’s. When integrated into electrical networks <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> has the potential of numerous technological and financial benefits. The {{importance of}} <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> is growing as more renewable energy sources and higher consumer loads are added to existing networks. However, many of the beneficial effects derived from <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> remain to be examined in detail. Therefore, it is the objective of this thesis to examine several of these benefits, determine the methods by which they can be incorporated into a Medium Voltage network and ascertain their precise effects on this network. In this thesis three <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> benefits are reviewed and examined: peak shaving, frequency control and voltage control. Following this examination the technique of peak shaving has been chosen to be further explored by subjecting it to various scenarios. Peak shaving has been selected as it appears to have the most potential benefits when applied to an electrical network. These benefits are expected to be power supply increase, congestion relief, transmission upgrade deferral, and distribution upgrade deferral. For the analysis process the <b>Electric</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> technology used is a Battery Energy Storage System. The Battery Energy Storage System provides for peak shaving on the Medium Voltage network. In order to test five different scenarios an algorithm is developed using the DigSILENT Programming Language. This algorithm is tested using a simple reference network in order to determine if it functions properly. After this, a test model based on an existing Medium Voltage network is created using PowerFactory on which the five different scenarios are tested. These scenarios are based on future growth of the network and an increase of the use of Photovoltaic and Electric Vehicles. Several simulations are run using these scenarios on different parts of the Medium Voltage network of Goeree- Overflakee to ascertain the effects of peak shaving on the network. In order to test the effects on different network configurations three different actual network feeders are analyzed, two radial configured feeders and one meshed configured feeder. From the results of this examination and research it is concluded {{that it is possible to}} use peak shaving to increase the power supply, reduce congestion, and defer transmission and distribution upgrades on a radial configured network. However, the process for meshed configuration simulation is not as straight forward. While the initial results are positive, additional research into the parameters of the simulation software is required to provide a definite conclusion for meshed configurations. Finally, the addition of Electric Vehicles creates complications in the operation of the Battery Energy Storage System. Several solutions are proposed to alleviate these complications. The addition of Photovoltaics partially removes some of these complications. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceElectrical Sustainable Energ...|$|R

Environmental issues like climate change, global warming and Green House Gases (GHGs) and also social issues like dramatic increase in global population and increasing energy demand are the main causes of global concerns about energy resource management.
