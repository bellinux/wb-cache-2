The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> they were present that far south.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E

50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to find any philosopher of note who asserts a bare, naive, or pure consensus theory of truth, in other words, a treatment of truth that is based on actual consensus in an actual community without further qualification. One obvious critique is that not <b>everyone</b> <b>agrees</b> to consensus theory, implying that it may not be true by its own criteria. Another problem is defining how we know that consensus is achieved without falling prey to an infinite regress. Even if <b>everyone</b> <b>agrees</b> to a particular proposition, we may not know that it is true until <b>everyone</b> <b>agrees</b> that <b>everyone</b> <b>agrees</b> to it. Bare consensus theories are frequent topics of discussion, however, evidently because they serve the function of reference points for the discussion of alternative theories.|$|R

They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, Nick Cotton was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray. When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.|$|E
25|$|<b>Everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> with Su Ze. With {{support from}} Zhang Ji, the Inspector of Yong Province, and Zhang Gong (張恭), the Chief Clerk of Dunhuang, Su Ze started {{launching}} military operations {{to suppress the}} rebellions. He first led his troops to Wuwei Commandery to assist Guanqiu Xing in putting down the unrest caused by the local tribes. After pacifying Wuwei Commandery, he joined forces with Guanqiu Xing to attack Zhang Jin in Zhangye Commandery. When Qu Yan heard about it, he led 3,000 men to meet Su Ze and lied {{that he wanted to}} surrender while secretly plotting to incite a mutiny. Su Ze saw through Qu Yan's lies, lured him into a trap and executed him. The rebels fled when they saw that Qu Yan was dead. Su Ze then gathered his allies, attacked Zhangye Commandery together, and defeated and killed Zhang Jin. The other rebels surrendered. When Huang Hua learnt that Qu Yan and Zhang Jin had been defeated and killed, he became fearful and surrendered to Su Ze. The rebellions thus came to an end. Su Ze returned to Jincheng Commandery in triumph. As a reward for his contributions, Su Ze was elevated from the status of a Secondary Marquis to a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) and given a marquisate of 300 taxable households.|$|E

500|$|Not <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> {{with the}} {{decision}} to use helium. Szilard in particular was an early proponent of using liquid bismuth; but the major opponent was Wigner, who argued forcefully in favor of a water-cooled reactor design. He realized that since water absorbed neutrons, k would be reduced by about 3 percent, but had sufficient confidence in his calculations that the water-cooled reactor would still be able to achieve criticality. From an engineering perspective, a water-cooled design was straightforward to design and build, while helium posed technological problems. Wigner's team produced a preliminary report on water cooling, designated CE-140 in April 1942, followed by a more detailed one, CE-197, titled [...] "On a Plant with Water Cooling", in July 1942.|$|E
500|$|When {{crafting}} Smallvilles {{version of}} Lex Luthor, series developers Al Gough and Miles Millar {{decided that he}} would not be a precursor to the more comedic role performed by Gene Hackman in the Superman film series; the pair wanted him to be likeable and vulnerable. The role was difficult to cast, as no one involved in the casting could agree on who they liked for the role. Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series, on the belief that comedians always want to [...] "please and be loved at the same time." [...] Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice. Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing. His audition went so well that <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
500|$|Howarth's {{departure}} from the series motivated OLTL writers and producers to do what many considered impossible: recast Todd. [...] During Michael Malone's second stint as head writer of OLTL, he had to decide if Todd would remain. [...] Malone {{said that he and}} the other creators could not allow Todd to permanently leave the show's canvas, so they chose to recast the role. They offered the role to Easton, who had portrayed the vampire Caleb Morley on the soap opera Port Charles, but he turned it down because {{he did not want to}} be affiliated with a role played by another established actor. [...] Malone said that St. John's audition was [...] "extraordinary", and that although a committee was involved in the recast, <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> [...] "he was Todd". [...] Malone felt that they made a risky decision, but St. John made it work and that he had made the character his own. [...] Initially, St. John, in his first role in daytime television, was introduced as Walker Laurence, younger brother of Mitch Laurence.|$|E

500|$|Stephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in Alexandretta when {{he learned}} of the {{situation}} in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army {{on his way back to}} France. Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the Franks of northern France, the Provençals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate [...] "nations", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.|$|E
500|$|Columbium (symbol [...] "Cb") was {{the name}} {{originally}} bestowed by Hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in 1801. The name reflected that the type specimen of the ore came from America (Columbia). This name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by American Chemical Society with columbium in its title dates from 1953—while niobium was used in Europe. To end this confusion, the name niobium was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949. A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name columbium. The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry. This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to North American usage; and niobium instead of columbium in deference to European usage. Not <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed,</b> and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations use the official IUPAC name, many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and the United States Geological Survey still use the original American name, [...] "columbium".|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stones {{needed to}} find a new guitarist, and the {{recording}} sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (UK 2; US 1) (1976) in Munich provided an opportunity for some hopefuls to work while trying out for the band. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that they would never have joined. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> that he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll".

500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that <b>everyone</b> <b>agreed</b> he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
