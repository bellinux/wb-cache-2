25|$|All {{of these}} <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals</b> are usually highly {{reactive}} and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore {{considered to be}} a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.|$|E
25|$|Bath sponges are {{currently}} being produced using the sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi with production of about 12,000 sponges, sold locally to residents and tourists in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. These sponges {{are one of the}} only true sustainably farmed sea sponges in the world. The sponges are farmed via the rope method, with low investment costs of a few thousand dollars for farming and maintenance equipment, producing 100% natural sponges with no <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals</b> added during processing.|$|E

25|$|While monitoring, {{regulations}} and action by concerned citizens, {{as well as}} improvements within the industry itself are limiting the worst abuses, papermaking continues to be of concern from an environmental perspective, due to its use of <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals,</b> its need for large amounts of water, and the resulting contamination risks, as well as trees being used as {{the primary source of}} wood pulp. Paper made from other fibers, cotton being the most common, tends to be valued higher than wood-based paper.|$|E
25|$|The yeast S. cerevisiae was {{the model}} {{organism}} {{used during the}} two-hybrid technique's inception. It {{is commonly known as}} the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment. The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known. Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals</b> that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{mutation}} breeding, with the use of gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma radiation breeding. Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten, which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of breads and pastas from a functional point of view. Gluten is appreciated for its unique viscoelastic properties. It gives elasticity to dough and is responsible for doughâ€™s gas-retaining properties.|$|E

25|$|SAMs are an {{inexpensive}} and versatile surface coating for applications including control of wetting and adhesion, chemical resistance, bio compatibility, sensitization, and molecular recognition for sensors and nano fabrication. Areas of application for SAMs include biology, electrochemistry and electronics, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and everyday household goods. SAMs {{can serve as}} models for studying membrane properties of cells and organelles and cell attachment on surfaces. SAMs {{can also be used}} to modify the surface properties of electrodes for electrochemistry, general electronics, and various NEMS and MEMS. For example, the properties of SAMs can be used to control electron transfer in electrochemistry. They can serve to protect metals from <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals</b> and etchants. SAMs can also reduce sticking of NEMS and MEMS components in humid environments. In the same way, SAMs can alter the properties of glass. A common household product, Rain-X, utilizes SAMs to create a hydrophobic monolayer on car windshields to keep them clear of rain. Another application is an anti-adhesion coating on nanoimprint lithography (NIL) tools and stamps. One can also coat injection molding tools for polymer replication with a Perfluordecyltrichlorosilane SAM.|$|E
25|$|When a {{bacterium}} detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may {{start the process}} of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form {{between it and the}} rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex is what makes the endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals</b> that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of these sensors, however, rely on entrapping the protein in hydrogels, as these are more sturdy and [...] protect the protein {{more than a simple}} coating or membrane. A hydrogel is a porous crosslinked polymer matrix filled with water. Several types of hydrogel exist and have been used to entrap small molecules such as dyes, biomolecules, such as enzymes or whole cells. In the case of protein, they can work either by physically entrapping the protein having pores smaller than the proteins or by chemical linkage of the protein to the matrix. In physically entrapping gels, the protein has to be added when the gel is crosslinked, so the conditions used must not damage the protein, excluding the hydrogel, which requires non-aqueous solvents or <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals,</b> an example being TEMED-persulphate-catalysed (peroxide radical initiation) acrylamide or acrylate, which is used for SDS PAGE but for not protein encapsulation.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{of the recent}} work on in vitro enzymatic phosphorylation of silk fibroin and human hair keratin. Opposing to many chemical "conventional" approaches, enzymatic phosphorylation {{is in fact a}} mild reaction and the treatment falls within "green chemistry" approach. Silk and keratin are not phosphorylated in vivo, but in vitro. This enzyme-driven modification is a major technological breakthrough. <b>Harsh</b> <b>chemical</b> chemicals are avoided, and mild conditions make enzymatic phosphorylation a real "green chemistry" approach. The current communication presents a novel approach stating that enzyme phosphorylation may be used as a tool to modify the surface charge of biocompatible materials such as keratin and silk...|$|R

But bleach is a <b>harsh</b> <b>chemical,</b> harmful to human health, causes {{corrosion}} to washing machine and destructive to cotton. It may cause damage to cellulose in severe strength losses (Islam 2010). Recently, the use of hypochlorite in denim washing has been discouraged due to chlorine liberation and it is harmful to environment (Prabaharan et al. 2000).|$|R
2500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the Shroud may have been formed using a bas-relief sculpture. Researcher Jacques di Costanzo, noting that the Shroud image {{seems to have a}} three-dimensional quality, suggested that perhaps the image was formed using a three-dimensional object, such as a sculpture. While wrapping a cloth around a life-sized statue would result in a distorted image, placing a cloth over a bas-relief would result in an image like the one seen on the shroud. To demonstrate the plausibility of his hypothesis, Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over the bas-relief. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of ferric oxide and gelatine. The result was an image {{similar to that of the}} Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of [...] and was undamaged by exposure to a range of <b>harsh</b> <b>chemicals,</b> including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide. Similar results have been obtained by Nickell.|$|E

In fact, what Opportunity has mostly discovered, or found evidence for, was sulphuric acid, a <b>harsh</b> <b>chemical</b> for life. But on May 17, 2013, NASA announced that Opportunity found clay deposits that typically form in wet environments that are near neutral acidity. This find provides additional evidence about a wet ancient environment possibly favorable for life.|$|R

50|$|The {{tremendous}} rotational {{kinetic energy}} of the rotor in an operating ultracentrifuge makes the catastrophic failure of a spinning rotor a serious concern. Rotors conventionally have been made from lightweight metals, aluminum or titanium. The stresses of routine use and <b>harsh</b> <b>chemical</b> solutions eventually cause rotors to deteriorate. Proper use of the instrument and rotors within recommended limits and careful maintenance of rotors to prevent corrosion and to detect deterioration is necessary to mitigate this risk.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge to}} the development of microeukaryotes for genetic manipulation is the presence of a cell wall which inhibits or prevents efficient transformation of many algal strains. Current methods of transformation often require the use of mutant cell wall-less strains of algae or require chemical or enzymatic removal of cell walls. Raphidophytes are naturally wall-less, alleviating the need for development of mutant strains or the use of <b>harsh</b> <b>chemical</b> or physical treatment. For this project, our aim was to compare several approaches for transforming three raphidophyte species...|$|R

30|$|Carbon {{nanostructures}} {{have attracted}} extensive attentions {{due to their}} unique physicochemical properties and promising applications in nanodevices [1, 2]. One of the major challenges for nanodevice fabrication is how to immobilize the functional nanostructures on electrically conducting electrodes. Amma et al.[3] demonstrated that extremely hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be immobilized on a hydrophilic Au surface by means of electrostatic interaction. However, this technique requires <b>harsh</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions (e.g. azo-coupling) to modify the CNT surface with a hydrophilic group (e.g., â€“SO 3 Na). The harsh reaction conditions and the bonded chemical groups may cause some changes of the intrinsic nature of the carbon nanotubes.|$|R
