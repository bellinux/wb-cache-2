Media director Peter Gardiner explained, [...] "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was Polaroid and the corporation released the <b>I-Zone</b> as the tour's official camera. Spears used the <b>I-Zone</b> onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product. The show was divided into segments, separated by interlude, ending with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers. Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs from her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again. The tour received positive critical appreciation. During the tour, Spears was accused of lip synching, although she denied these claims. On April 20, 2000, the concert at Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, Hawaii, was taped. It was slightly altered from its Crazy 2k incarnation and featured different costumes. On June 5, 2000, it was broadcast on Fox. The special was aired several times during the year. On November 21, 2000, JIVE Records released the Live and More! DVD, which included the Fox special.

Kendriya Vidyalaya is situated inside the campus for providing the education from primary to higher secondary students and meant mainly for ward of the employees. A state-funded free primary school named Shishu Bani is also available in the campus to serve the educational need of nearby poor people. The institute also runs a free children computer training center named CSIR Kids' <b>i-zone,</b> which is situated in the colony campus.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF or CAL FIRE) was facing {{increasing}} costs for wildfire suppression {{due to the}} influx of people building homes in what had previously been unpopulated wildlands. This area of mixed homes and wildlands is variously called the Wildland Urban Interface, Urban-Wildland Interface, or the <b>I-Zone</b> (where I=Interface). Now during a wildland fire, more and more CDF firefighting resources had {{to be used to}} defend homes and lives, which meant that it was taking increased time and resources to get fires under control. Also, since over 90% of fires are started by human activity,the number of fires was increasing due to the increased population.|$|E
5000|$|... 600 series cameras {{such as the}} Pronto, Sun 600, and One600 used 600 (or {{the more}} {{difficult}} to find professional 779) film which was four times faster than SX-70 film. Polaroid Spectra cameras used Polaroid Spectra film which went back to a rectangular format. Captiva, Joycam, and Popshots (single use) cameras used a smaller 500 series film in rectangular format. <b>I-zone</b> cameras use a very small film format which was offered in a sticker format. Finally, Mio cameras used Polaroid Mio film which was Fuji Instax mini, branded as Polaroid and which is still available in 2015 as Fuji Instax Mini. This size produces a billfold sized photo. Polaroid still markets a mini format camera built by Fuji branded as Polaroid 300 and the film is available with both the Polaroid name and as Fuji Instax mini which are interchangeable.|$|E

50|$|The Polaroid <b>i-Zone</b> was a type {{of instant}} film camera {{manufactured}} by the Polaroid Corporation starting in 1999. This camera took pictures 1.5"x1", that came on a pull-out strip of paper. The strip was decorated and could later be cut {{to the size of}} the photo when the image was finished developing. Special film that had a sticky back for mounting the prints was also available. The camera was mostly marketed at children with its simple functionality, low-cost, and oblong shape. Unusually, the shutter was not mounted behind the lens, but rather perpendicular to the lens, hovering just above the film. A mirror behind the lens would project the picture through the shutter onto the film below. One major marketing point for the camera was its ease of use: the camera had only three aperture settings, selected by a lever that pointed to a picture representing when each setting would be appropriate, be it indoors, outdoors on a sunny day, or outdoors on a cloudy day. After taking a photo, the lever would automatically revert to the off position to save power. Film for this camera was discontinued in 2006.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>i-Zone</b> {{initiative}} {{proposes a}} new approach to urban mobility management by using the latest mobile ICT technologies. It is about mobile phones that measure and analyse user behaviour in order to influence travel behaviour. By providing feedback to the traveller (self monitoring), by information sharing, or by providing positive incentives to travellers by road authorities and other stakeholders, improved mobility in a city may be achieved. The information is targeted on individual travel behaviour, and thus allows a personalized approach to influence travel behaviour. This enables a shift from a focus on intelligent transport systems, with the emphasis on infrastructure and car-to-car systems, to a more human-centric approach based on ambient intelligence...|$|E
40|$|A fun, yet educational, {{laboratory}} {{activity was}} developed {{for the first week}} of an introductory Materials Engineering laboratory in order to {{set the stage for the}} rest of the quarter. The class is broken up into 8 teams, and each team performs a different experiment during each lab period. The teams then rotate lab experiments each week in a round robin manner, and thus teamwork is an important component of the class. In order to quickly promote team bonding the very first week, each team goes on a materials scavenger hunt together. A variety of materials-related items are to be found around the campus, and various questions must be answered for each item. In addition, each scavenger hunt item is photographed with a Polaroid <b>I-zone</b> camera that produces sticker pictures. While the students work together, they are also being exposed to several materials engineering concepts (many of which will be covered in the lab). The students realize the impact of materials in their daily lives and in the world around them through this activity. The relatively inexpensive lab activity can be easily modified to suit the needs of different instructors. The assignment, procedures, and assessment of the lab activity will be discussed...|$|E
