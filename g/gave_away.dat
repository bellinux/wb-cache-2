5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation.

The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip.

5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} {{all three of the}} group games in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and England topped Group F, Gascoigne {{providing}} the assist for Mark Wright's winner against Egypt.

Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, SpongeBob SquarePants {{signed a}} {{marketing}} deal with Target Corporation and Burger King, expanding its merchandising. The popularity of SpongeBob has translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan, as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Ratings and merchandise sales showed SpongeBob SquarePants has caught on with parents and with college audiences. In a recent promotion, college-oriented website Music.com <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> 80,000 SpongeBob T-shirts, four times more than during a similar promotion for Comedy Central's South Park.|$|E

5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie {{established}} a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world.

5|$|In week two, the Bears donned their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms against rival Minnesota, in {{the second}} home game of the season, marking {{the first time since}} 1999 that the Bears hosted the first two games of the regular season. During the two games played between the rivals last season, the Bears won the first game 28–10, while the Vikings won the second 21–14. Since 2001, the Bears led the series 16–10. ESPN writes that the Bears could capitalize on the Vikings' tendency to turn the ball over, as they <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one. Chicago's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who had been struggling when playing the Bears at Soldier Field. Since 2009, Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game.|$|E

5|$|Kisnorbo {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} {{in the absence}} of suspended captain Jonny Howson on 16 August against Hull City. Kisnorbo scored an own goal against West Ham United on 21 August. Kisnorbo's poor form continued when he was sent off and <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> a penalty for Leeds in the match against Bristol City on 17 September. As a result of the suspension, Kisnorbo missed the League Cup game against fierce rivals Manchester United. After a spell on the bench due to the partnership of Tom Lees and Darren O'Dea, Kisnorbo came on as a substitute replacing O'Dea in Leeds' 1–1 draw against Cardiff City on 30 October. After starting in the 5–0 loss against Blackpool, Kisnorbo put in an impressive performance against his old side Leicester City on 6 November to help earn Leeds a clean sheet in a 1–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{participated in}} campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany, as denoted by his European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver battle star (denoting five campaigns), four bronze battle stars, plus a bronze {{arrowhead}} representing his two amphibious assault landings at Sicily and southern France. On 25 February 1945 and 3 March 1945, he received two Silver Stars for further heroic actions. The French government awarded Murphy its Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and two Croix de guerre medals. He received the Croix de guerre 1940 Palm from Belgium.

5|$|Smith {{signed for}} Stoke City in September 1966 after telling manager Tony Waddington {{that he was}} going to sign a {{contract}} at another club; though Waddington was not keen on Smith's hard-tackling style, he did not want to lose the young player. At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he <b>gave</b> <b>away</b> two penalties in a 3–1 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5–1 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 1968–69 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name, and was occasionally used as an emergency striker.|$|E
