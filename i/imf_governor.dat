40|$|The lecture explores {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of the declining usefulness of the separate currency denominations maintained by that large number of small open economies whose currencies play little or no role in international finance. So far, official multinational entities capable of taking up new threats to international financial stability, like the Group of Seven (G 7), the G 10 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) comprising 24 <b>IMF</b> <b>Governors,</b> and the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), have given little visible attention to these market-driven tendencies toward currency consolidation. As a result, there is scant official guidance {{on what to do}} about these tendencies so as to contribute to greater international financial stability in a multilateral framework. More such attention is overdue because the intermediate stages of currency competition in an emerging-market country in which {{there is more than one}} monetary standard in domestic use carry high risks to the stability of that country and its financial sector.

40|$|The current {{allocation}} {{of decision making}} in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined largely by the distribution of members' quotas, has failed {{to keep up with}} the changing world economy. The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of Fund quotas is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance IMF quota reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new IMF quota formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the <b>IMF</b> <b>governors</b> at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their quota shares to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of quota shares toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the Fund (total quotas) by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of quota and voting shares under the new quota formula. ...|$|R

25|$|The modest credit {{facilities}} of the IMF were clearly insufficient {{to deal with}} Western Europe's huge balance of payments deficits. The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the <b>IMF</b> Board of <b>Governors</b> in the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. Only the United States contribution of $570 million was actually available for IBRD lending. In addition, because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street banking market, the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy, granting loans only when repayment was assured. Given these problems, by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting {{that they could not}} deal with the international monetary system's economic problems.|$|R
2500|$|Quotas are {{normally}} reviewed {{every five years}} and can be increased when deemed necessary by the Board of <b>Governors.</b> <b>IMF</b> voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind. Currently, reforming the representation of developing countries within the IMF has been suggested. These countries' economies represent {{a large portion of}} the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision making process through the nature of the quota system. Joseph Stiglitz argues, [...] "There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created." [...] In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the <b>IMF</b> Board of <b>Governors</b> {{approved}} the Fourteenth General Review of Quotas, which proposes significant redistribution of voting power, displacing {{it from the}} «over-represented» European states towards the «under-represented» emerging market countries. The results, once the changes are applied, will put the four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) among the ten largest contributors to the IMF. Using the analytical framework proposed by Barbé et al. (2014), this article considers the recent changes {{in the light of}} the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the transition to soft loans and the restructuring of sovereign debt. Given that the enormous loans to bailout Greece, Ireland and Portugal recommend continuing to use the IMF to promote the interests of the EU, it is argued that it is too early to speak of European decline at the heart of the Fund...|$|R

40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{international}} organizations using a weighted voting system. The weights of its 188 members are determined by a fixed amount of basic votes plus some extra votes for so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDR). On January 26, 2016, the conditions for the SDRs were increased at the 14 th General Quota Review, which drastically changed the corresponding voting weights. However, since the share of voting weights in general is not equal to the influence, of a committee member on the committees overall decision, so-called power indices were introduced. So far the power distribution of the IMF was only computed by either approximation procedures or smaller games than then entire Board of Governors consisting of 188 members. We improve existing algorithms, based on dynamic programming, for the computation of power indices and provide the exact results for the <b>IMF</b> Board of <b>Governors</b> before and after the increase of voting weights. Tuned low-level details of the algorithms allow the repeated routine with sparse computational resources and can of course be applied to other large voting bodies. It turned out that the Banzhaf power shares are rather sensitive to changes of the quota. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures, 13 table...|$|R
