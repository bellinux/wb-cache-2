Because Ti 3 SiC 2 {{combines}} {{the characters of}} metals and ceramics, such as low density, high Young’s modulus, low hardness, thermal and chemical resistance, high electrical and thermal conductivity, {{it was expected that}} the introduction of Ti 3 SiC 2 to fiber reinforced ceramic matrix can make the composite own some unique properties. In this paper, Ti 3 SiC 2 powders used as <b>inert</b> <b>fillers</b> were fabricated by in-situ reaction between Ti and polycarbosilane mixtures.

50|$|Sherardizing is {{a process}} of {{galvanization}} of ferrous metal surfaces, also called vapour galvanising and dry galvanizing. The process is named after the British metallurgist Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles (son of naval inventor Cowper Phipps Coles) who invented and patented the method ca. 1900. This process involves heating the steel parts up to ca. 500°C in a closed rotating drum that also contains metallic zinc dust and possibly an <b>inert</b> <b>filler,</b> such as sand. At temperatures above 300°C, zinc evaporates and diffuses into the steel substrate forming diffusion bonded Zn-Fe-phases.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between adhesives and sealants is that sealants typically have lower strength and higher elongation than adhesives do. When sealants are used between substrates having different thermal coefficients of expansion or differing elongation under stress, {{they need to}} have adequate flexibility and elongation. Sealants generally contain <b>inert</b> <b>filler</b> material and are usually formulated with an elastomer to give the required flexibility and elongation. They usually have a paste consistency to allow filling of gaps between substrates. Low shrinkage after application is often required. Many adhesive technologies can be formulated into sealants.|$|E
50|$|Ground mica {{is used in}} the well-drilling {{industry}} as an additive to drilling fluids. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobile fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an <b>inert</b> <b>filler</b> and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an antiblocking, antisticking agent. Rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008. As a rubber additive, mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency.|$|E

One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|R

This can be achieved by replacing part of Portland cement with inert additives such as micronized sand and limestone powder. With these materials economic and environmental friendly solutions are conceivable. However, because of its potential negative impact on the mechanical properties of cement paste, the influence of <b>inert</b> <b>filler</b> on the durability of the development of cracks in cement paste should be considered. One of the reasons is that additives reduce the concentration of Portland cement clinker and their strength-providing reaction products.

A combined experimental and numerical investigation was performed in this study. The crack path in the loaded cement pastes was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Fracture processes of cement-based materials were simulated with a numerical model. The simulation results are validated by experiments. The results indicate that the mechanical properties of interface between hydration products and <b>inert</b> <b>filler</b> in cement paste systems have an important influence on the development of fracture in blended cement paste under compressive loading.
