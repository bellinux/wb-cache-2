40|$|Background: Enteral {{nutrition}} (EN) tolerance {{is often}} monitored by aspirating stomach contents by syringe at prescribed intervals. No {{studies have been}} conducted to assess the most appropriate time interval for aspirating gastric tubes. We compared <b>gastric</b> tube <b>aspirations</b> every 4 hours (usual care) with a variable regimen (up to every 8 hours aspirations). Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled patients who stayed {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) for > 48 hours, had a gastric tube, and were likely to receive EN for 3 or more days. Patients were randomized (computer-generated randomization) to either the control (every 4 hours) or intervention group (variable regimen). The primary outcome was number of <b>gastric</b> tube <b>aspirations</b> per day from randomization until EN was ceased or up to 2 weeks postrandomization. Results: Following Institutional Ethics Committee approval, 357 patients were recruited (control group, n = 179; intervention group, n = 178). No differences were found in age, sex, worst APACHE II score, or time to start of EN. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention group had fewer tube aspirations per day (3. 4 versus 5. 4 in the control group, P <. 001). Vomiting/regurgitation was increased in the intervention group (2. 1 % versus 3. 6 %, P =. 02). There were no other differences in complications. Conclusion: This is the first RCT to examine the frequency of <b>gastric</b> tube <b>aspirations.</b> The frequency of <b>gastric</b> tube <b>aspirations</b> was reduced in the variable-regimen group with no increase in risk to the patient. Reducing the frequency of aspirations saves nursing time, decreases risk of contamination of feeding circuit, and minimizes risk of body fluid exposure...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury {{caused by}} <b>gastric</b> <b>aspiration</b> is a {{frequent}} occurrence in unconscious patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome in association with <b>gastric</b> <b>aspiration</b> carries a mortality of up to 30 % and accounts for up to 20 % of deaths associated with anesthesia. Although the clinical condition is well known, knowledge about the exact inflammatory mechanisms is still incomplete. This study was performed to define the role of alveolar macrophages in this inflammatory response. In addition, potentially modifying effects of intratracheally applied nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were investigated. METHODS: Rat alveolar macrophages were depleted by intratracheal administration of clodronate liposomes, and lung injury was evaluated 6 h after instillation of 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid. In {{a second set of}} experiments, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was intratracheally instilled 3 h after hydrochloric acid application, and injury parameters were determined. RESULTS: Depletion of alveolar macrophages resulted in decreased production of inflammatory mediators in acid aspiration (23 - 80 % reduction of messenger RNA or protein of inflammatory mediators; P < 0. 05) and consequently also in diminished neutrophil recruitment (36 % fewer neutrophils; P < 0. 01). Treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was highly effective in decreasing neutrophil recruitment (66 %; P < 0. 01) and vascular permeability (80 %; P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that alveolar macrophages play an essential role in the inflammatory response of acid-induced lung injury.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} {{available}} donor lungs {{is still the}} limiting factor in lung transplantation. We have recently shown that diluted surfactant lavage during ex vivo lung evaluation improved the graft function after <b>gastric</b> acid <b>aspiration.</b> In the present study, we hypothesized that diluted surfactant administration would recondition and improve the graft function after acid aspiration-induced lung injury in a porcine model of pulmonary transplantation. METHODS: Left lung injury was induced by intrabronchial administration of 1 mL/kg betaine HCl and pepsin mixture. The animals were subsequently ventilated for 24 hours. After organ retrieval, the donor lungs were stored at 4 °C for 4 hours. In the control group, left lung transplantation was performed without any surfactant treatment. In the surfactant group, the recipients received intratracheal diluted surfactant lavage just before reperfusion and ventilation. During 7 hours of reperfusion, the hemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded on an hourly basis. RESULTS: Surfactant lavage resulted in lower mean pulmonary artery pressure, higher mixed venous oxygen saturation, and better oxygenation compared with the control group (p = 0. 001).

Aim: We conducted this study {{to determine whether there}} were any pH changes of gastric secretions during laparotomic cholecystectomy operation to confirm our hypothesis of regurgitation of duodenal contents into the stomach. Settings and Designs: Prospective observational controlled study in the Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care in a tertiary care university teaching hospital. Methods: Fifty adult ASA I and II patients scheduled for open cholecystectomy operation under GA were included in the study group and another 50 non-abdominal surgical patients without any gall bladder disease were taken as controls. Three to five milliliters of gastric secretions were aspirated just after intubation and also before reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade for analysis of pH.

We hypothesized that diluted surfactant administration during ex vivo perfusion would recondition the lungs injured by acid aspiration and permit their use as suitable grafts for transplantation. METHODS: Using a pig model, lung injury was induced with 5 -ml/kg administration of a betaine-HCl/pepsin mixture via a flexible bronchoscope. After injury, animals were randomly assigned to three study groups (n = 6 /group) : saline lavage during ex vivo perfusion (control); surfactant lavage ex vivo (SL-Exvivo); and surfactant lavage before harvest (SL-Pre); and a normal group (n = 4), with no lung injury. Cold storage time was 3 hours. A volume of 10 ml/kg (4 mg/ml, 40 mg/kg) surfactant (Curosurf) was used for lavage. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed before and after injury {{and at the end of}} the experiment. Protein and neutrophil percentage in BAL were assessed. Hemodynamic and aerodynamic parameters were measured every 30 minutes during a 2 -hour observation period. RESULTS: An approximately 50 % decrease in Pao(2) was observed in all animals after injury. Ex vivo surfactant lavage resulted in lower pulmonary vascular resistance, lower oxygenation index and higher Pao(2) /Fio(2) ratio compared with the control group (p = 0. 001, p = 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0001, respectively, according to analysis of variance for repeated measures).

40|$|A new {{technique}} of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{was developed for}} the analysis of conjugated bile acids in gastric juice. The assay is rapid, sensitive, and highly specific for bile acid conjugates over the range 30 - 10, 000 mumol/l and is not affected by the presence of food. Ten patients with a variety of common upper gastrointestinal disorders underwent continuous <b>gastric</b> <b>aspiration</b> for 16 hours, including a fasting, post-prandial, and nocturnal period, and aliquots of aspirates were analysed every two hours by the HPLC technique for the six most prevalent bile acid conjugates present in human hepatic bile. Intragastric bile acid concentrations were lowest in the post-prandial period and highest {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Conjugated bile acid proportions, or profiles, varied considerably from patient to patient, but tended to remain uniform over time in individual patients. It is concluded that HPLC is superior to enzymatic techniques {{for the analysis of}} conjugated bile acids in the upper gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|Pediatric TB {{provides}} unique {{opportunities to}} study TB disease epidemiology. Improved diagnostics are of key importance {{in order to}} address many of the challenges posed by TB in children. In the Western Cape Province in South Africa, the TB notification rate was more than 600 out of 100, 000 for children aged 0 - 14 years in 2007; the maternal HIV prevalence was 15 %, with a good vertical preventative program. The HIV transmission rate was 4 - 5 %; 99 % of neonates routinely receive BCG vaccination at birth. Isoniazid prophylaxis, shown to be effective in the prevention of TB in young children, is seldom initiated and many missed opportunities for preventive therapy exist. In children admitted to hospital, mycobacterial culture is routinely done for TB in children less than five years of age through <b>gastric</b> <b>aspiration</b> of stomach contents in this setting; the culture yield is 30 - 40 % in children with clinically suspected TB.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{investigate}} {{evidence in the}} literature on procedures for measuring gastric tube insertion in newborns and verifying its placement, using alternative procedures to radiological examination. Method: an integrative review of the literature carried out in the Cochrane, LILACS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Scopus databases using the descriptors “Intubation, gastrointestinal” and “newborns” in original articles. Results: seventeen publications were included and categorized as “measuring method” or “technique for verifying placement”. Regarding measuring methods, the measurements of two morphological distances and the application of two formulas, one based on weight and another based on height, were found. Regarding the techniques for assessing placement, the following were found: electromagnetic tracing, diaphragm electrical activity, CO 2 detection, indigo carmine solution, epigastrium auscultation, <b>gastric</b> secretion <b>aspiration,</b> color inspection, and evaluation of pH, enzymes and bilirubin. Conclusion: the measuring method using nose to earlobe to a point midway between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus measurement presents the best evidence. Equations based on weight and height need to be experimentally tested. The return of secretion into the tube aspiration, color assessment and secretion pH are reliable indicators to identify gastric tube placement, and are the currently indicated techniques...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the time and development rate of acute lung injury (ALI) in severe brain injury (SBI) complicated by <b>aspiration</b> of <b>gastric</b> contents or blood. Subjects and methods. Twenty-nine patients aged 19 to 70 years, who had isolated SBI, of whom there were 24 males and 5 females), were examined. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those with <b>aspiration</b> of <b>gastric</b> contents (n= 9) or blood (n= 10). A control group included 10 patients with SBI without aspiration. A PiCCO plus device was used {{to determine}} pulmonary extravascular fluid. ALI was diagnosed in accordance with the recommendations of the Research Institute of General Reanimatology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Results. SBI patients with <b>aspiration</b> of <b>gastric</b> contents or blood were found to have significantly increased pulmonary extravascular water (p< 0. 01) and a lower oxygenation index (< 300), which correlated with each other. ALI was recorded in the first hours after injury in about 50 % of cases in both patients with <b>gastric</b> contents <b>aspiration</b> and those with blood aspiration. Conclusion. In patients with SBI complicated by <b>aspiration</b> of <b>gastric</b> contents or blood, pulmonary extravascular fluid accumulation concurrent with other signs of injury may be regarded as a criterion for acute lung injury. Key words: severe brain injury, aspiration, acute lung lesion...|$|R
40|$|Supraglottic airway {{devices are}} {{routinely}} used for airway maintenance in elective surgical procedures where aspiration {{is not a}} significant risk and also as rescue devices in difficult airway management. Some devices now have features mitigating risk of aspiration, such as drain tubes or compartments to manage regurgitated content. Despite this, {{the use of these}} device may be associated with various complications including aspiration. This review highlights the types and incidence of these complications. They include regurgitation and <b>aspiration</b> of <b>gastric</b> contents, compression of vascular structures, trauma, and nerve injury. The incidence of such complications is quite low, but as some carry with them a significant degree of morbidity the need to follow manufacturers’ advice is underlined. The incidence of <b>gastric</b> content <b>aspiration</b> associated with the devices is estimated to be as low as 0. 02 % with perioperative regurgitation being significantly higher but underreported. Other serious, but extremely rare, complications include pharyngeal rupture, pneumomediastinum, mediastinitis, or arytenoid dislocation. Mild short-lasting adverse effects of the devices have significantly higher incidence than serious complications and involve postoperative sore throat, dysphagia, pain on swallowing, or hoarseness. Devices may have deleterious effect on cervical mucosa or vasculature depending on their cuff volume and pressure...|$|R
