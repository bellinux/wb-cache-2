The specific functions of INMARSAT have been established by an <b>Intersessional</b> Working <b>Group</b> (IWG) which met three times between general conference meetings.

The concept was launched when maritime authorities from seven nations requested the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee to add {{the development of an}} e-navigation strategy to the work programs of the IMO's NAV and COMSAR sub-committees. Working groups in three sub-committees (NAV, COMSAR and STW) and an <b>intersessional</b> correspondence <b>group,</b> led by Norway, has subsequently developed a Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP). Member states of IMO and a number of Intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations have contributed to the work, including the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Comité International Radio-Maritime (CIRM),the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ...|$|R

40|$|The fifth {{session of}} the GOOS Steering Committee (GSC) took place on 1 - 3 May 2002 in Paris, France. <b>Intersessional</b> working <b>groups</b> were {{established}} {{to work on a}} communications strategy for GOOS; on the GOOS brochure; and on the status of indicator development. It was agreed that a GOOS biennial review should replace the annual GOOS status report. The Committee approved the final stages of the design plan for the coastal component of GOOS, called upon the Ocean Observations Panel for Climate to increase the effort devoted to considering ice-covered seas, and called upon both the OOPC and the Coastal Ocean Observations Panel (COOP) to ensure that close working relationships develop between COOP and the activities under the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) and the Argo profiling float project. COOP and OOPC were also asked to work closely with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to develop ideas for an Atlantic-wide multi-community approach to GOOS that would build on and complement ongoing developments. The GSC strongly endorsed the development of NASA’a proposed Aquarius Mission that will address long-term GOOS requirements for sea surface salinity. The Committee agreed that it would be premature at this time to start developing a Coastal Theme for the Partners for an Integrated Global Observing Strategy; this development should await publication of the coastal GOOS design plan {{at the end of the}} year. The Committee encouraged Regional GOOS groups to take on board the advice emerging from COOP, OOPC, GODAE and Argo in designing GOOS developments at the regional level.

40|$|The OSPAR Revised Eutrophication Monitoring Programme (ETG 05 / 3 /Info. 1 -E) {{requests}} that nutrient "monitoring {{should include}} sufficient samples {{to confirm that}} the maximum winter nutrient concentration has been determined", while para. 7 of the Terms of Reference for the preparation of guidance on the spatial and temporal resolution of monitoring for nutrients and eutrophication effects (ICG 003) states that "there are at least nine different water types covered by the OSPAR Maritime Area" [...] . "guidance must, therefore, be at least complex enough to cover each type with sufficient clarity to guide contracting parties in their evaluation of the temporal and spatial coverage required to adequately assess the relevant water body". This document summarises the national reports submitted to the OSPAR <b>Intersessional</b> Correspondence <b>Group</b> on Eutrophication Monitoring, and highlights common problems faced in the monitoring of (primarily) inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll. In addition, it presents tests of different approaches to solving the spatial and temporal sampling problems associated with delivering marine eutrophication data. Based on tests of model data, monthly sampling appears adequate to give a good estimate of annual mean concentrations. Buoy data suggests that this would not be sufficient where there is tidal variability. It was not possible to determine maximum concentrations through a practical ship sampling scheme, or by using extreme value statistics. The optimum sampling programme to observe rapid events {{is likely to be a}} combination of ferrybox systems, which appear to be reliable and give both good spatial and temporal coverage, combined with buoy observations. To ensure data of sufficient quality, these must be controlled against conventional research vessel observations. Research vessels still have a role in seasonal mapping, and in providing data of sufficient quality for trend analysis from a large area. This is likely to remain so, at leastuntil technologies such as gliders and optical nutrient sensors become widely available and capable of delivering reliable, high quality data...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results from}} a {{workshop}} of the OSPAR <b>Intersessional</b> Correspondence <b>Group</b> on Eutrophication Modelling (ICG-EMO) held in Lowestoft in 2007 are presented. The aim of the workshop was to compare {{the results of a}} number of North Sea ecosystem models under different reduction scenarios. In order to achieve comparability of model results the participants were requested to use a minimum spin-up time, common boundary conditions which were derived from a wider-domain model, and a set of common forcing data, with special emphasis on a complete coverage of river nutrient loads. Based on the OSPAR requirements river loads were derived, taking into account the reductions already achieved between 1985 and 2002 for each country. First, for the year 2002, for which the Comprehensive Procedure was applied, the different horizontal distributions of net primary production are compared. Furthermore, the differences in the net primary production between the hindcast run and the 50 % nutrient reduction runs are displayed. In order to compare local results, the hindcast and reduction runs are presented for selected target areas and scored against the Comprehensive Procedure assessment levels for the parameters DIN, DIP and chlorophyll. Finally, the temporal development of the assessment parameter bottom oxygen concentration from several models is compared with data from the Dutch monitoring station Terschelling 135. The conclusion from the workshop was that models are useful to support the application of the OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure. The comparative exercise formulated specifically for the workshop required models to be evaluated for pre-defined target areas previously classified as problem areas according to the first application of the Comprehensive Procedure. The responsiveness of the modelled assessment parameters varied between different models but in general the parameter showed a larger response in coastal rather than in offshore waters, which in some cases lead to the goal to achieve a non-problem status. Therefore, the application of the Comprehensive Procedure on model results for parameter assessment opens a new potential in testing eutrophication reduction measures within the North Sea catchment. As a result of the workshop further work was proposed to confirm and bolster confidence in the results. One general field of difficulty appeared to be the model forcing with SPM data in order to achieve realistic levels of light attenuation. Finally, effects of the prescribed spin-up procedure are compared against a long-term run over many years and consequences on the resulting initial nutrient concentrations are highlighted.
