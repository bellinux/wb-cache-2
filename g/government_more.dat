5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly {{dispensed}} {{with the republican}} facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign. by moving the centre of <b>government</b> (<b>more</b> or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was among}} the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese <b>government.</b> <b>More</b> than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E

5|$|The year of Ali's {{ascension}} {{also saw}} {{the signing of the}} Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany. This treaty officially demarcated the spheres of interest in East Africa and ceded Germany's rights in Zanzibar to the United Kingdom. This granted the British <b>government</b> <b>more</b> influence in Zanzibar, which they intended to use to eradicate slavery there, an objective they had held as early as 1804.|$|E
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make <b>government</b> <b>more</b> accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his <b>government</b> <b>more</b> or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E

50|$|Open Government Partnership (OGP) is {{a global}} {{multilateral}} partnership of governments and civil societies to make <b>governments</b> <b>more</b> accountable, participatory, and innovative in serving their citizens. It was established in September 20, 2011 by eight countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States) and several global civil society leaders. Since then, 64 countries have joined the organization and the number keeps expanding. OGP is the first multilateral partnership to find effective solutions in making <b>governments</b> <b>more</b> efficient and responsive, particularly {{with the use of}} technology and the strategic function of co-partnership between governments and civil societies.|$|R
5|$|His {{elevation}} as emperor {{ushered in}} a period of crisis, the most troublesome in Brazil's history. As Pedro II could not exert his constitutional prerogatives as Emperor (Executive and Moderating Power) until he reached majority, a regency was created. The first regency consisted of a triumvirate, and one of its members was the same Brigadier General Francisco de Lima e Silva who had presented the infant Pedro to the <b>Government</b> <b>more</b> than five years previously. Disputes between political factions resulted in an unstable, almost anarchical, regency. The Liberals who had ousted Pedro I soon split into two factions: moderate liberals (constitutional monarchists who would later split into the Liberal Party and Conservative Party) and Republicans (a small minority, but radical and highly rebellious). There were also the Restorationists who had been previously known as Bonifacians.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the <b>government</b> <b>more</b> accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's <b>government,</b> <b>more</b> classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E

5000|$|The size of {{government}} explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism. Introduced by Patrick J. McDonald, {{the idea is that}} smaller <b>governments</b> are <b>more</b> dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller <b>governments</b> <b>more</b> credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus [...] "capitalist" [...] economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.|$|R
