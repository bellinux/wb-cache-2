In robust Bayes analysis a p-box {{is also known as}} a <b>distribution</b> <b>band.</b> [...] A p-box can be constructed as a closed neighborhood of a distribution F ∈ &#x1D53B; under the Kolmogorov, Lévy or Wasserstein metric. A p-box is a crude but computationally convenient kind of credal set. Whereas a credal set is defined solely in terms of the constraint F as a convex set of distributions (which automatically determine , F, m, and v, but are often very difficult to compute with), a p-box usually has a loosely constraining specification of F, or even no constraint so that F = &#x1D53B;. Calculations with p-boxes, unlike credal sets, are often quite efficient, and algorithms for all standard mathematical functions are known.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine a}} group of wave-like cloud {{patterns}} that occurred {{along the coast of}} Texas on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite advanced very high resolution radiometer IR images taken on January 22, 1999. These wave-like cloud patterns were interpreted to be signatures of a coastal lee wave packet on the basis of simultaneous field observations and theories developed by Zheng et al. [1998 a]. The wave packet contains 13 waves with crest lines generally parallel to the coastline. The lengths of leading wave crest lines are longer than 500 km. The average wavelength is 9. 5 km, ranging from 6. 2 to 14. 7 km. The width of the horizontal <b>distribution</b> <b>band</b> of the wave packet is as wide as 113 km.

40|$|The band {{structure}} (BS), electronic charge density distribution and linear optical {{properties of the}} LiKB 4 O 7 (LKB 4) single crystal are calculated using a self-consistent norm-conserving pseudo-potential method {{within the framework of}} the local density approximation theory. Dispersion of the imaginary,part of dielectric susceptibility. as well as of density of states is found. Comparison of the theoretically calculated and the experimentally measured optical and X-ray photoelectron spectra shows a good agreement. The specific of the charge density <b>distribution,</b> <b>band</b> structure dispersion and of the optical spectra originate from two anionic groups, (B 3 O 8) (7 -) and (B 5 O 10) (5 -) groups, forming infinite spiral chains parallel to the [100] crystallographic direction, which are interconnected by sharing oxygen atoms with (B 5 O 10) (5 -) groups. The observed behaviour of {{band structure}} is principally different from the tihium pentaborate (LBBOH) and beta-BaB 2 O 4 (BBO) single crystals. In the LBBOH single crystals, the anisotropy of the optical and the charge density distribution is caused by different projection of the orbitals originating from particular borate clusters on the particular crystallographic axes. In the case of the BBO, the anisotropy is caused prevailingly by a different local site symmetry of oxygen within the borate planes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} is a comprehensive study of transient and steady-state nonlinear optical properties of semiconductor microcrystals embedded in a glass matrix (semiconductor doped glass). Transient thermal effects which give rise to longitudinal excitation discontinuities (i. e., kinks) that arise from partial sample switching in increasing absorption optical bistability are observed in a doped glass. The transient thermal effects occur on time scales {{of a few hundred}} milliseconds. Femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulses are employed to measure time-resolved and steady-state transmission and differential transmission spectra. The measured spectra reveal several beautiful effects which are attributed to the many-particle effects of electron-hole plasma. The spectra reveal: bandgap renormalization, broadening of the tail states and screening of the continuum states, state filling (spectral hole burning), thermalization of nonthermal carrier population <b>distributions,</b> <b>band</b> filling due to carrier relaxation of the thermal and nonthermal distributions, direct electron-hole recombination and long lived (>> 100 ps) tail states which are attributed to electron trapping.
