[...] While no official government estimates {{of the labor force}} have been made, observers believe 20,000–50,000 work as galamseys in Ghana, a figure including many women, who work as porters. [...] Similar problems have been reported amongst the gold miners of Indonesia.|$|E
2500|$|If a batsman has {{a runner}} due to injury/illness there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of being run out due to {{confusion}} {{between the three}} (or four in very rare circumstances) batsmens/runners on the field, all of whom must be safe in their crease when the wicket is broken and also at the correct end of the wicket. [...] For example, a batsman who is batting with a runner should always be behind the crease at the striker's end whilst the ball is live. [...] If he forgets {{that he has a}} runner a quick minded fielder is able to break the stumps at the striker's end to run him out—even if he finds himself safely behind the crease at the bowler's end.|$|E

On 2 April The Guardian relayed information from the Metropolitan Police that [...] "the type of Met Vest she wore over her jacket protected her from knife attacks and bullets, and, for her at least, was optional". Harman compared the decision to wearing a hard hat while touring a building site, which led the BBC's John Humphrys to respond, during an interview for BBC Radio 4, [...] "You wear a hard hat on a building site because... there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> that something might drop on your head.

He also expressed (through his Indian counterpart) sympathy to the Indian people and bereaved families.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 February 2010, the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich {{announced}} plans to republish an annotated version of the text, for educational purposes in schools and universities, in 2015, when the copyright currently held by the Bavarian state government expires (2016). The book had last been published in Germany in 1945. A group of German historians argued that a republication was necessary to get an authoritative annotated edition {{by the time the}} copyright runs out, which might open the way for neo-Nazi groups to publish their own versions. [...] "Once Bavaria's copyright expires, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves," [...] Wolfgang Heubisch said. The Bavarian government opposed the plan, citing respect for victims of the Holocaust. Its Finance Ministry said that permits for reprints would not be issued, at home or abroad. This would also apply to a new annotated edition. The republished book might be banned as Nazi propaganda. Even after expiration of the copyright, the Bavarian government emphasised that [...] "the dissemination of Nazi ideologies will remain prohibited in Germany and is punishable under the penal code".|$|E
