5|$|As a diplodocid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that Dinheirosaurus {{possessed a}} whip-tail. If it did, {{it is likely}} that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with {{supersonic}} speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within a few minutes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> {{that the}} {{sarcophagus}} was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains {{to say a}} daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.|$|E
6000|$|Her host {{dropped his}} eyes as well; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that the {{movement}} had in each case a different spring. [...] "Yes, and what else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gaff {{said that}} he would, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> he should reach home sooner by her than {{if he were to}} {{accompany}} the [...] "Blazer" [...] to London.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, Hélie then {{served in}} the 11e Régiment Parachutiste de Choc. By definition, there was no {{information}} on this passage, however <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that he remained in Indochina.|$|R
5|$|Seated at {{an ornate}} wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's {{original}} tale), the heroine {{of one of}} the novelle. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo.|$|E
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> {{that for}} ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply {{assigned}} a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{they would}} have done, sir. I was very glad when I saw the boat coming, as I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that you <b>were</b> on board her, and we are rather in a difficulty." ...|$|R
60|$|One morning, accordingly, when {{alone with}} the count, he said {{to him that he}} feared he should have to leave for England in a few days, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> he should shortly join his ship.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> Rose <b>was</b> not displeased at this {{allusion to}} herself, for a smile {{struggled}} around her pretty mouth, {{and she did}} not look at all angry. After another short pause, she resumed the discourse.|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> {{that there has been}} a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable,</b> therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that in {{the early}} 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and {{settlements}} in the Caribbean and Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} the boys thought of rolling down the steep slope, and taking their chance, but this they agreed would be a last resource, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that the slope ended in an {{absolute}} precipice.|$|R
60|$|Tressilian paused an instant. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{indifferent}} {{to him by}} what road he left a spot now so odious to his recollections; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that the postern door was locked, and his retreat by that pass rendered impossible.|$|R
60|$|Ronald {{knew enough}} of the natives to feel that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> enough that the fowls were stolen; but his sense of {{morality}} was not sufficiently keen for him to hurt the woman's feelings by rejecting her offerings.|$|R
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> {{that he died}} on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given {{to him in the}} 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct in the wild even earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Theban Hills are {{dominated}} by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or 'The Peak'. It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, {{more than a thousand}} years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Mr. Slope, {{how long}} I have been officiating as a clergyman in this city?" [...] Mr. Slope's wish was now nearly fulfilled. Mr. Harding had become angry, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> {{that he might}} commit himself.|$|R
60|$|Roux de Marsilly came hither {{when your}} Majesty {{had made a}} union with Holland for making the Peace betwixt the two Crownes and when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> the {{opposition}} to the Peace would bee on the side of France.|$|R
60|$|Ibid. Burnet. I preached {{in many of}} {{the churches}} of London; and was so well received, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> I might <b>be</b> {{accepted}} of in any that was to be disposed of by a popular election.--Swift. Much to his honour.|$|R
5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for recreational diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.|$|E
60|$|Learning, from them, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> Lord Cornwallis would advance {{as soon as}} they rejoined him, Dick {{determined}} to go back to Bangalore, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unlikely that, after the severe check they had received, the Mahrattis would resume the offensive for a time.|$|R
60|$|From {{the moment}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> the party would {{be obliged to}} pass the winter at Sealer's Land, therefore, Roswell had kept a {{vigilant}} eye on the wood. Stimson had more than once, spoken {{to him on the}} subject, and with great prudence.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{then told}} the story of the {{intervention}} of the tiger in their behalf, and said that afterward an Indian lady had succored them, hinting {{that at the end of}} the war <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that Ned would present his father with a daughter-in-law.|$|R
5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|According to Pat Southern, principes {{appear to}} have been born from {{remnants}} of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E
60|$|Hakon {{was glad}} to hear this, {{and told her to}} inform Haldor that he would soon be in the fiord with his longship, that he would aid the people of Horlingdal in {{resisting}} Harald, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> Rolf Ganger would also join them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] {{said his}} lordship, {{after looking at}} his daughter, whose colour fled {{at the idea of}} seeing the deer shot, although, had her father {{expressed}} his wish that they should accompany Norman, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> she would not even have hinted her reluctance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take my {{word for}} it, it would. Look all around. There was Adelaide Schropner,--but that was before your time, and you would not remember." [...] Considering that Adelaide Schropner had been for many years a grandmother, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> that Isa would not remember.|$|R
