5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging,</b> {{electron}} microscopy, and nuclear science. In <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging,</b> heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
40|$|Background: Myositis {{ossificans}} is localized inflammatory process affecting skeletal muscles. Very rarely it {{can affect}} {{one of the}} neck muscles and present as a neck tumor, it can be misdiagnosed as the clinical, radiological and histological examinations can mimic a sarcoma. Case Report: We report a 29 year old female patient with neck tumor suspected to be a sarcoma who underwent full <b>diagnostics</b> <b>imaging</b> and open bipsy with histopatological examination, afterwards surgical excision was performed. Conclusions: The {{aim of this study}} was to present the differential diagnosis based on <b>diagnostics</b> <b>imaging</b> between MO and malignant tumors, such as parosteal sarcoma, synovial sarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma...|$|R

5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E

40|$|A 25 -year-old male {{patient with}} a primary retroperitoneal {{teratoma}} is described. The chief complaint was right hypochondralgia during exercise for seven days. Various <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imagings</b> disclosed an expansive, heterogeneous and fat-rich mass associated with multiple cystic lesions in the right suprarenal fossa. Sagittal, transaxial and coronal magnetic resonance imaging scan visualized the extent and character of the tumor very clearly. Histological examination of the tumor removed through a thoracoabdominal approach showed cystic teratoma with out malignant transformations...|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{standards}} expected from <b>diagnostic</b> medical <b>imaging,</b> the analysis of information regarding waiting lists via different information systems is of utmost importance. Such analysis, on the one hand, may improve the diagnostic quality and, on the other hand, {{may lead to the}} reduction of waiting times, with the concomitant increase of the quality of services and the reduction of the inherent financial costs. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to assess the waiting time in the delivery of <b>diagnostic</b> medical <b>imaging</b> services, like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Thereby, this work is focused on the development of a decision support system to assess waiting times in <b>diagnostic</b> medical <b>imaging</b> with recourse to operational data of selected attributes extracted from distinct information systems.

40|$|A six {{year old}} female spayed Pomeranian dog {{presented}} to Cornell with vestibular signs localizable to the cerebellum. MRI identified a well-demarcated, wedge-shaped lesion {{in the distribution}} of the right rostral cerebellar artery which was hyperintense on T 2 and mildly contrast-enhancing, a classic presentation for vascular accident. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. Ancillary testing revealed azotemia, mild nonregenerative anemia, increased urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, increased fibrinogen, increased D-dimers, and decreased antithrombin. Based on the results of these tests, a diagnosis of cerebellar vascular accident secondary to protein losing nephropathy was made.
