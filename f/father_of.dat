40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} behavior demonstrated during videotaped family interaction in an unstructured situation (interpreted as interpersonally stressful). Twenty families contained a disturbed child (aggressive, socially withdrawn, or distractible); 10 were normal control families. Repeated judgments were made on evaluative, directing, and activity dimensions. Analyses of covariance (covariate: amount of talking) showed significant differences between fathers but not mothers or children. <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> "normal " children were evaluatively neutral and nondirecting (suggesting low attempts to control others) and untalkative (suggesting social independence). <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> "disturbed " children showed "controlling " and/or "dependent " behavior: <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> distractible children were evaluatively extreme and talkative; <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> withdrawn children were neutral, nondirecting, and talkative; <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> aggressive children were negatively extreme, directing, and untalkative.

40|$|In this {{quantitative}} study, I {{examined the}} involvement levels <b>of</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children attending public preschool programs using the Family Involvement Questionnaire; I also examined fathers' satisfaction with school contact and involvement experiences using the Parent Satisfaction with Educational Experiences scale. Additionally, I investigated public preschool programs' efforts to involve fathers in school using modified {{versions of the}} family involvement and parent satisfaction measures. The final {{purpose of this study}} was to determine which demographic and child characteristics, if any, influence father involvement levels in school. Fifty-two biological fathers rated their own involvement in activities at their children's schools, and they rated their own satisfaction with school contact and involvement experiences. Two public preschool administrators answered questions about what types of involvement opportunities are offered to fathers. Participating fathers' children were enrolled in one of the three following public preschool programs: Head Start, Prekindergarten (PreK), or Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE). <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities, as well as <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children without disabilities, were included in this study. As predicted, <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children in Head Start volunteered at school more frequently than <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children in PreK or ECSE programs. However, contrary to the original hypothesis, <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities were more involved in school activities compared to <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children without disabilities. <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities were equally satisfied with school contact and involvement compared to <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children without disabilities with the exception of one item on the satisfaction measure; <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities were more satisfied with their contact with other parents outside of school. Examination of the predictive value of fathers' income levels, child's gender, child's disability status, schools' efforts to involve fathers, and satisfaction on fathers' involvement levels resulted in only one significant finding. Lower income predicted higher levels of volunteerism in school. Correlational analyses revealed a number of significant positive relationships between items on the involvement and satisfaction measures. However, more research is necessary to establish causal relationships between satisfaction and involvement. Additionally, researchers, teachers and policy makers need to carefully examine the ways in which fathers are currently involved in public preschool programs and make programmatic changes, as necessary. Finally, low-income <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities face more adversity than either low-income <b>fathers</b> or <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with disabilities; thus, it is very possible that they need to be supported differently. More research is needed to find out what these fathers need to support their children and to remain involved in their children's lives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While {{fathers were}} {{neglected}} {{for a long}} time in research investigating families of pediatric patients, there are now a few studies available on fathers' posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about the course of PTSS and PTSD in <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> pediatric patients. The present study aimed to compare the prevalence and course of PTSS and PTSD in <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with different chronic and acute conditions and to identify factors that contribute to fathers' PTSS. Methods Sixty-nine <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children newly diagnosed with either cancer, type I diabetes mellitus, or epilepsy and 70 <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children suffering from an unintentional injury completed questionnaires at 4 – 6 weeks (Time 1) and six months (Time 2) after diagnosis or injury. Results Noticeable PTSD rates were found in <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with a chronic disease (26 % at Time 1 and 21 % at Time 2, respectively). These rates were significantly higher than rates found in <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with unintentional injuries (12 % at Time 1 and 6 % at Time 2, respectively). Within six months after the child's diagnosis or accident a decrease in severity of PTSS was observed in both groups. Significant predictors of PTSS at Time 2 were the <b>father's</b> initial level <b>of</b> PTSS, the child's medical condition (injuries vs. chronic diseases) and functional status, the <b>father's</b> use <b>of</b> dysfunctional coping strategies, and <b>father's</b> level <b>of</b> neuroticism. Conclusion Our findings suggest that fathers with initially high PTSS levels are at greater risk to experience PTSS at follow-up, particularly <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with a chronic disease. Sensitizing health care professionals to the identification of PTSS symptoms but also to indicators of neuroticism and the use of specific coping strategies early in the treatment course is essential for the planning and implementation of adequate intervention strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the parental and spousal experience <b>of</b> <b>fathers</b> in families <b>of</b> children with chronic illness and to compare this to the experience <b>of</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> healthy children. Four research questions were explored: As parents, what is the experience reported by <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with chronic illness in terms of participation in care, overprotection, discipline, communication, family leisure/recreation? Along the same dimensions, how does this compare to the experience reported by mothers? As husbands, what is the experience reported by <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with chronic illness in terms of caretaking responsibility, marital satisfaction, communication? Along the same dimensions, how does this compare to the experience reported by wives? Subjects were 52 sets of parents of children with diabetes, 52 sets of parents of children with cystic fibrosis, and 52 sets of parents of healthy children. All subjects completed the Feetham Family Functioning Survey and Impact on Family Scale. Six fathers and six sets <b>of</b> <b>fathers</b> and mothers were randomly selected for an interview developed by the investigator. Subsets of combined items from the two instruments were determined by the investigator to provide descriptive children. Correlated t-tests were used to determine information regarding subsystem variables. Analysis of variance was performed to explore differences among <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and healthy differences between <b>fathers</b> and mothers <b>of</b> children with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and healthy children. Interview data were used descriptively. <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with chronic illness reported significantly greater personal strain and total impact than did mothers. Moreover, findings were significant particularly with respect to parental variables 2 ̆ 2 participation in care 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 communication. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Fathers</b> <b>of</b> children with chronic illness felt they should participate significantly more in care than did <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> healthy children. They participated significantly less in care than did mothers. They reported significantly less communication with children than did <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> healthy children and than did mothers. Good communication and marital satisfaction were indicated by husbands and wives. The influences on families of role as well as the nature of chronic illness in children was considered. ...|$|R
