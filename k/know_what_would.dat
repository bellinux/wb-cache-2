25|$|From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a Privatdozent at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was {{finishing}} {{the writing of}} his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence {{much larger than the}} spacing between the resonators in Ewald’s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of x-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.|$|E

[...] Singer stated {{that he would have}} cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with [...] "the jet {{disaster}} sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, I would do an origin.

500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened to me. I don't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E

500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, [...] "Sony went in a new direction." ...|$|E

[...] He also urged the party not to forget about sports when distributing money. [...] "We all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if the young did not practice any sport.

2500|$|However, Sondheim decided [...] "that {{there are}} better places to start a show" [...] and found a new {{collaborator}} in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: [...] "I was discouraged, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre"; Lapine has a taste [...] "for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Compute! {{presented}} opposing {{views of}} the game in May 1988. The magazine included Balance of Power in its list of [...] "Our Favorite Games", calling it [...] "an impressive recreation of the world's geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you'll see the chilling message You have ignited a nuclear war". Orson Scott Card, however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—"the best designer of simulation games I've seen"—was [...] "leaning over your shoulder and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion {{that as long as the}} United States is very nice and doesn't do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don't play that way, why, he'll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war". He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> cause one, and [...] "there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them than when we disarm", but that [...] " [...] is so sure he's right that Balance of Power isn't a game, it's propaganda".|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{a new theory}} of appeasement, {{sometimes}} called [...] "counter-revisionist", emerged as historians argued that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, {{but that it was}} poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. Appeasement was considered a viable policy, considering the strains that the British Empire faced in recuperating from World War I, and Chamberlain was said to have adopted a policy suitable to Britain's cultural and political needs. Frank McDonough is a leading proponent of this view of appeasement and describes his book Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War as a [...] "post revisionist" [...] study. Appeasement was a crisis management strategy seeking a peaceful settlement of Hitler's grievances. [...] "Chamberlain's worst error", says McDonough, [...] "was to believe that he could march Hitler on the yellow brick road to peace when in reality Hitler was marching very firmly on the road to war." [...] He has criticized revisionist historians for concentrating on Chamberlain's motivations rather than how appeasement worked in practice – as a [...] "usable policy" [...] to deal with Hitler. James P. Levy argues against the outright condemnation of appeasement. [...] "Knowing what Hitler did later," [...] he writes, [...] "the critics of Appeasement condemn the men who tried to keep the peace in the 1930s, men who could not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> come later. ... The political leaders responsible for Appeasement made many errors. They were not blameless. But what they attempted was logical, rational, and humane." ...|$|E
