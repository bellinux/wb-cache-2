5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|The {{patchwork}} construction {{does not}} use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract {{point of view is}} called the intrinsic view. It can make it harder to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a normal bundle, but instead there is an intrinsic stable normal bundle.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{the last}} book in which Vicky appears, readers are left to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> happens to Vicky when she grows up. It is likely she becomes a writer. Whether she and Adam end up together, or if she finds love elsewhere, is unknown. From the last {{statements}} of the books, it is at least certain that Vicky and Adam remain close friends.|$|E
25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the rooms}} {{on the first floor}} and many {{of the rooms}} {{on the second floor of}} Boldt Castle are {{furnished}} , but mostly with modern pieces. The basement is mostly unfinished, with a pool, bowling lanes, many compartments, and a long passage to the Power House. Most of the rooms from the second floor to the top floor have been left unfurnished, but there are exhibits in some of these rooms and hallways showing pictures and artifacts of the Thousand Islands region during the era in which the Boldts lived. These rooms are also left unfurnished to give the visitor an opportunity to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> the castle looked like before modern improvement. At the edge of the island, a monument stone triumphal arch, originally intended by George Boldt to be the entrance way for boats, has been fully restored. The bridge connecting the two sides would have been raised and lowered as required.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it is like to see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of {{what it is like to}} see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "While this isn’t saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12’s better shows. Both plots work well, though I prefer the childproofing side of things; it peters {{out at the}} end, but it has some good bits. The episode keeps us interested and entertained." [...] Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict cited the scene in which the children <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> kind of person the new student is as the greatest moment in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Right wing {{commentators}} {{opposed the}} idea of Planet Relief, including Keith Waterhouse who said in the Daily Mail before the show was cancelled that, [...] "If the idea is still developing, {{we can only hope}} it gets lost in the darkroom.

500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

500|$|Colin Jacobson {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide website complained about {{its lack of}} {{sharpness}} and commented, [...] "Frankly, I'm {{at a loss to}} understand how such an unattractive video hit the shelves". He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna and I can only <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it was like to actually be there. As for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E
500|$|Women debtors were {{housed in}} rooms over the tap room. The {{rooms in the}} barracks (the men's rooms) were [...] square and [...] high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share. Apart from the bed, prisoners were {{expected}} to provide their own furniture. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: [...] "170persons have been confined at one time within these walls, making an average of more than four persons in each room—which are not ten feet square!!!
