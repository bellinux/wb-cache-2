In this process, the first and the second cycles of studies (bachelor and masters level) are restructured having into account the <b>European</b> <b>orientations,</b> not only at the curricular plan level, but also, as far as the definition of the competences to be developed, in each one of these cycles of studies, is concerned...|$|R

Therefore, this study investigates whether the link between customer equity drivers (value equity, brand equity and relationship equity) and loyalty intentions is sensitive to the cultural environment. A sample of 1553 Chinese and 1085 Dutch consumers in the banking and supermarket industries reveals that all three customer equity drivers exert a greater impact in Western than in Eastern cultures. This study also shows that Eastern consumers in general have higher loyalty intentions than Western consumers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} has the objective {{to focus the}} attention on a specific dimension of the scholastic experience of foreign and autochthonous students {{that is to say}} that of the school as a place where to create cross-cultural relations. The choice to focus on this area answers the requirements to examine an aspect of the scholastic experience of foreign and Italian students still not much investigated, but that today is quite meaningful. Indeed, is characterized in an increasing way by a plural experience – in the classrooms there are a multiplicity of languages, cultural backgrounds and differentiated levels – and is at the centre of the issue {{of the quality of the}} future living together in the multi-ethnic society, as a key institution for the promotion of social cohesion, as well as the acquisition of the necessary competences for the economic and political integration of the citizens of tomorrow (Ambrosini, 2008; Cesareo, 2008). The perspective of cross- cultural teaching is seen as central within the <b>European</b> <b>orientations</b> and the Italian regulations, because the migrations can represent a precious resource on a cultural and educational level only if they are integrated in a continuous process of cross-cultural exchange (Bauman, 1998; 2000; MPI, 2007; Council of Europe, 2008; Commission of the European Communities, 2008; Nesse network, 2008; Giovannini, 2008) ...|$|R

Exploring the domestic dimension of these countries’ accession provides insights into policy-making, party strategies, and party interaction in the post-communist context. The key objective of the project is to examine a number of factors inspired by the Western experience that drive the responses of political parties in regard to European integration. More specifically, the relevance of parties’ (1) ideology, (2) relations to electorates, and (3) interactions within the party system make the purpose of investigation here. First, the role of ideology is scrutinised across the CEE region using statistical methods as well as a combination of party manifestos and expert survey data. The main conclusion to be drawn from the CEE analysis is that parties’ ideological makeup represents a necessary yet insufficient consideration for how parties react to Europe. Therefore, the thesis suggests that in order to arrive at a more compelling explanation of parties’ EU attitudes, the importance of electoral links and competition for office needs to be factored into the discussion, alongside political ideology. Given a series of methodological constraints and opportunities, the dynamic interaction between these three factors in influencing parties’ European stances is assessed in the case of Romania. This in-depth study relies on secondary literature, different opinion polls, and qualitative information from various party and media materials in order to map five Romanian political parties ideologically, establish their party-type, and review their <b>European</b> <b>orientations.</b> The overall conclusion of the Romanian case study is that only the interplay between the three features - parties’ ideology, their relationship with voters, and inter-party strategies - can offer a reliable guide to the positions adopted by political parties toward EU integration...|$|R

As {{a policy}} area that remains {{primarily}} national {{in control and}} <b>orientation,</b> <b>European</b> co-operation in education policy has attracted relatively little attention from a political perspective. This is particularly true {{where there is a}} direct engagement with the notion of ‘Europeanisation’. This paper considers the motivations for and implications of increased cooperation in higher education (HE), taking as its main case study a current proposal for European universities to move towards a common core curriculum for the teaching of European Studies. This proposal, although not formally an initiative of the institutions of the European Union, receives support from the European Commission through its funding of the Thematic Network in Political Science, which is driving the core curriculum initiative...|$|R
