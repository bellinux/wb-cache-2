40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} feed <b>form</b> and <b>grinding</b> intensity of the pig diet and the interaction between both on the particulate matter (PM) concentrations inside a pig nursery and the growth performances of weanling pigs. Four diets were compared: finely ground meal, coarsely ground meal, finely ground pellets, and coarsely ground pellets. Four weaning rounds with 144 pigs per weaning round, divided over 4 identical compartments, were monitored. Within each weaning round, each compartment was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments. A hammer mill with a screen of 1. 5 or 6 mm was used to grind the ingredients of the finely ground and coarsely ground feeds, respectively. Indoor concentrations of the following PM fractions were measured: PM that passes through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cutoff at 10 (PM 10), 2. 5 (PM 2. 5), or 1 (PM 1) μm aerodynamic diameter, respectively (USEPA, 2004). Feeding pelleted diets instead of meal diets gave rise to higher PM 10 (P < 0. 001), PM 2. 5 (P < 0. 001), and PM 1 (P < 0. 001) concentrations. Grinding intensity had an effect only on PM 10 (P < 0. 05) concentrations. No interaction between feed <b>form</b> and <b>grinding</b> intensity was found {{for any of the}} PM fractions. Interactions (P < 0. 05) between feed <b>form</b> and <b>grinding</b> intensity on ADFI and ADG were found.
