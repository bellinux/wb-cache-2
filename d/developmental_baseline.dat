40|$|Experience has a {{profound}} influence on how sound is processed in the brain. Yet {{little is known}} about how enriched experiences interact with developmental processes to shape neural processing of sound. We examine this question as part of a large cross-sectional study of auditory brainstem development involving more than 700 participants, 213 of whom were classified as musicians. We hypothesized that experience-dependent processes piggyback on developmental processes, resulting in a waxing-and-waning effect of experience that tracks with the undulating <b>developmental</b> <b>baseline.</b> This hypothesis led to the prediction that experience-dependent plasticity would be amplified during periods when developmental changes are underway (i. e., early and later in life) and that the peak in experience-dependent plasticity would coincide with the developmental apex for each subcomponent of the auditory brainstem response. Consistent with our predictions, we reveal that musicians have heightened response features at distinctive times in the life span that coincide with periods of developmental change and climax. The effect of musicianship is also quite specific: we find that only select components of auditory brainstem activity are affected, with musicians having heightened function for onset latency, high frequency phase-locking, and response consistency, and with little effect observed for other measures, including lower frequency phase-locking and non-stimulus-related activity. By showing that musicianship imparts a neural signature that is especially evident during childhood and old age, our findings reinforce the idea that the nervous system’s response to sound is chiseled by how a person interacts with his specific auditory environment, with the effect of the environment wielding its greatest influence during certain privileged windows of development...|$|E
40|$|THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS' CONCERNS REGARDING THE USE OFTHERAPEUTIC STAFF SUPPORT (TSS) IN THE SCHOOL SETTINGMary C. Desmone, EdDUniversity of Pittsburgh [2005]The {{purpose of}} this study was to give voice to the special {{education}} teachers' concerns regarding the use of TSS in their programs. How would special education teachers' respond if they were given the opportunity to describe their concerns? They responded eagerly and thoughtfully. The teachers' in this study were providing services to students in Autism, Life Skills, and Emotional Support programs at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels. The study employed a mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology including the developmental, expansion, and triangulation of various data. The Stages of Concern questionnaire was utilized to form a <b>developmental</b> <b>baseline</b> of information about the responding teachers. Interviews were conducted and a rubric was developed which provided an expansion of the understanding from the questionnaire. Observations were completed and assessed against the rubric's components. A triangulation of these three data collection methods enabled the researcher to write stories depicting the teachers' experiences. Sixty-five teachers completed the demographics and Stages of Concern questionnaire. The most significant finding in the demographics was the lack of training prior to TSS being introduced into their classroom. Results from the questionnaire indicated that the highest level of concern for most of the responding teachers' was Stage 5 -Collaboration. Thirteen teachers were interviewed and asked to describe their most effective and least effect experiences and to imagine an ideal utilization of the service. From their input, a rubric was developed to depict the continuum of ineffective, effective, and ideal utilization in the components of Professionalism, Preparation, Technique, and Environment. Nine observations were conducted and assessed using the rubric. The ratings found three observations in the ineffective, four in the effective, and two in the ideal categories. Using the data from the interviews and observations, stories were written describing ineffective, effective, and ideal utilization of TSS in the school setting. Implications were found for educational policy, teachers' contracts, agency system changes, training, and planning and implementation of TSS in the school setting. The teachers identified training in the roles of TSS, utilization of TSS, and collaboration with TSS as their priorities...|$|E
40|$|Five bivariate {{distributions}} of wing dimensions of Drosophila melanogaster were measured, in flies 1) subjected to four defined environmental regimes during development, 2) taken directly from nature in seven U. S. states, 3) selected in ten populations {{for change in}} wing form, and 4) sampled from 21 long inbred wild-type lines. Environmental stresses during development altered both wing size and the ratios of wing dimensions, but regardless of treatment all wing dimensions fell near a common allometric baseline in each bivariate distribution. The wings of wild-caught flies from seven widely separated localities, and of their laboratory-reared offspring, also fell along the same baselines. However, when flies were selected divergently for lateral offset from these <b>developmental</b> <b>baselines,</b> response to selection was rapid in every case. The mean divergence in offset between oppositely selected lines was 14. 68 SD of the base population offset, after only 15 generations of selection at 20 %. Measurements of 21 isofemale lines, founded from wild-caught flies and maintained in small populations for at least 22 years, showed large reductions in phenotypic variance of offsets within lines, but a large increase in the variance among lines. The variance of means of isofemale lines within collection localities was ten times the variance of means among localities of newly established wild lines. These observations show that much additive genetic variance exists for individual dimensions within the wing, such that bivariate developmental patterns can be changed in any direction by selection or by drift. The relative invariance of the allometric baselines of wing morphology in nature is most easily explained {{as the result of}} continuous natural selection around a local optimum of functional design...|$|R

An eight-year old girl （Second grade year in Japanese School）, who was diagnosed to have autism and mild mental retardation, was involved in this study. <b>Baseline</b> <b>developmental</b> status was FIQ 63 （VIQ 75, PIQ 57 ） with WISC-III and receptive vocabulary was equivalent to 6 years and 1 month old with PVT. Receptive and productive syntax ability was equivalent to first half of 3 years old children （Stage 4 - 2 by S-S language developmental tests） and dissociation between syntax ability and other aspects of language development was observed. A training program was planned to make her use Japanese syntactic particles （Stage 5 - 2 by S-S） during Aug. 2006 to Nov 2006. T-QAR was evaluated before and after training to evaluate her communication ability. Three months after the commencement of this training program, she could pass Stage 5 - 2 and total score of T-QAR improved from 177 （Before training: equivalent to 4 year-old score）to 220 （Aftert raining: equivalent to 5 year-old score）.

MethodsRetrospective case–control study. We included patients 1 month to 21 years of age {{at the time of}} convulsive SE. We compared the characteristics of patients with SE (cases) versus those without SE (controls) using two different seizure duration thresholds: 5 min and 30 min. Results 1062 patients (54 % males) were enrolled. The median (p 25 –p 75) age at the episode was 6. 4 (2. 8 – 11. 8) years. 444 (41. 8 %) patients had SE 5 and 149 (14 %) patients had SE 30. On univariate analysis, risk factors for SE were not markedly different when considering a 5 or 30 min threshold. Compared to their respective controls patients with both SE 5 and SE 30 were younger at the age of seizure onset and at the age of SE, were on more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline, had a higher rate of changes in AEDs in the three months prior to the episode, {{were more likely to have}} <b>developmental</b> delay at <b>baseline,</b> and a higher mortality rate. A higher baseline seizure frequency, and a higher increase in seizure frequency prior to the index episode were seen only in SE 5.

40|$|The lamprey is a {{primitive}} vertebrate that recovers behaviorally from spinal cord transection. This {{is accompanied by}} directionally and synaptically specific axonal regeneration. Whether this involves cellular proliferation, more specifically neurogenesis, is unknown. ^ Uninjured CNS. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into uninjured 4 – 5 year old larvae as well a few animals undergoing metamorphosis and young adults. Animals incorporated BrdU for 4 hours, 1, 6, 20, or 52 days and then studied for BrdU immunohistochemistry. In some cases by sections were double-labeled for BrdU and either glial keratin or neurofilament. A mitotic index (MI) was calculated {{as the percentage of}} nuclei that were BrdU-labeled. MIs were much higher in summer than winter. There was no correlation between age and MI within the range of <b>developmental</b> stages examined. <b>Baseline</b> MIs in the rhombencephalon and spinal cord were approximately 0. 05 % and 0. 10 % respectively, highest in the ependyma, but with many labeled cells in non-ependymal regions. During peak summer weeks, almost all of the additional mitosis in the rhombencephalon was in the ependyma but this was not true in the spinal cord. BrdU-labeled cells were often keratin-positive but never neurofilament-positive. ^ Spinal cord transection. Transected larval lamprey that had recovered for 2, 7, 14, or 21 days were injected with BrdU and prepared for immunohistochemistry. This induced additional proliferation that was greatest close to the lesion, but also was seen in the rhombencephalon. However, transection-induced proliferation was much higher in winter than summer. Most of the added proliferation seen in the spinal cord was in the ependyma. BrdU-labeled cells were often keratin-positive but never neurofilament-positive, even after 5 weeks of incorporation. ^ Conclusions. (1) While gliogenesis is greater in summer than winter, injury-induced gliogenesis is greater in winter than summer. (2) Neurogenesis is uncommon in the lamprey CNS, at baseline or after transection. ...|$|R
40|$|Stimulation {{in early}} {{childhood}} can alleviate adverse effects of poverty. In a community-randomised trial, we implemented 2 home-based interventions, each serving as an attention control for the other. One group received an integrated household intervention package (IHIP), whereas the other group received an early child development (ECD) intervention. The primary objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of IHIP on diarrhoea and respiratory infections, the details of which are described elsewhere. Here, we present the impact of the ECD intervention on early childhood development indicators.; In this non-blinded community-randomised trial, an ECD intervention, adapted from the Peruvian government's National Wawa Wasi ECD programme, was implemented in 25 rural Peruvian Andean communities. We enrolled 534 children aged 6 - 35  months, from 50 communities randomised 1 : 1 into ECD and IHIP communities. In ECD communities, trained fieldworkers instructed mothers every 3  weeks over the 12  months study, to stimulate and interact with their children and to use standard programme toys. IHIP communities received an improved stove and hygiene promotion. Using a nationally validated ECD evaluation instrument, all children were assessed at baseline and 12  months later for overall performance on age-specific developmental milestones which fall into 7 <b>developmental</b> domains.; At <b>baseline,</b> ECD-group and IHIP-group children performed similarly in all domains. After 12  months, data from 258 ECD-group and 251 IHIP-group children could be analysed. The proportion of children scoring above the mean in their specific age group was significantly higher in the ECD group in all domains (range: 12 - 23 %-points higher than IHIP group). We observed the biggest difference in fine motor skills (62 % vs 39 % scores above the mean, OR: 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 7 to 3. 9).; The home-based ECD intervention effectively improved child development overall across domains and separately by investigated domain. Home-based strategies could be a promising component of poverty alleviation programmes seeking to improve developmental outcomes among rural Peruvian children.; ISRCTN 28191222; results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nutrition care in {{hospitals}} is often haphazard, and malnourished patients {{are not always}} readily identified and do not receive the care they require. The Integrated Nutrition Pathway for Acute Care (INPAC) is an algorithm designed to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of malnutrition in medical and surgical patients. More- 2 -Eat is {{an evaluation of the}} implementation of INPAC care activities (e. g. screening) in five diverse medical units from different hospitals in Canada. The primary purpose is to understand how tailored implementation affects INPAC uptake and factors that impact this implementation. The principal outcome is a toolkit that can provide guidance to others. Methods This participatory action research uses a before-after time series design to address several research questions focused on implementation and uptake of INPAC (e. g., Does the implementation of INPAC improve the detection of malnutrition? Do nutrition care related knowledge, attitudes and practices scores of unit staff change with the implementation of INPAC?). A six-month <b>developmental</b> phase where <b>baseline</b> data were collected is followed by a twelve-month implementation phase and a three-month sustainability phase. Qualitative and quantitative data are collected concurrently, and to address key research questions, these data are merged. Quantitative data are collected on-site by trained local dietitians and include chart audits of nutrition care practices and a more detailed assessment of recruited patients on quality of life, disability, frailty, food intake and barriers to food intake. Thirty-day post discharge follow up for these patients occurs by researchers via a telephone interview at three time points within baseline and implementation phases, to ascertain the same and other outcomes (e. g. readmission to hospital). Qualitative data include focus groups and key informant interviews completed by researchers, monthly teleconferences among the sites and site-completed forms that track implementation activities. Resource utilization of dietitian time for various care activities (e. g. assessment) and staff time to assist patients at mealtimes is also collected. Discussion More- 2 -Eat provides an example of how implementation can be tailored when a care algorithm is embedded into routine practice. The project also highlights important learning points with respect to data collection and techniques to support implementation.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of early childhood}} development (ECD) is undeniable and child health experts internationally recognise that developmental care is vital to improve long-term health and wellbeing outcomes. A key challenge to the provision of qualitydevelopmental care in remote Australian Aboriginal communities has been the absence of culturally appropriate, structured developmental screening tools. Also, Aboriginal Health Workers (AHWs), recognised as key staff in this context, and a high proportion of other remote health practitioners, do not have adequate training {{in the area of}} ECD. The TRAK study aimed to design, implement and evaluate a capacity building program in developmental practice for AHWs. This included: a) the cultural adaptation of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ- 3) for use in remote Aboriginal communities; b)  the design and trialing of an ECD training program; and c) the implementation of the culturally adapted ASQ- 3 into standard health service practice, in remote Aboriginal health services. A case study evaluation framework was adopted, utilising mixed methods, including interviews, observations and medical record audits. Two case study sites in the Northern Territory were selected - one remote health centre in a coastal ‘Top End’ community and one in Central Australia. Purposive samples of AHWs, key community informants, and Aboriginal parents, from the two sites, as well as ECD experts were included in the study. All children under 5 years of age, resident in the study communities, were included in an audit of medical records to determine <b>baseline</b> <b>developmental</b> practice of remote health staff. The study findings demonstrated that the cross cultural adaptation of the ASQ- 3  developmental screening tool (the ASQ 3 -TRAK tool) was considered highly acceptable and relevant to parents, AHWs and ECD experts. The training needs analysis identified gaps in existing knowledge and practice, through self report, practice observation and the medical record audits. The customised training program was delivered successfully and valued by all participants with demonstrated improvements in practitioner skills, knowledge, competence and confidence to identify and manage developmental difficulties in young children and promote child development. Despite the acceptability and value of the developmental screening tool and the ECD training, the integration of the adapted ASQ- 3 into routine health service did not occur as intended. Challenges to the uptake and ongoing use of the adapted tool were identified in three broad themes: leadership and governance, workforce support, and health centre structures. This study sought to advance understanding of some of the critical factors needed to build the capacity of AHWs and other remote health practitioners in providing quality developmental care to remote-dwelling Aboriginal children. The findings identified key barriers and potential solutions to improving developmental practice in this challenging service context. These include effective and culturally appropriate practitioner training in ECD, the availability of a culturally appropriate developmental screening tool, and service requirements for its routine use. These findings have implications for policy, practice and further research to improve the developmental outcomes of Australian Aboriginal children...|$|R
