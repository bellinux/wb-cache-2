5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E
25|$|Filbert's {{plans for}} Nina have changed when she grew older. Instead of a {{professional}} music career, he wanted his daughter to earn college degree, and {{to join him in}} the United States to find work. She took up Accountancy at Miriam College, since she was good at numbers. Her father insisted that she would take up Law as a latter course. Because of too much love for singing, she disobeyed her father and joined different bands. He eventually gave up on trying to stop her, and <b>just</b> <b>told</b> her to maintain good grades. She did get good grades, and was even a consistent dean's lister.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had less}} than {{three and a half}} hours to bowl England out for victory and their spinners gave them 50 overs to do so. Bob Barber hit 34 off 37 balls with 3 fours and a six, but Geoff Boycott carried his bat through to stumps with 63 not out. Boycott pushed a ball from Peter Philpott away with his hand during his innings, but Brian Booth refused to appeal for handled the ball and Wally Grout <b>just</b> <b>told</b> him not to do it again. John Edrich (37) and Ken Barrington (38) also hit sixes and Mike Smith saw out the last half hour as England made 186/3 to ensure a draw.|$|E

25|$|In {{the very}} cold winter of 1794–95, with the French army {{demanding}} {{more and more}} bread, same was getting scarce in Paris as was wood to keep houses warm, and in an echo of the October 1789 March on Versailles, on 1 April 1795 (12 Germinal III) a mostly female crowd marched on the Convention calling for bread. But no Convention member sympathized, they <b>just</b> <b>told</b> the women to return home. Again in May a crowd of 20,000 men and 40,000 women invaded the Convention and even killed a deputy in the halls, but again they {{failed to make the}} Convention take notice of the needs of the lower classes. Instead, the Convention banned women from all political assemblies, and deputies who had solidarized with this insurrection were sentenced to death: such allegiance between parliament and street fighting was no longer tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Major Remington then {{ordered his}} squad {{to charge the}} Confederate force, which Dagwell had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> him must be an entire brigade of Confederate cavalry and had {{correctly}} estimated as being a minimum of 2,000 men. The advance Confederates broke {{into the woods and}} Dagwell followed, only to soon find that he was alone. When he came out to the point the New Yorkers had formed their line, he found only five Union men but also saw several dead and wounded Confederates, including a dead Confederate major beside the road. Major John H. Whitaker, commander of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry was killed during the action. Sergeant Charles A. Hartwell stated that the New Yorkers killed 5 Confederates and took 14 prisoners in the initial action. Hartwell soon found himself with about a dozen men, including Major Remington, cut off from the other Union troops. Remington and a few others, including Sergeant H. O. Morris, in the face of overwhelming numbers, had retreated from the nearby hill to which Remington had moved most of the men after their initial charge. When he saw the Union movement, Hampton thought they were trying to position themselves to attack the rear of his force and sent a squadron to outflank them, virtually surrounding the majority of the Union men. Sergeant Morris shot a Confederate officer who assaulted Major Remington during the melee that ensued during the fight for escape of the New Yorkers not trapped on the hill.|$|E

500|$|The episode then cuts {{back to the}} Griffin family household, with Peter {{immediately}} rehashing {{the argument}} between him and Chris that first started in [...] "Blue Harvest", a joke grounded {{in the fact that}} Chris' voice actor, Seth Green, is one of the creators and producers of the stop motion comedy series Robot Chicken. Peter begins by suggesting that Robot Chicken {{would never be able to}} top the story he had <b>just</b> <b>told.</b> Hearing this, Chris defends Robot Chicken. Peter continues to poke at Chris and finally states that he [...] "may have more time to tell another story" [...] entitled Without a Paddle, a critically panned movie in which Seth Green starred.

500|$|The {{friction}} between Shea and Marshall, which had begun when Shea was at OMSF, continued after {{he moved to}} his new position. He became deeply involved in supporting George Mueller's effort to impose the idea of [...] "all up" [...] testing of the Saturn V rocket on the unwilling engineers at Marshall. Von Braun's approach to engineering was a conservative one, emphasizing the incremental testing of components. But the tight schedule of the Apollo program didn't allow for this slow and careful process. What Mueller and Shea proposed was to test the Saturn V as one unit on its very first flight, and Marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963. When later asked how he and Mueller had managed to sell the idea to von Braun, Shea responded that [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>told</b> him that's the way it's going to be, finally." ...|$|E

When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built. [...] "To say we were skint," [...] he wrote in 1993, [...] "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole." [...] He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she <b>just</b> <b>told</b> Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} begins, Toby gets {{called by the}} D.C. police to {{identify}} a dead homeless man. It turns out the man (a Korean War veteran from the 2/7) was wearing a coat that Toby donated to Goodwill, and Toby had left his business card in it. The event stays with him, and he decides to trace down the man's next of kin. The only relative he can find is a brother, also homeless. Using {{the influence of the}} president's office, he arranges a military funeral at Arlington. President Bartlet is informed about Toby’s transgression, but can only muster limited indignation and jocularly asks if the country is still in NATO. To the president's concern that this could create precedent for other veterans to come forward, Toby replies [...] "I can only hope, sir." [...] Mrs Landingham, who has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> Charlie about losing her twin sons in the Vietnam War, joins Toby and the veteran's brother at the funeral.|$|E

And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he <b>just</b> <b>told</b> me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band was {{released}} in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records.

The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin.

She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only <b>just</b> <b>told</b> the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless."
