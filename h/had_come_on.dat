5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} {{professional}} debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2004–05 season against Nice. Lyon won the match 1–0 with a goal from Giovane Élber, a few minutes after Ben Arfa <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on.</b> After making a few substitute appearances, he made his first start on 11 September 2004 in a 2–1 victory over Rennes playing 56 minutes. Ben Arfa scored his first professional goal two months later on 10 November in a Coupe de la Ligue match against Lille, converting from the penalty spot in extra time to give Lyon a 2–1 lead, though Lille scored two late goals, beating Lyon 3–2. He made his UEFA Champions League debut in a group stage match against Manchester United coming on as a substitute for Sidney Govou.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four {{successive}} league games. However, {{he could only}} score another two goals {{during the rest of}} the campaign to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth successive home victory and a final league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished and he left after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E

5|$|By December 1941, the M2A1, M2A2 and M2A3 {{were used}} for {{training}} only. The majority of M2A4s, which went to the US Army, were also used only for training between 1940 and 1942. The U.S. Marine Corps ordered M3 Stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in 1940, but as the new tank was not yet in production, it received 36 M2A4s, after which point production of the M3 <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> line. Many of these tanks were deployed during the Battle of Guadalcanal while assigned to A Company, 1st Tank Battalion, where they and M3 Stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units. Their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the Marines, either in disabling Japanese bunkers or using canister shot against Japanese attacks. In defensive engagements, the M2A4s and Stuarts would deploy in pairs, so they could cover each other with machine gun fire against Japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges.|$|E
5|$|Fowler's first {{involvement}} with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, {{when he was an}} unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3–1 win in a first round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would {{have been one of the}} biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2–1 win. He scored twice in a thrilling 3–3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|The West Indian's {{had begun}} to {{experience}} difficulties in {{the final years of}} the 1960s. The Indian defeat <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they played well against Australia on the 1972–73 tour, they lost 2:1. In the Fourth Test in Guyana they fell to a 10-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings. The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues. In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests. The West Indians played Andy Roberts and Michael Holding in both games, though India played well enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures. Their victory in the second involved a record 406-run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down.|$|E

5|$|Dickov {{suffered}} several injuries {{over the}} course of the season, including a back problem, a knee injury and a toe injury, the latter sidelining him for four months. Dickov made nine starts and seven substitute appearances in 2006–07, but failed to score a single goal. In May 2007 he announced his interest in pursuing a coaching role when he retires. He was transfer listed by Manchester City in August. He joined Crystal Palace on a three-month loan on 31 August 2007. He played his first game for the Eagles in a friendly against Crystal Palace Baltimore, Crystal Palace's American counterparts, on Friday 7 September, playing the full 90 minutes. On 31 January 2008, Dickov joined Blackpool managed by Simon Grayson on loan until May. Two days later he scored on his debut for Blackpool, what proved to be the winning goal in the Seasiders' 2–1 victory against Leicester City, one of his former clubs, at Bloomfield Road. He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as a 70th-minute substitute and scored the winning goal in the 89th minute. It was his first goal since 2 January 2006. He went on to score five goals in his first five appearances for the club, and on 4 March he was named as the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Fans Championship Player of the Month for February. By the end of his loan, Dickov had scored six goals in eleven appearances. He returned to Manchester City after his loan before then being released at the end of the season.|$|E

This led to the scheduled sailing being cancelled.|$|E

For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s. Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, harpsichord, electric piano, organ, mellotron and bass guitar, as well as mandolin and Moog synthesiser, now confined himself to bass onstage.|$|E

He played 85 times for Wales, {{making him the}} second highest capped player only behind goalkeeper Neville Southall who made 92 {{appearance}}s. Speed captained Wales on 44 occasions. His first appearance for the national side <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> 20 May 1990 in a 1–0 friendly win against Costa Rica at Ninian Park as a second-half replacement for Glyn Hodges. He did not score until his 27th cap, a 3–2 away defeat in Moldova in a Euro 96 qualifier on 12 October 1994. Speed's first appearance as captain was during his 46th cap, a 3–0 away win in Malta on 3 June 1998.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} years Wang realised a far-reaching development plan. He tried to bring more workers into the booming Manchurian economy. Most <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> a temporary basis, returning to their homes in north China in winter. The Manchurian government now encouraged them to bring women and children, and settle permanently. As an incentive, they were made eligible for reduced fares on all Chinese-owned railways in Manchuria, received funds to build a dwelling and were promised total ownership {{after five years of}} continuous occupation. Rent for the land was canceled for the first years. Most were sent to the interior of Manchuria, where they reclaimed land for agriculture, or worked in forestry or mines. Between 1924-29 the amount of land under tillage increased from 20 to 35 million acres (80,000 to 140,000km²).|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer {{he was a}} {{right-handed}} opening batsman and got {{few opportunities}} to represent Victoria {{because they had a}} prolific pair in Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford. In the four first-class matches that he was picked in, two of them in the Sheffield Shield, it was as a middle order batsman. He made the most of his chance in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1926/27 when he scored 220 of Victoria's 552 first innings runs. Mitchell then dismissed Tasmanian Alfred Watson twice with the ball and also took three catches to round off a good all round performance. His only other wicket at first-class level <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> his debut against New Zealand and was All Blacks rugby player Charlie Oliver. Despite Mitchell's efforts in the Tasmania match, he wasn't picked for Victoria ever again.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{got plenty}} of {{practice}} in their last ODI of the group stage, but were found lacking after resting their best bowlers, Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori. Nehra and Pathan, India's opening bowlers, were taken for runs early on as they sought for wickets but the openers Fleming and Astle escaped, adding 44 in the first 10 overs before Fleming let himself loose {{with a couple of}} aerial shots on the off side to take ten off an over from Pathan. Agarkar, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> for Nehra earlier, then had Astle caught behind for 11, but Vincent and Fleming continued to punish the bowling, {{and by the end of}} 15 overs they were 81 for 1 – Nehra having conceded 35 in five overs. However, once again Agarkar was responsible for a breakthrough, running out Fleming with a good throw after having picked up the ball in his follow-through.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, he {{was dropped}} from the squad for the FA Cup final, a {{decision}} which manager Alex Ferguson later admitted {{was one of the}} hardest of his career. His very last appearance in a United shirt came {{on the last day of}} the season, 8 May 1994, when United drew 0–0 at home with Coventry City. He had played 461 times for them in all competitions, scoring 99 goals, and was widely regarded as one of their finest players ever. The last of his goals had come in the FA Cup semi-final replay against Oldham. In the league, his final goal <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> the opening day of the 1993–94 season (15 August 1993) in a 2–0 win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. He had also scored a European Cup goal that season, in the second round first leg tie against Turkish champions Galatasaray in a 3–3 draw at Old Trafford.|$|E
25|$|Cluff {{continued}} his somewhat unusual tactics in 1900, {{when he took}} a group of students on an expedition to Mexico to explore the lands of the Book of Mormon and discover Zarahemla. At the Mexican border, Cluff and his group were met by Heber J. Grant, a member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Grant disapproved of the expedition and asked Cluff to go back, but he refused. What followed was an eighteen-month adventure through jungle, full of illness, and including a stay in Mexican prison. Cluff and his group eventually returned to the university in 1902. For another two years he served the school successfully, seeing it double in size. However, Walter Wolfe, {{one of the men who}} <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> the Mexican expedition, accused Cluff of mismanagement, misrepresentation, misappropriation of funds, and immorality, all having allegedly occurred in Mexico. Although Cluff was cleared of all charges, the damage done to his reputation required the Board to hire a new president.|$|E
