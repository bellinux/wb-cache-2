500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> things interesting. A wise man once told me that if {{you have to have an}} origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't {{look back}} on the past because I like to live in the present. I know this makes some people think I {{probably}} never cared, but I need my freedom and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> moving." [...] - Juliette Binoche ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{most severe}} legal {{challenge}} came in 1984 with the Costigan Commission alleging (using the codename of [...] "the squirrel", renamed [...] "the Goanna" [...] in media reports) {{that he was}} involved in tax evasion and organised crime, including drug trafficking. He successfully counter-attacked the Commission with the assistance of his counsel Malcolm Turnbull. In 1987 the charges were formally dismissed by Federal Attorney-General Lionel Bowen. Mystery still surrounds Packer's receipt of a [...] "loan" [...] of A$225,000 in cash from Brian Ray, a bankrupt Queensland businessman. When questioned about this transaction at the Costigan Royal Commission Packer said [...] "...I like cash. I have a squirrel mentality. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> money in cash. It {{is by no means the}} most cash I ever had in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish Missis wouldn't touch dem ar. <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{my things}} where I knows whar {{to go to}} 'em," [...] said Dinah, rather decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Walkirk," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "you are a trump!" [...] In my exuberant {{satisfaction}} I {{would have}} clapped {{him on the}} back; {{but it would not}} do to be so familiar with an under-study, and besides I did not wish him to understand the extent of my delight at the result of his mission. That sort of thing <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my head {{pretty clear}} when I'm a-talkin' to you, Muster Girdlestone. Out o' your office I'll drink to further orders, but I won't do {{business}} and muddle {{myself at the}} same time. When d'ye want me to start?" ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mastered by Guy at The Exchange was {{the first}} Max Tundra record to use vocals. In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media he explained that [...] "The songs are extremely different from those on the first record. When I was writing Some Best Friend, I thought {{of all sorts of}} weird and wonderful machines and instruments I could use to make noises, but singing never occurred to me. I had never considered using my voice on any Max Tundra record ever, but hey, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> things varied, so this time round I figured what the hell!" [...] Max Tundra found it difficult to write lyrics as well, saying [...] "I'm getting to grips with writing lyrics, but it is somewhat more difficult than anything I've done before... The lyrics themselves are taking ages to write-- it's something I'm not used to." [...] The other vocalist on the album is Becky Jacobs who is Max Tundra's sister. The album's title is literal; it was mastered by Guy Davie at a studio named The Exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} won't. I {{have only been}} joking all the time, though I do half believe in this old song, as my {{ancestors}} did before me. I mean, that as I thought I had <b>to</b> die, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up the ancient custom and sing it first. It encouraged my spirits. But where are we going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; money. Why shouldn't you pay me money? <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> three ponies, {{and to have}} Miss Tickle's {{sister to}} come and live with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you; <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the picture," [...] {{she said}} by and by, {{and gave him}} a level glance. [...] "I suppose you knew my father well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brownlow {{seemed to}} think this totally irrelevant, and observed, [...] "When I have nice things, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them nice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{my teeth}} and claws sharpened,' said Percy; but one wants repose at home. That burgomaster is my model.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No matter, no matter," [...] {{said the}} old man, turning to gaze at the {{tombstone}} before quitting the place. [...] "Some people are fond of having secrets. I've got one, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were quite}} right. He is at my house--and <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him at Trimley Deen; but I am afraid {{he and the}} other {{servants}} might not get on well together?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Campbell's {{music is}} characterised by a lo-fi, {{economical}} approach; {{she has said}} that [...] "Working with basic tools, mainly an 8-track cassette recorder, a telecaster and a drum machine forced me to be economical and inventive, and set an aesthetic blueprint for the way <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> things stark and urgent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A surface change," [...] she laughed. [...] "Munich and London {{account for}} it. I'd run wild, you know, {{when you saw}} me last. But there's no {{difference}} underneath. You're the same too, and that's what <b>I</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my old friend. You must promise you won't alter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because private misery {{is better}} than public humiliation. Because {{it is easier to}} suffer for a mistake than to own to it. Because also <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you in my sight, and to know that you cannot go back to him." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{it is well}} I {{should bring}} this story to an end here, for if I make any attempt at telling what came to Nathaniel Peacock and myself after that, then am <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on until he who has begun to read will lay down the story because of weariness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{like my own}} house. They've {{wanted me}} {{to come up here}} often enough, but I'm {{satisfied}} where I am. It's quiet down there, and, when I get through for the day, I can read. And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my family together. Cynthy and Frank always sleep at home, and Jombateeste eats with me. You remember Jombateeste?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{this out}} I {{promise to be}} twenty years younger. But no one is to know it but you. Do you think you will know it? <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the secret <b>to</b> myself altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|Grygera's {{contract}} with Fulham {{was up for}} renewal {{at the end of}} the 2011-12 season. Manager Martin Jol, said, [...] "Hopefully he can prove himself before the end of August. If he proves he's fit <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no," [...] I {{said with}} a little shiver. [...] "I would never wear them, Aunt Winnifred. <b>I</b> should feel <b>like</b> a ghost if I did. Put {{everything}} back just as we found it--only her portrait. <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mother, don't cry {{and talk}} so. Haven't I got enough to vex me without that? What's th' use o' telling me things as I only {{think too much}} on every day? If I didna think on 'em, why should I do as I do, for the sake o' keeping things {{together}} here? But I hate to be talking where it's no use: <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my breath for doing i'stead o' talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but {{the glory}}!" [...] Fulkerson insinuated with impudent persiflage. [...] "I hadn't {{got to the}} glory yet, because it's hard to {{estimate}} it; but put the glory at the lowest figure, Mr. Dryfoos, and {{add it to the}} twenty-five thousand, and you've got an annual income from 'Every Other Week' of dollars enough to construct a silver railroad, double-track, from this office to the moon. I don't mention any of the sister planets because <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> within bounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{tried the}} door it was locked. [...] "Ha!" [...] says Felicia, [...] "I {{wanted you to}} see it for yourself!" [...] More {{suspicious}} proceedings {{on the part of}} my son-in-law! He kept the door constantly locked, and the key in his pocket. When his wife asked him what it meant, he answered: [...] "My study is up there--and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it entirely to myself." [...] After such a reply as that, the preservation of my daughter's dignity permitted but one answer: [...] "Oh, keep it to yourself, by all means!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{watch out}} for my fingers," [...] the miner rejoined. [...] "When you pound her as you've been doing <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see you <b>keep</b> {{your eye on the}} drill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I mean my own {{marriage}} with Lady Mason. We will {{not talk about}} that just at present, and I only mention it to explain that before I do so, I shall settle the property permanently. If you were married I should at once divide it with you. <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the old house myself, till I die--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Macpherson's in Judd Street. <b>I</b> {{suppose he}} <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> among the Scotch. I don't think he ever {{goes out of}} the house, and he's waiting in London till this thing is published." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Carrie, while we're {{talking of}} this: Of course <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> independent, and I don't {{believe in this}} {{business}} of binding yourself to trade with the man that trades with you unless you really want to, but same time: I'd be just as glad if you dealt with Jenson or Ludelmeyer {{as much as you}} ran, instead of Howland & Gould, who go to Dr. Gould every last time, and the whole tribe of 'em the same way. I don't see why I should be paying out my good money for groceries and having them pass it on to Terry Gould!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} so busy, and day after day has brought such {{exciting}} news, good and bad, that I haven't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it up regularly, for father says a diary of {{the years of the}} war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to one's children. The trouble is, I like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what I'd want my children to read. I feel that I shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Outside," [...] {{the captain}} replied. [...] "It {{is the longest}} way, but the safest. The Spaniards hold Middleburg and Tergoes, and have lately {{defeated}} the force from Flushing that endeavoured to capture Tergoes. There are many of our craft {{and some of the}} Spaniards in the passages, and fighting often takes place. It is better to avoid risks of trouble, although it may be a few leagues further round by Walcheren. I am ready to take my share of the fighting when it is needful, and aid in carrying the troops across from Flushing and back, but when I have goods in my hold <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> as well away from it as may be." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{led the way}} to {{my house}} in silence, and rather pleased with myself for the way I had managed the talk, for <b>I</b> <b>like</b> a man <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his self-respect.|$|R
5000|$|Musk {{has said}} that his {{investments}} are, [...] "not {{from the standpoint of}} actually trying to make any investment return... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> just <b>keep</b> an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence". Musk continued, [...] "There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator - there are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is all safe," [...] {{thought the}} Senior, greatly relieved. [...] "Gad! <b>I</b> should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{it from you}} altogether--and from those two poor women, who are as {{innocent}} as unborn babes in the transaction." ...|$|R
