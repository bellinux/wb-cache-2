5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several {{of his family and}} friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Zakuani {{attracted}} interest from West Ham United's youth program. He later tried out for the youth team of Queens Park Rangers, and in 1997, he joined the Arsenal Academy. Zakuani became cocky and brash while not focusing on schoolwork and was released. His off-the-field issues culminated in serious injuries when {{he was involved in}} a crash while riding on a moped that one of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> stolen. Zakuani was unable to play for 18months. After losing interest in soccer and renewing his efforts in school, his teacher and mentor Paul Goodison took him to watch motivational speaker and evangelist Myles Munroe. This inspired Zakuani to renew his commitment to becoming a professional player and, although unsuccessful, he tried out for the senior teams of Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, AZ Alkmaar, and Real Valladolid.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{was born}} in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, the second son of Alfred Thornton Baker, a wealthy upholsterer, and Mary Augusta Pemberton, a socialite. Alfred, known as Bobby to <b>his</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>had</b> played halfback while a student at Princeton University in the 1880s, the same school his father had attended. One of Baker's {{ancestors}} was Francis Rawle, a Quaker who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1688 {{and became one of}} the wealthiest members of the city. Baker was named after his uncle, Dr. Hobart Amory Hare, who was the obstetrician at his birth and president of the Jefferson Medical Hospital in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven, Baker and his twelve-year-old brother Thornton were sent to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Baker's parents divorced in 1907 and both remarried.|$|E

5|$|At the {{succession}} of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard {{was not only the}} first inmate of the prison, but also the first person to escape from it. A popular legend represents the bishop as descending from the window of his cell by a rope which friends had smuggled to him in a flagon of wine. Ranulf gave the wine to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. <b>His</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop's treasure, and the bishop's elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry's brother Robert Curthose, where {{he became one of the}} duke's principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard's trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.|$|E

The car, however, achieved very little success and two years later Alboreto moved up to Formula Three. Wins in the Italian Formula Three championship and a European Formula Three Championship crown in 1980 {{paved the way for the}} Italian's entrance into Formula One with the Tyrrell team.|$|E
25|$|When King Charles {{was brought}} to trial, Burges was the foremost, at great {{personal}} risk, in protesting against the proceeding with his usual freedom and vigour. On 14 January 1649, the day preceding that on which the king was brought from Windsor to be arraigned before the high court of justice, Burges preached at Mercers' Chapel, denouncing the measure in the strongest terms. He and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> taken up {{the cause of the}} parliament, as he declared in the 'Vindication', published while the trial was in progress, 'not to bring his majesty to justice (as some now speak), but to put him in a better capacity to do justice'.|$|E
25|$|Getman had a {{difficult}} childhood in Ukraine, often close to starvation, but {{from the very beginning}} was able to develop his natural artistic talents. After graduating from technical college in 1937, he attended the Kharkiv Art College in order to become a professional artist. Three years later he was called up to join the Red Army, where he served until the end of World War II. Shortly after his return, he was arrested for participating in anti-Soviet propaganda {{as a result of a}} caricature of Stalin one of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> drawn on a cigarette box. He was convicted in January 1946 and sent to the Gulag prison camps in Siberia.|$|E

25|$|In 1837, Echeverría {{founded the}} Asociación de Mayo, {{at the back}} room of his store. The meeting was first viewed favorably by top functionaries of the Rosas government, even though they were {{considered}} suspicious by the Sociedad Popular Restauradora (Rosas' government's political arm). In the same year, the French blockade of the Río de la Plata started, which first for cultural reasons, then political, defined them as anti-Rosas. The threats of the para-military group, the Mazorca, Sastre did not flee to Montevideo, as several of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> done. The government's displeasure and the stopping of imports from France caused the bankruptcy of his bookstore. In 1840, Sastre published a novel, Cartas a Germania.|$|E
25|$|Pavese {{was living}} in Rome when he was called up into the fascist army, but because of his asthma he spent six months in a {{military}} hospital. When he returned to Turin, German troops occupied the streets and most of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> left to fight as partisans. Pavese fled to the hills around Serralunga di Crea, near Casale Monferrato. He took no part in the armed struggle taking place in that area. During the years in Turin, he was the mentor of the young writer and translator Fernanda Pivano, his former student at the Liceo D'Azeglio. Pavese gave her the American edition of Spoon River Anthology, which came out in Pivano's Italian translation in 1943.|$|E
25|$|At the Oratory, two of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> a {{disagreement}} {{and decided to}} fight each other by throwing stones. They being older and stronger than Dominic (his hard work and intelligence had caused him to be promoted from the first form to the second form), physical intervention was not possible. He tried to reason with them but with no positive result. Thus, {{on the day of}} the fight, he went with them to the site where the fight was to take place, and just before they could start, he placed himself between them, and holding up his crucifix, requested that they throw their first stones at him. Ashamed, the two boys gave up their fight. Dominic then persuaded them to go to Confession.|$|E

25|$|Rains argued {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Kilroy and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> {{more or less}} a {{daily routine}} in mind. They went to the beach in the morning and suntanned before lunch. After lunch they went to the beach area behind their hotel for a daily Miss Tanline contest. Once the event was over that afternoon, Kilroy headed to the hotel for a quick nap before planning their trip to Mexico. They left South Padre Island that evening and stopped for dinner at a Sonic Drive-In in Port Isabel, Texas, where they met a group of female students from University of Kansas who were planning to party in Mexico as well. The girls then followed Brent's car from Port Isabel to Brownsville and parked their cars close to the Gateway International Bridge before crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by foot. Kilroy's friends and the Kansas girls spent most of their evening at Sergeant Pepper's night club in Matamoros before the groups went their separate ways. Kilroy and his friends then returned to South Padre Island early the next morning. On March 13, Kilroy and his friends attended another Miss Tanline contest behind the Sheraton. Early in the evening, Kilroy met with one of his former frat brothers at a condo party. At around 10:30p.m. CT, Kilroy and his friends headed back to Matamoros. They parked on the border and crossed by foot again.|$|E
500|$|Until 1890, and {{especially}} after <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> died, Friedrich's work lay in near-oblivion for decades. Yet, by 1890, the symbolism {{in his work}} began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for [...] "painterly effect" [...] and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time.|$|E

In introducing the film for his video anthology Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites from the National Film Board of Canada, American critic Leonard Maltin noted that hockey is [...] "an obsession, a country-wide preoccupation that dominates many lives", particularly those of children. He argued that The Sweater {{is one of the}} National Film Board's best animated works that combined humour with cultural significance.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} at that time, Riley and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> few toys and they amused {{themselves}} with activities. With his mother's aid, Riley began creating plays and theatricals {{which he and}} his friends would practice and perform {{in the back of a}} local grocery store. As he grew older, the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to have their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences. Riley wrote of these early performances in his poem [...] "When We First Played 'Show'," [...] where he referred to himself as [...] "Jamesy." ...|$|E

When MacKaye was 13, he moved to Palo Alto, California for nine months. On his return, <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>had</b> begun taking drugs and drinking.
