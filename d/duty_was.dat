5000|$|Ironically, Ross' {{prima facie}} <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> neither prima facie nor <b>duties.</b> They <b>are</b> not prima facie (which means {{something}} like [...] "appears {{to be at}} first glance") since Ross' prima facie <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> always and everywhere pro tanto reasons in favour of something's being a moral reason. They <b>are</b> not <b>duties</b> since <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> obligations that must be performed under any circumstances. Duties and obligations, strictly speaking, are never outweighed, but Ross' prima facie <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> often outweighed by other factors. This is why Kagan says that Ross was actually talking about pro tanto moral reasons, and not, strictly speaking, about prima facie duties.|$|R

50|$|Second, we have {{imperfect}} <b>duties,</b> which <b>are</b> still {{based on}} pure reason, but which allow for desires {{in how they}} are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this <b>duty</b> <b>is</b> {{not as strong as}} a perfect <b>duty,</b> but it <b>is</b> still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.Imperfect <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist {{in a constant state of}} performing that <b>duty.</b> This <b>is</b> what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect <b>duties</b> <b>are</b> those <b>duties</b> that <b>are</b> never truly completed. A particular example provided by Kant <b>is</b> the imperfect <b>duty</b> to cultivate one's own talents.|$|R

5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy <b>duty</b> <b>was</b> cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France.
