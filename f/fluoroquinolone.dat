5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a <b>fluoroquinolone</b> {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a <b>fluoroquinolone</b> is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral <b>fluoroquinolone</b> ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a <b>fluoroquinolone</b> due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fluoroquinolones</b> {{are known}} to be safe and well tolerated. They are said to have the widest {{clinical}} acceptability when compared with other antibiotics. Their reported side effects include gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system effect and blood disorder. Rare side effects include phototoxicity, hypersensitivity, convulsion, psychosis, tendinitis, hypoglycemia, cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Some of these side effects have led to the withdrawal of some <b>fluoroquinolones</b> like travofloxacin from clinical use in some countries. Of recent <b>fluoroquinolones</b> induce cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity has gain attention. Due to increasing reports on <b>fluoroquinolones</b> associated hepatotoxicity in experimental Animal studies and clinical experience. This study reviews reported hepatotoxicity associated with clinically used <b>fluoroquinolones</b> and their safety profile on liver function. It was observed that some <b>fluoroquinolones</b> may have hepatotoxic potential. Reported <b>fluoroquinolones</b> induce hepatotoxicity manifested as hepatitis, pancreatis, jaundice, liver injury and hepatic failure. Most reported cases of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> induced hepatotoxicity were marked by elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin and prolong prothrobin time. In some reported cases liver biopsy revealed hepatocellular damage, necrosis and degeneration. Mixed inflammatory infiltrates containing eosinophils, portal edema, bile ductular proliferation and lobular cholestasis were also observed in some cases. The mechanism of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> induce hepatotoxicity may involve generation of oxidative radicals in the liver during drug metabolism which induces DNA damage, mitochondrial damage and gene regulation leading to hepatocellular damage. This was observed in travofloxacin which enhances hepatic mitochondrial peroxynitrite stress in mice with underlying increased basal levels of super oxide leading to the disruption of critical mitochondrial enzyme and gene regulation. This mechanism could be associated with <b>fluoroquinolones</b> mechanism of action which includes DNA damage. In conclusion <b>fluoroquinolones</b> are well tolerated but some may have hepatotoxic potential. Most clinically used <b>fluoroquinolones</b> are relatively safe but Clinicians should consider patients liver function status before <b>fluoroquinolones</b> clinical recommendation.

40|$|<b>Fluoroquinolones</b> are {{synthetic}} antibacterial {{agents that}} stabilize the ternary complex of prokaryotic topoisomerase II enzymes (gyrase and Topo IV), leading to extensive DNA fragmentation and bacteria death. Despite the similar structural folds within the critical regions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic topoisomerases, clinically relevant <b>fluoroquinolones</b> display a remarkable selectivity for prokaryotic topoisomerase II, with excellent safety records in humans. Typical agents that target human topoisomerases (such as etoposide, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone) {{are associated with}} significant toxicities and secondary malignancies, whereas clinically relevant <b>fluoroquinolones</b> are not known to exhibit such propensities.

40|$|Background: <b>Fluoroquinolones</b> are {{a popular}} class of {{antibiotics}} used in variety of infections. However, toxicities {{are associated with}} these agents of which seizure provoking action of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> are compared in this study. Objective: To compare the proconvulsive profile of various generation of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> namely ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin and moxifloxacin in experimental models of convulsions in rat and to correlate {{the same with the}} clinical literature. Material and Methods: Proconvulsive activity of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> was assessed in rats. The animals were treated intraperitoneally with 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin and moxifloxacin. After 30 minutes, animals were subjected to maximal electroshock (MES) & pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced convulsions. Results: Proconvulsive property of ciprofloxacin was greater compared to other <b>fluoroquinolones</b> in both MES and PTZ method. Levofloxacin produced statistically significant proconvulsive action only in MES, and was insignificant in case of PTZ induced convulsions. Sparfloxacin and moxifloxacin had no significant proconvulsant activity in both the models.

This has raised concerns about development of mycobac-terial resistance. The current study evaluates the sale of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> (among other antibacterials) in Moshi, Tanzania, a country with one of the highest burdens of TB in the world. Methods: Trained pharmacy assistants registered the sale of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> during February and March 2009 to outpatients in Moshi in all 14 pharmacies that are authorized to sell antibacterials for systemic use. The sale of all antibacterials of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) J 01 class was expressed in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). The availability of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> in drug outlets that are not authorized to sell antibacterials for systemic use was assessed in 15 randomly selected outlets in Moshi. Results: The sale of antibacterials to outpatients in Moshi by authorized pharmacies was 4. 99 DID. The sale of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> was 0. 62 DID (12 % of total antibacterial sales). Ciprofloxacin was available in all 15 unauthor-ized drug outlets. Conclusions: The substantial sales of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> by authorized pharmacies and the wide availability of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> in unauthorized drug outlets in Moshi constitute a challenge to the use of <b>fluoroquinolones</b> in TB treatment in Tanzania.
