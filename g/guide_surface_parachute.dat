Cutting force will be greater, which is bound to exacerbate {{the wear and tear}} of the machine tool guides. Therefore, new requirements of numerical control machine tool <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> hardness are proposed. Using Laser surface heat treatment process to scan the <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> of CNC Machine Tool, the guide can get high hardness hardened layer. After being casted iron HT 300 was heat treated by the laser, the microstructure is homogeneous, very fine martensite. Its Surface hardness can get to HV 832.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{methodology for}} dynamic description of rigid multibody systems with translational clearance joints is presented and {{discussed in this}} work. Over the last years, extensive {{work has been done}} to study the dynamic effect of the revolute joints with clearance in multibody systems, in contrast with the little work devoted to model translational joints with clearance. In a joint with translation clearance there are many possible ways to set the physical configuration between the slider and guide, namely: (1) no contact between the two elements, (2) one corner of the slider in contact with the <b>guide</b> <b>surface,</b> (3) two adjacent slider corners in contact with the <b>guide</b> <b>surface,</b> (4) two opposite slider corners in contact with the <b>guide</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The conditions for switching from one case to another depend on the system dynamics configuration. The proposed methodology takes into account these four different situations. The existence of a clearance in a translational joint removes two kinematic constraints from a planar system and introduces two extra degrees of freedom in the system. Thus, a translational clearance joint does not constrain any degree of freedom of the mechanical system but it imposes some restrictions on the slider motion inside the guide limits. When the slider reaches the <b>guide</b> <b>surfaces</b> an impact occurs and the dynamic response of the joint is controlled by contact-impact forces. These forces are evaluated here with continuous contact force law together with a dissipative friction force model. The contact-impact forces are introduced into the system’s equations of motion as external generalized forces. The proposed methodology is applied to a planar multibody mechanical system with a translational clearance joint in order to demonstrate its features.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when yarns pass over <b>guides</b> or other <b>surfaces.</b> The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with doubled yarn in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> and blocked twist builds up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the <b>guide</b> <b>surface.</b> In the second mechanism blocking torque is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn <b>surface</b> and the <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of yarn to guide. The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a singles yarn (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces. The main circumstances under which these different mechanisms may operate, have been identified and suggestions made for minimising the blockage of twist...|$|R

The ultrasonic <b>guided</b> <b>surface</b> wave signals were continuously measured and post-processed by short time Fourier transform (STFT) to evaluate the frequency spectra along the time axis. Over the ultrasonic time window, the frequency spectra were very dispersed for the specimens with honeycombs. The results suggested that during the early hydration of concrete, the added water filled the honeycombs and led to incoherent surface wave that significantly dispersed the frequency spectra. It is because the size of the honeycomb is in the same order as the wavelength the scattered surface wave. With this method, the presence of honeycomb immediately after casting of concrete can be detected non-destructively.
