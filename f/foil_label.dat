40|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesives}} (PSA) {{present an}} interesting class {{of products that}} offers a potential to produce a novel generation of self-adhesives with a great number at excellent properties. The term pres-sure-sensitive describes adhesives that are aggressively and permanently tacky in the dry form at room temperature and firmly adhere {{to a variety of}} dissimilar surfaces upon mere contact, without the need of more than finger or hand pressure. Acrylic self-adhesive polymers are nowadays synthesized from a wide selection of acrylic ester monomers, often with low levels of monomers having pendant functional groups. The three basic types of acrylic common today are solvent-borne, water-borne, and solvent-free acrylic PSAs. They can be used in the production of single- and double-sided self-adhesive tapes, <b>foil</b> <b>labels,</b> carrier-free tapes, self-adhesive bioelectrodes, and decorative PVC signs and marking films. A pressure-sensitive adhesive requires a balance of cohesive strength and viscoelastic properties. These characteristics are based on three parameters: tack, adhesion, and cohesion...|$|R
40|$|Issue: The {{quality of}} clean PET regrind has {{steadily}} improved with advances in PET collection programs and intermediate processing. However, the quality requirements for most recycled PET applications are highly demanding. The acceptable level of particulate contaminants for many end-products {{is less than}} 100 parts per million (or 0. 01 % by weight). Particulate impurities can also plug or damage equipment during manufacturing. Today’s state-of-the-art separation technology still {{may not be able}} to remove these particulate contaminants from recycled PET to these extremely low levels. Melt filtration is one possible option for ensuring contaminant removal and a high quality product. Background: Particulate contaminants in recycled PET flake are small, non-melting materials that, in many cases, are incompatible with PET. The most common contaminants are aluminum from caps and <b>foil</b> <b>labels,</b> other metals, dirt, glass, and paper. These contaminants must be reduced below 100 parts per million to avoid the following major problems: 1) Inferior Properties: Particulate material can cause haze, visible defects, and reduced mechanical properties. 2) Plugged Orifices: Particles entrained in melted PET can plug small openings in convertin...|$|R

5000|$|Jaroslawski {{collaborated with}} Baccarat for the perfume bottles but also had {{commissioned}} Lalique {{to create the}} luxurious Art Nouveau glass medallions. Baccarat produced the classic Ybry perfume bottle, a flattened square in colored crystal. These beautiful bottles were made by overlaying colored crystal on white crystal to create an opaque and unique luminescent quality. Each different color, was related to a particular perfume, and to a different gem. The colors range from a red, slag green to a darker green, jet black, orange to butterscotch, deep purple to lavender. Most of the time, the bottles had matching enameled and gilded metal covers. These covers were placed over the inner stoppers at an angle on {{one corner of the}} bottle. The atomizers came equipped with either chrome or gilt brass hardware. The colored bottles had round gold <b>foil</b> embossed <b>labels,</b> the black bottles had square, silver <b>foil</b> embossed <b>labels.</b> This bottle received a patent granted on 1925.The bottles ranged in size from 7 7/8" [...] tall down to diminutive sample sizes of just 1 3/8" [...] tall. The presentation boxes were covered with fine leather and often had color-coordinated small triangular segments and luxurious silk tassels. Other boxes looked like little suitcases and were covered in suede, and held multiple presentations, such as three bottles and two atomizers. Another rare example held two bottles, one atomizer and a Lalique medallion attached to the case with a silk tassel.|$|R
5000|$|... 0. Tenth Anniversary Collection (release: May 3, 2004) This set was a foiled promotional {{collection}} of eighteen unique ships and commanders. It was labeled {{with a set}} number of 0, which is otherwise associated with reprints of various cards with alternate images, as <b>foils,</b> and/or <b>labeled</b> with the promotion {{in place of the}} cards' otherwise descriptive, but non-gameplay related lore. The cards themselves were numbered 6 through 23, as five promotional cards had already been printed, and continued the declaration that all foils printed in 2004 would carry the Tenth Anniversary logo. This set, however, does include the last of the cards with that icon, even though Reflections 2.0 also had foil cards in 2004. The collection itself was later reprinted without the Tenth Anniversary logo and numbered 54 through 71. The cards were originally given away with a recommended $3.00 purchase of other Star Trek CCG products, one pair at a time, over a period of nine weeks. The reprints were available for purchase on the Decipher website.|$|R
5000|$|Commercial corked wine bottles {{typically}} have a protective sleeve called a foil (commonly {{referred to as}} a [...] "capsule") covering the top of the bottle, the purpose of which is to protect the cork from being gnawed away by rodents or infested with the cork weevil and to serve as collar to catch small drips when pouring. The foil also serves as a decorative element of the bottle's <b>label.</b> <b>Foils</b> were historically made of lead; however, because of research showing that trace amounts of toxic lead could remain on the lip of the bottle and mix with the poured wine, lead foil bottleneck wrapping was slowly phased out, and by the 1990s, most foils were made of tin, heat-shrink plastic (polyethylene or PVC), or aluminium or polylaminate aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} {{producing}} aluminum foil for packaging in 1926. Reynolds Metals {{created the first}} high-speed, gravure-printed <b>foil,</b> aluminum bottle <b>labels,</b> heat-sealed <b>foil</b> bags for foods and foil-laminated building insulation paper. In 1940 Reynolds Metals began mining bauxite (aluminum ore) in Bauxite, Arkansas and opened its first aluminum plant near Sheffield, Alabama, the following year. In 1947, the company released Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil. Reynolds Metals pioneered the development of aluminum siding in 1945, and Richard S. Reynolds began predicting a growing demand for additional aluminum during peacetime. He believed new aluminum-producing facilities {{would need to be}} built to meet demand. Reynolds Metals Company leased, and later bought, six government defense plants that were up for disposal. Reynolds later expanded into non aluminum products such as plastics and precious metals, introducing Reynolds Plastic Wrap in 1982.|$|R

40|$|The term “bath salts” {{refers to}} an {{emerging}} family of drugs containing one or more synthetic chemicals related to cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant found naturally in the Khat plant. Reports of severe intoxication and dangerous health effects associated with use of bath salts have made these drugs a serious and growing {{public health and safety}} issue. The synthetic cathinones in bath salts can produce euphoria and increased sociability and sex drive, but some users experience paranoia, agitation, and hallucinatory delirium; some even display psychotic and violent behavior, and deaths have been reported in several instances. In Name Only The synthetic cathinone products marketed as “bath salts” to evade detection by authorities {{should not be confused with}} products such as Epsom salts that are sold to improve the experience of bathing. The latter have no psychoactive (drug-like) properties. Bath salts typically take the form of a white or brown crystalline powder and are sold in small plastic or <b>foil</b> packages <b>labeled</b> “not for human consumption. ” Sometimes also marketed as “plant food”—or, more recently, as “jewelry cleaner” or “phone screen cleaner”—they are sold online and in drug paraphernalia stores under a variety of brand names, such as “Ivory Wave," "Bloom," "Cloud Nine," "Lunar Wave," "Vanilla Sky," "White Lightning," and “Scarface. ” How Are Bath Salts Abused? Bath salts are typically taken orally, inhaled, or injected, with the worst outcomes being associated with snorting or needle injection. How Do Bath Salts Affect the Brain? Common synthetic cathinones found in bath salts include 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), mephedrone (“Drone,” “Meph,” or “Meow Meow”), and methylone, but there are many others. Much is still unknown about how these substances affect the human brain, and each one may have somewhat different properties. Chemically, they are similar to amphetamines (such as methamphetamine) as well as to MDMA (ecstasy). The energizing and often agitating effects reported in people who have taken bath salts are consistent with other drugs like amphetamines and cocaine that raise the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine in brain circuits regulating reward and movement. A surge in dopamine in these circuits causes feelings of euphoria and increased activity. A similar surge of the transmitter norepinephrine can raise heart rate and blood pressure. Bath salts have been marketed as cheap (and until recently, legal—see Box) substitutes for those stimulants. A recent study found that MDPV—the most common synthetic cathinone found in the blood and urine of patients admitted to emergency departments after bath salts ingestion—raises brain dopamine in the same manner as cocaine but is at least 10 times more potent. The hallucinatory effects often reported in users of bath salts are consistent with other drugs such as MDMA or LSD that raise levels of another neurotransmitter, serotonin. A recent analysis of the effects in rats of mephedrone and methylone showed that these drugs raised levels of serotonin in a manner similar to MDMA. An Evolving Threat When bath salts emerged at the end of the last decade, they rapidly gained popularity in the U. S. and Europe as “legal highs. ” In October 2011, the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration placed three common synthetic cathinones under emergency ban pending further investigation, and in July 2012, President Obama signed legislation permanently making two of them—mephedrone and MDPV—illegal along with several other synthetic drugs often sold as marijuana substitutes (“Spice”). Although the new law also prohibits chemically similar “analogues” of the named drugs, manufacturers are expected to respond by creating new drugs different enough from the banned substances to evade legal restriction. After mephedrone was banned in the United Kingdom in 2010, for example, a chemical called naphyrone quickly replaced it, and is now being sold as “jewelry cleaner” under the brand name “Cosmic Blast. ” What Are the Other Health Effects of Bath Salts? Bath salts have been linked to an alarming surge in visits to emergency departments and poison control centers across the country. Common reactions reported for people who have needed medical attention after using bath salts include cardiac symptoms (such as racing heart, high blood pressure, and chest pains) and psychiatric symptoms including paranoia, hallucinations, and panic attacks. Patients with the syndrome known as “excited delirium” from taking bath salts also may have dehydration, breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, and kidney failure. Intoxication from several synthetic cathinones including MDPV, mephedrone, methedrone, and butylone has proved fatal in several instances. Early indications are that synthetic cathinones have a high abuse and addiction potential. In a study of the rewarding and reinforcing effects of MDPV, rats showed self-administration patterns and escalation of drug intake nearly identical to methamphetamine. Bath salts users have reported that the drugs trigger intense cravings (or a compulsive urge to use the drug again) and that they are highly addictive. Frequent consumption may induce tolerance, dependence, and strong withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. The dangers of bath salts are compounded by the fact that these products may contain other, unknown ingredients that may have their own harmful effects. Also, drug users who believe they are purchasing other drugs such as ecstasy may be in danger of receiving synthetic cathinones instead. For example, mephedrone has been found commonly substituted for MDMA in pills sold as ecstasy in the Netherlands...|$|R
