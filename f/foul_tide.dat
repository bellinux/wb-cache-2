60|$|So {{it seems}} at the moment, but I {{am not sure}} that it is so true as it is that after passing the Tower the one shore of the Thames begins to lose its dignity and beauty, and to be of like effect with the other, which is the Southwark side, and like all the American river-sides that I remember. Grimy {{business}} piles, sagging sheds, and frowsy wharves and docks grieve the eye, which the shipping in the stream does little to console. That is mostly of dingy tramp-steamers, or inferior Dutch liners, clumsy barges, and here and there a stately brig or shapely schooner; but it gathers nowhere into the forest of masts and chimneys that fringe the North River and East River. The <b>foul</b> <b>tide</b> rises and falls between low shores where, when it ebbs, are seen oozy shoals of slime, and every keel or paddle that stirs the surface of the river brings up the loathsomeness of the bottom.|$|E
60|$|It {{is equally}} {{a fact that}} these vices were {{imported}} into England by the young men who, under pretence of learning the Italian polish, travelled to Italy. From the days of Gabriel Harvey and Lord Oxford, about the middle of Elizabeth's reign, this <b>foul</b> <b>tide</b> had begun to set toward England, gaining an additional coarseness and frivolity in passing through the French Court (then an utter Gehenna) in its course hitherward; till, to judge by Marston's 'Satires,' certain members of the higher classes had, {{by the beginning of}} James's reign, learnt nearly all which the Italians had to teach them. Marston writes in a rage, it is true; foaming, stamping, and vapouring too much to escape the suspicion of exaggeration; yet he dared not have published the things which he does, had he not fair ground for some at least of his assertions. And Marston, be it remembered, was no Puritan, but a playwright, and Ben Jonson's friend.|$|E

30|$|Green tides {{formed by}} some green algae {{excessive}} {{growth has been}} reported in {{in many parts of the}} world, including Europe, America, Australia, and Asia (Taylor et al. 2001; Nelson et al. 2003, 2008; Sun et al. 2008; Yabe et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2012). In nutrient-rich habitats green algae grow rapidly and often cause marine <b>fouling.</b> Green <b>tides</b> have been the focus of many studies due to their detrimental effects on coastal ecology. Photosynthetic activities and capacities, proliferation, and nutrient absorption usually contribute to rapid biomass accumulation (Kim et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2010).|$|R
6000|$|It {{was very}} triumphant, and I think at its hopefulest, in 1750, soon after starting,--when Excellency Hanbury first {{appeared}} at Berlin {{on behalf of}} it. That was Excellency Hanbury's first journey on this errand; {{and he made a}} great many more, no man readier; a stirring, intriguing creature (and always with such moneys to distribute); had victorious hopes now and then,--which one and all proved fatuous. ["June, 1750," [...] Hanbury for Berlin (Britannic Majesty much anxious Hanbury were there): Hanbury to Warsaw next (hiring Polish Majesty there); at Dresden, does make victorious Treaty, September, 1751; at Vienna, 1753 (still on the aawe quest). Coxe's--Pelham,--ii. 339, 196, 469.] In 1751 and 1752, the darling Project met cross <b>tides,</b> <b>foul</b> winds, political whirlpools ("Such a set are those German Princes!")--and swam, indomitable, though near desperate, as Project seldom did; till happily, in 1753, it sank drowned:--and left his Grace of Newcastle asking, [...] "Well-a-day! And is not England drowned too?" [...] We hope not.|$|R
60|$|They {{cast anchor}} off Flushing, for {{the wind was}} now <b>foul,</b> but when <b>tide</b> turned they again got under way and beat up the channel to Axel. No {{questions}} were asked as they drew up alongside the wharves. Ned at once stepped ashore {{and made his way}} to a small inn, chiefly frequented by sailors, near the jetty. The shades of night were just falling as they arrived, and he thought it were better not to attempt to proceed further until the following morning. He had been several times at Axel in the Good Venture, and was familiar with the town. The population was a mixed one, for although situated in Brabant, Axel had so much communication with the opposite shores of Holland that a considerable portion of the population had imbibed something of the spirit that animated their neighbours, and would, if opportunity offered, have gladly thrown off the authority of the officials appointed by the Spaniards.|$|R
