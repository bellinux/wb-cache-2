[...] As the value of paper money dropped, Stevens railed against gold speculators, and in June 1864 after consultation with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposed {{what became known as}} the Gold Bill—to abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery. It passed Congress in June; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster. [...] Under heavy pressure from the business community, Congress repealed the bill on July 1, twelve days after its passage. Stevens was unrepentant even as the value of paper currency recovered in late 1864 amid the expectation of Union victory, proposing legislation to make paying a premium in greenbacks for an amount in gold coin a criminal offense.

50|$|The {{return on}} {{domestically}} held short-dated government bonds is normally {{perceived as a}} good proxy for the risk free rate. In Business valuation the long-term yield on the US Treasury coupon bonds is generally accepted as the risk free rate of return. However, theoretically this is only correct {{if there is no}} perceived risk of default associated with the bond. Government bonds are conventionally considered to be relatively risk-free to a domestic holder of a government bond, because there is by definition no risk of default - the bond is a form of <b>government</b> <b>obligation</b> which is being discharged through the payment of another form of <b>government</b> <b>obligation</b> (i.e. the domestic currency). Of course, default on government debt does happen, so if in theory this is impossible, then this points out a deficiency of the theory. Another issue with this approach is that with coupon-bearing bonds, the investor does not know ex-ante what his return will be on the reinvested coupons (and hence the return cannot really be considered risk free).|$|R
