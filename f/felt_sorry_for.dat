5|$|On Jan 12, 2017, {{actor and}} {{producer}} Deepak Raj Giri {{informed that the}} movie was leaked in Facebook. Later on Jan 13, 2017, a person committed suicide after he was alleged with the piracy but the police found no connection of him to the piracy. Actor Deepak Raj Giri posted in his Facebook account that he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the boy who committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After the Lord's Test, Miller {{enjoyed a}} night out and {{returned}} to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning. Australia were due to play Surrey at The Oval that day. With Australia in the field, Bradman sent Miller to the fine leg boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced to walk the length of the field. One of the spectators <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Miller and lent him his bicycle, which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her, put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E

5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the making of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive. Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously on the plate when served. When asked in DVD commentary if he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of Syrmia, people {{believed}} that dragons lived on high mountains and flew {{high in the sky}} shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense and terrible clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak ("cloud"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time waving his arms, or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When the wind blew the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that he did his best, but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Welsh of the South Wales Echo {{gave the}} {{stalking}} storyline a negative review.

500|$|Despite being {{presented}} as a [...] "polished commercial group" [...] in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US {{did not make a}} good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as [...] "a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run." [...] They were also criticised for being too American and the [...] "poor man's Vanilla Fudge".

60|$|I {{never see}} Tom look so little {{and like a}} fly; but that was because the giant's head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not dreadful any more, because {{you could see it}} was a noble face, and kind of sad, and not {{thinking}} about you, but about other things and larger. It was stone, reddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that give it an abused look, and you <b>felt</b> <b>sorrier</b> <b>for</b> it for that.|$|R

500|$|A {{few weeks}} before Libby was written out of the show, Watros and Michelle Rodriguez were arrested for driving under the {{influence}} in Kailua, Hawaii, in two separate incidents. This led fans to speculate that this was the cause of the two characters' deaths in the episode [...] "Two for the Road". The producers denied this claim, and Rodriguez confirmed the producers' comments and denied the relation between their arrests and their characters' deaths. Watros took the news of the death of her character badly and was sad about the decision. The producers <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her and tried to help her get a new job. She was cast in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Hilary Busis {{wished the}} episode [...] "had {{done more to}} move the show's master plot forward, {{especially}} since watching it meant missing the first hour of the Golden Globes." [...] Busis also wished that Caulfield had received more screen time, calling her performance [...] "superbly creepy." [...] IGN columnist Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 6.5/10, explaining that the tone was [...] "over-the-top" [...] and Emma's actions to hide the children, rather than report them, [...] "out of character." [...] Ratcliffe added on a more positive note that the Hansel and Gretel storyline was a [...] "safe choice, but they made it work." [...] Cassandra Scrimgeour of The Huffington Post found [...] "Parrilla's emotional reaction to the children's rejection [...] so effective that despite her evil ways, I actually <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her." [...] Scrimgeour concluded that [...] "the most intriguing thing to happen" [...] in the episode was {{the arrival of the}} Stranger.|$|E

500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Steiger starred as {{a detective}} {{assigned}} {{to investigate the}} murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes's The Naked Face. Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a [...] "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [...] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be [...] "acting in his high hysteria gear", who [...] "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series The Glory Boys (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and Hollywood Wives (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins [...] "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" [...] that he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 album Dog Eat Dog, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song [...] "Tax Free".|$|E

500|$|Chatham's Post, a {{position}} {{named after a}} Light Horse officer, was Sing's first sniping post. Biographer Brian Tate wrote, [...] "It was here that Billy Sing began in earnest his lethal occupation." [...] He set about his task with a Lee–Enfield [...]303 rifle. An account by Private Frank Reed, a fellow Australian soldier, states that Sing {{was so close to}} the Turkish lines that enemy artillery rarely troubled him. His comrades left three particular enemy positions to his attention: a trench at 350 yards (320 m) from his post, a communication sap at 500 yards (457 m), and a track in a gully at 1,000 yards (914 m). According to Reed, [...] "Every time Billy Sing <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the poor Turks, he remembered how their snipers picked off the Australian officers {{in the early days of}} the landing, and he hardened his heart. But he never fired at a stretcher-bearer or any of the soldiers who were trying to rescue wounded Turks." [...] In contrast, Hamilton said in a 2008 interview, [...] "We have an anecdote where, after spotting an injured Turk, he said 'I'll put that poor cuss out of his agony' and just shot him. He was a very tough man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{devised a}} romance storyline {{for the character}} alongside Mike Young (Guy Pearce). Jane's grandmother is {{not happy with the}} prospect of Jane and Mike forming a relationship. Jane decides not to pursue their relationship any further. Pearce told Patrice Fidgeon from TV Week that his character mainly shared a [...] "platonic" [...] relationship with Jane. But writers introduced a temporary love interest for Jane, pilot Glen Matheson (Richard Moss) who is much older than her. Nell disapproves of her new boyfriend because of the age difference. But Jane decides to end the romance, Pearce explained that [...] "she realises this was not going to work out and calls it quits." [...] This wins Nell's support of Jane's involvement with Mike who is of a similar age. The pair had not been on good terms prior to working together on a photography assignment. They spend the day with Charlene and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) but after they leave the pair spend time alone and resolve their past problems. Pearce added that his character had been trying to charm Jane for some time. Eventually [...] "she gives in" [...] to Mike, Pearce believed that she <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Mike but over time comes to the realisation that she [...] "really likes him".|$|E
500|$|Riley was [...] "furious" [...] when he {{discovered}} Mercedes' escorting, and told her {{he did not want}} her around their son Bobby. Regarding Mercedes' maternal feelings for Bobby, she stated, [...] "Mercedes feels that when she's getting closer to Riley, she can bond a bit more with Bobby as well. But when Riley forgets her, she finds it a lot more difficult to cope with Bobby". Mercedes explained that she did not sleep with Doctor Browning for money this time, which calmed Riley down. Metcalfe said that Mercedes was [...] "very honest and open" [...] with Riley and that they were [...] "very natural together". The actress said Riley had begun to [...] "see that she's really damaged and has been affected by what's happened a lot more than she's letting on". Metcalfe added that Riley <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Mercedes after seeing the [...] "vulnerable Mercedes, the one who doesn't hurt people". Metcalfe said that Mercedes wanted Riley back, but if she could not, she wanted to prevent anyone else from getting the life Mercedes would have had if she had married Riley. She added that although Mercedes wanted Riley back she loved Malachy more, and believed that Malachy was the love of Mercedes' life.|$|E
