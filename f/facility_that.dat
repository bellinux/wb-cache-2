40|$|<b>Facilities</b> <b>that</b> self-police {{under the}} Environmental Protection AgencyÕs Audit Policy are {{eligible}} for reduced penalties on disclosed violations. This paper investigates whether self- policing has additional consequences, in particular whether self-policing reduces future enforcement activity. Using data on U. S. hazardous waste enforcement and disclosures, I find <b>that</b> <b>facilities</b> <b>that</b> self-police are rewarded with a lower probability of inspection in the future, although facilities with good compliance records may receive a smaller benefit than facilities with poor records. Additionally, <b>facilities</b> <b>that</b> are inspected frequently {{are more likely to}} disclose than <b>facilities</b> <b>that</b> face a low probability of inspection. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>facilities</b> may be able to strategically disclose in order to decrease future enforcement.

5|$|O'Brien {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} town of Wellington, 360 {{kilometres}} (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style <b>facility</b> <b>that</b> had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.|$|E
5|$|Previously, SR125 had {{a direct}} {{connection}} with SR905 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. With {{the completion of the}} freeway segment of SR905 and the freeway-to-freeway connection to SR 125 unconstructed, traffic on SR 125 must head west on Otay Mesa Road and south on La Media Road to make the connection. A freeway-to-freeway interchange is planned for the connection between SR125 and SR905, and construction began in late 2015; there are also plans to connect to the new SR 11 freeway once it is constructed. SR11 is planned to be a toll <b>facility</b> <b>that</b> will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 11 westbound and eastbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at a cost of over $21 million.|$|E
