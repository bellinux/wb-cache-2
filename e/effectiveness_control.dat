40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Airside Value Model. In the field of airport operations and airport performance measurement, there is much focus on ‘economical performance’. Additionally, Key Performance Indicators to assess airside operations are used, but these sets of KPIs are very diverse and the reasons for measuring them are not always clear. Moreover, these KPIs are not used to actually drive the operations at the airport’s airside. The Airside Value Model seeks to expand this limited domain by allowing airport managers to assess the Value created in their airside operations and use this information to optimize them. This Value measurement goes beyond just economical considerations, but also includes operational performance, environmental aspects et cetera. It has been shown that the Airside Value Model is able to measure these different aspects of Value and link them to operational processes. However, more work is required to enhance its <b>effectiveness.</b> <b>Control</b> & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal control framework {{to determine a}} collection of open-loop command signals that mathematically guarantees operation of an aircraft within certain prescribed state constraints. The framework is specifically applied to estimate margins for the reference command inputs of aircraft autopilot systems, so that safe operation within a given flight envelope can be assured under appropriate control action. Flight envelope excursions are generally considered as precursors to Loss-Of-Control incidents, and hence, these margins contain safety critical information that can help improve the situational awareness on-board the aircraft. In off-nominal conditions, the computed safety margins provide indications of a degraded aircraft with reduced flying and handling qualities. These indications appear {{in the form of}} increasingly more strict limits on the autopilot reference command input. The entire framework is illustrated on an example problem involving a pitch dynamics model with state constraints on the pitch attitude. Simulations are conducted wherein margins are computed for the reference pitch command of the pitch hold system, while the aircraft enters an off-nominal condition with severely degraded system dynamics and reduced elevator <b>effectiveness.</b> <b>Control</b> & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

The nematicide (aldicarb, carbofuran, oxamyl, and miral) performance and yield response varied with dosage sequences. Applications of 2, 3, and 2 g ai/tree in March, July, and October (sequence I), respectively, gave greater control of M. javanica than did applications of 3, 2, and 2 g ai/tree in March, June, and September (sequence II), respectively. However, the high initial dose sequence was effective against H. multicinctus. Persistence of the different nematicides differed over the 14 -month experimental period. Miral, aldicarb, and carbofuran were the most effective treatments against either species {{by the end of}} the wet and dry seasons.

The conclusion {{is that there is a}} substantially longer planning lead time in the ship refurbishment sector than in construction. The state of completion of design before refurbishment work commences is higher in the shipping industry. Site managers from the ship refurbishment sector are brought into the planning and control processes earlier than their counterparts from the construction industry. In both industries, however, schedules and bar charts are the most frequently used formal planning techniques, in comparison with computer based techniques such as PERT, GERT and expert systems; the main reasons being familiarity, the relatively low levels of skill and knowledge needed to understand them as much as their perceived flexibility and relative cheapness for their production and updating.

40|$|Biological {{explanations}} of depression {{have been found}} to increase professional perceptions of the effectiveness of medical treatments and reduce the perceptions of the effectiveness of psychological therapy. Studies in lay populations have shown that biological explanations reduce perceptions of self-efficacy and control over depression symptoms. There is a lack of research examining the impact of causal models on clinicians’ attitudes. The current study aimed to explore whether clinicians’ causal models of a client’s depression can be biased by aetiological labelling and, in turn, whether clinicians’ causal models impact clinical judgements and attitudes. An experimental design was utilised, with one independent variable (labelling of the client’s depression) with three levels (biological, psychosocial and neutral). Outcomes measured causal beliefs, treatment <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>control,</b> clinical attitudes and perceived stigma in relation to a client vignette. Observational data were analysed to explore the effects of clinicians’ primary causal models on the outcome variables. Over 200 trainee clinical psychologists, across England, Scotland and Wales, took part in an online survey, presented using surveymonkey®. Where appropriate data were analysed using ANOVA. There was a small effect of the manipulation; labelling the depression as biological increased biological causal attributions and increased perceptions of the effectiveness of medical treatments. The exploratory analysis demonstrated substantial effects of strongly endorsing biological causal beliefs on judgements of medical treatments and client engagement. The results suggest that clinicians’ causal models of a client’s depression may bias clinical judgements. These findings are preliminary and further research is needed...|$|E

Regression of economic growth on these indices produces conventional results (positive effect of stricter {{protection of}} IPR on growth) only if indices of institutional capacity (government <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>control</b> over corruption) are not included into the right hand side. If they are included, they kill the effect of IPR protection (because they are very much correlated with the IPR protection indices), so it is hardly possible to separate the effects of stricter IPR protection from the impact of the general strength of institutions. The same procedure was used to evaluate the impact of the IPR protection regime on the average share of R&D expenditure in GDP and the results were largely the same: without control for the institutional capacity, IPR protection seems to stimulate R&D, but after controlling for the institutional indices the effect disappears. There is also a strong negative effect of stricter regime of protection of IPR on the proliferation of the most crucial technology of recent decades – computers. The increase in the total number of PCs in 1995 - 2005, after controlling for the level of development, the size of the country and the institutional index, is negatively correlated with the IPR protection index. If piracy of intellectual products allows to overcome the negative impact of IPR protection on the dissemination of new technologies, it is reasonable to talk not about costs of piracy, but about the benefits of piracy and the costs of stricter IPR protection. ...|$|E

However, As the dynamic behavior and response characteristics of a practical MSCS with active control is different from the MSCS which is only installed additional dampers, it is necessary to further investigate its control mechanism and control effectiveness. In this paper, a new control method is proposed which employ active control and passive dampers together to form a huge control system based on the particular conformation characteristic of MSCS. Active control, for mega-sub controlled structure subjected to seismic loads is investigated based on LQR algorithm. Dynamic equation and method to assembling parameter matrixes for the meg-sub controlled structure under seismic ground motions are presented. Moreover, the additional damping ratio, the weight matrixes are defined and a study of the two parameters that influences the response control <b>effectiveness,</b> <b>control</b> force and dynamic characteristic of the MSCS is discussed; the regulative relationship between additional damping ratio and active control parameter is also analyzed. The result indicates that the new structure employing active control can further reduce the responses of this building. With control parameter changes, the effectiveness that influences the dynamic responses of mega-frame and substructure by additional damping value is different. Therefore, when active control is adopted on MSCS, it’s necessary to adjust the damping value according {{to the size of the}} matrix to obtain the optimal control performance and active control force synthetically. This lay a foundation for further studying seismic performance and design of steel mega frame structures.
