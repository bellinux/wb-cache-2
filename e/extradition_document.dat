5000|$|O'Brien {{claims that}} when he was {{thirteen}} years old (...) , he hacked into NASA under the pseudonym [...] "Scorpion". IrishCentral and Irish Daily Mail said the incident was unconfirmed. In an interview with Silicon Republic, an Irish technology news website, O'Brien claimed that the NSA, through Interpol, appeared at his home following the hack. He told the agents he would help show them vulnerabilities in their network in exchange for not getting into trouble. According to O'Brien, he had an <b>extradition</b> <b>document</b> ready in his backpack, but he could not provide more details on the deal that was made due to non-disclosure agreements. French tabloid Telestar said there is no trace of the NASA hack. Techdirt pointed out that the United States Department of Homeland Security, claimed to have surrounded O'Brien's home, did not exist {{at the time of the}} alleged hack.|$|E
5000|$|US <b>extradition</b> <b>documents</b> {{state that}} [...] "at all times {{material}} to the indictment" [...] Babar Ahmad was resident in London. The Crown Prosecution Service declared in July 2004 and December 2006, as did the UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith in September 2006, that there was [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] to charge Ahmad with any criminal offence under UK law.|$|R
5000|$|Sirisak Tiypan, {{director}} general for international {{affairs of the}} Office of the Attorney General, said: [...] "No matter China or the Philippines, we have an extradition treaty with both countries." [...] Thaksin may appeal the guilty verdict until November 22 but prosecutors are working on <b>extradition</b> <b>documents.</b> Sirisak added [...] "that even if Thaksin decides {{to live in a}} country with which Thailand has no extradition treaty, authorities could ask for him to be handed over on a reciprocal basis." [...] Bahamas, Bermuda and African countries without extradition treaties with Thailand have reportedly offered to take in Thaksin and his wife.|$|R
5000|$|Registe's lawyer {{requested}} on November 20, 2008 {{that the}} judges of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba postpone the extradition hearing {{because he had}} not had sufficient time to study the <b>extradition</b> <b>documents</b> filed by the United States’ judicial authorities to discuss them with his client. Registe's lawyer requested that his client remain in St. Maarten due to doubts about Registe's likelihood of getting a fair trial in the United States:"My client has {{been the victim of}} frenzy in the United States. The media have described the alleged facts as an ‘execution-style murder’ and my client has been mentioned in one breath with serial killers and with Osama bin Laden. If my client would have to stand trial under such circumstances before a jury in a predominantly white state, then I have my serious doubts about the outcome." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1987 case, Puerto Rico v. Branstad, the Court {{overruled}} Dennison, {{and held}} that {{the governor of the}} asylum state has no discretion in performing his or her duty to extradite, whether that duty arises under the Extradition Clause of the Constitution or under the Extradition Act (...) , and that a federal court may enforce the governor's duty to return the fugitive to the demanding state. There are only four grounds upon which the Governor of the asylum state may deny another state’s request for extradition: (1) the <b>extradition</b> <b>documents</b> facially are not in order; (2) the person has not been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (3) the person is not the person named in the extradition documents; or (4) the person is not a fugitive. There appears to be at least one additional exception: if the fugitive is under sentence in the asylum state, he need not be extradited until his punishment in the asylum state is completed.|$|R
