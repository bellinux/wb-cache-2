5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

The Italian Chicken Sandwich is a chicken parmigiana sandwich with marinara sauce and mozzarella, the French Chicken Sandwich is a Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich with ham and Swiss cheese, and the American Chicken Sandwich has mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and American cheese.

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|Some insects {{present in}} the grapes at harvest inevitably {{end up in the}} press {{and for the most part}} are inoffensive. Others, notably types of ladybirds, or the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, release {{unpleasant}} volatile compounds as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's bouquet and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are methoxypyrazines, or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> pepper, or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

25|$|Cabernet Franc shares many of {{the same}} {{phenolic}} and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.|$|E
25|$|Uyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is polu (or pilaf), a dish found {{throughout}} Central Asia.

Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. Kawaplar (Uyghur: Каваплар) or chuanr (i.e., kebabs or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is leghmen (لەغمەن, ләғмән), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (säy, from Chinese cai, 菜) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> peppers, chili peppers, and cabbage.

500|$|Depending on the climate, {{the flavor}} {{can range from}} aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a {{tendency}} to produce wines with noticeable acidity and [...] "green flavors" [...] of grass, <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.|$|E
500|$|There are {{a couple}} of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The most widely {{recognized}} is the herbaceous or <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> pepper flavor caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in underripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are [...] present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as [...] 2 nanograms (ng) per liter. At the time of veraison, when the grapes first start to fully ripen, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30ng/l. In cooler climates, it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected. The <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> pepper flavor is not considered a wine fault {{but it may not be}} desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor, earning the nickname of [...] "Monterey veggies". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness.|$|E
500|$|The classic {{profile of}} Cabernet Sauvignon {{tends to be}} {{full-bodied}} wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity {{that contributes to the}} wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes while in very hot climates the currant flavors can veer towards the over-ripe and [...] "jammy" [...] side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have a characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.|$|E
