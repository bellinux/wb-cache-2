25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the <b>filtration</b> <b>media</b> and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the <b>filtration</b> <b>media</b> (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{different}} {{processes such as}} flocculation with {{ferric chloride}} (FeCl 3) and deep bed filtration (sand <b>filtration</b> and dual <b>media</b> <b>filtration)</b> as a pre-treatment were used for seawater desalination. The performance of these pre-treatments was determined in terms of silt density index (SDI) and modified fouling index by using microfilter (MF-MFI), ultrafilter (UF-MFI), and nanofilter (NF-MFI) membrane. MFI and SDI indicated that deep bed filtration with in-line flocculation was better pre-treatment than flocculation alone as colloidal particles are removed after this pretreatment. UF-MFI and NF-MFI indicated that these pretreatment cannot remove dissolved organic matter as the fouling reduction was smaller. Detailed molecular weight distribution (MWD) of seawater organic matter was examined after different pretreatments. MWD of the initial seawater mainly ranged from 1510 Da to 130 Da. Deep bed filtration with in-line flocculation removed relatively large molecular weight of organic matter (1510 - 1180 Da), while the small molecular weights (less than 530 Da) were not removed...|$|R

50|$|Filters come in many types. Many use pre-made <b>filtration</b> <b>media</b> such as sheets or candles. Kieselguhr, a fine powder of diatomaceous earth, can be {{introduced}} into the beer and circulated through screens to form a filtration bed. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filters remove yeasts and other solids, leaving some cloudiness, while finer filters can remove body and color. Sterile filters remove almost all microorganisms.|$|E
50|$|These filters use sheets {{that allow}} only {{particles}} {{smaller than a}} given size to pass through.

40|$|A {{series of}} pilot-scale {{granular}} <b>media</b> <b>filtration</b> experiments {{was conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} media roughness on filter performance and to evaluate the applicability of spherical, rough engineered ceramic filter media for use in granular media filters used for drinking water treatment. Filter media performance was assessed using turbidity and particle count reductions, Cryptosporidium oocyst and oocyst-sized microsphere removal, head loss and stability of operation. Experiments were designed to allow related facets of current filtration research to be examined. These included: effect of loading rate, coagulant type and dosage, and suitability of latex microspheres as surrogates for Cryptosporidium oocyst removal by granular <b>media</b> <b>filtration.</b> This study indicated that increased filter media roughness consistently improved turbidity and particle count reduction under the conditions investigated. As well, the engineered media also consistently achieved greater stability of operation during non-ideal operational periods (e. g. sudden change in filter influent turbidity). Oocyst removals were generally improved by media roughness, though this improvement was reliant on operating conditions, such as coagulant dose and type of coagulant used. The surrogate relationship between oocyst-sized latex microspheres and oocyst removal by filtration was also dependent on coagulant dose and type of coagulant. During trials with no coagulant addition, contrasts in oocyst removal were not significant, suggesting that neither surface roughness nor the size of media used were significant factors impacting oocyst removal by filtration during those periods of impaired operation. When pre-treating raw water with PACl, the engineered ceramic media achieved up to 1. 25 log 10 higher oocyst removals than conventional media. This improvement in oocyst removal relative to conventional media was not observed when alum was used as the primary coagulant, however. Future studies should directly compare engineered and conventional <b>media</b> <b>filtration</b> performance, using other raw water sources and different operating conditions. Biologically active filtration should also be included in future performance studies because the rough, highly porous surface of the engineered ceramic media is likely to provide excellent biofilm support...|$|R

50|$|Vermifilters can be {{used for}} primary, {{secondary}} and tertiary treatment of blackwater and greywater. On-site systems can treat influent from flush toilets (vermifilter toilets), where the treated effluent is disposed of to either surface or subsurface leach fields. Solid material (such as fecal matter and toilet paper) is retained, de-watered and digested by bacteria and earthworms and converted into humus in the primary process. The liquid fraction passes through <b>filtration</b> <b>media</b> on which microorganisms are attached, where secondary treatment occurs, mostly by retention of organic compounds that undergo biodegradation, but also because oxygen is dissolved into the water allowing further degradation to take place.|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} iron and manganese, along with large {{quantities}} of dissolved gases in the wells created concern for the viability of a conventional desalination design for the proposed City of Camarillo groundwater desalination facility. To identify viable pre-treatment process(es) for the control of metal oxide fouling in reverse osmosis, a 12 -month pilot study was undertaken. The pilot study tested several pre-treatment alternatives, {{one of which was}} chlorine dioxide and <b>filtration</b> using dual <b>media</b> filters to remove both iron and manganese oxides. The results of the pilot-scale testing indicated that chlorine dioxide and <b>filtration</b> using dual <b>media</b> filters is an effective pre-treatment process for preventing metal oxide fouling in reverse osmosis. Nearly 100 % {{of iron and}} approximately 70 % of manganese in the well water was oxidized and removed during the pre-treatment stages, and the remaining 30 % of manganese did not appear to cause fouling of the reverse osmosis membranes. Chlorine resistant membranes were also tested along with standard brackish water membranes, during the pilot study. The test results indicated that standard brackish water membranes experienced damage from either the chlorine dioxide or low levels of impurities within the chlorine dioxide. No damage was seen, however, for the chlorine resistant membranes...|$|R
