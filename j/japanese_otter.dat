50|$|Like most otters, the Japanese {{river otter}} {{was not an}} {{especially}} picky eater. While it primarily fed on fish, crab, and shrimp; it also ate eels, beetles, watermelons, and sweet potatoes. Many of these Japanese otters eat about 15% to 25% of their own body weight. Many otters spend around six hours to find food because of their difficult living space and their competition for food. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> was {{known as one of}} the top carnivores in the aquatic food chain.|$|E
50|$|Fully grown, a <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> {{was between}} 65 and 80 cm long, with a tail {{measuring}} 45 to 50 cm. It had a thick, lush coat of dark brown fur with short webbed feet. In addition the river otter has two types/sets of fur. Data {{has shown that}} the river otter would shed their under fur fully from May to August. After the shedding of the under fur, the otter shed their guard hair from August to November. This allowed them to adjust to the seasons changing. The otter had a lifespan of up to 25 years.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> lived {{throughout}} {{four main}} Japanese islands, {{but it has}} not been observed in the wild since 1979 and was declared extinct in 2012. Although recent taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that it should be treated as an independent species, International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List considers it as subspecies of Lutra lutra. Therefore, the taxonomic status of this species needs to be resolved. Here we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of two Japanese otters caught in Kanagawa and Kochi prefectures and five Eurasian otters (L. lutra). We reconstructed a molecular phylogenetic tree to estimate the phylogenetic position of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> in Lutrinae using the Japanese otters and the other 11 Lutrinae species on the basis of ND 5 (692 bp) and cytochrome b (1, 140 bp) sequences. We observed that the two Japanese otters had close relationships with Eurasian otters, forming a monophyletic group (100 % bootstrap probability). To elucidate detailed phylogenetic relationships among the Japanese and Eurasian otters, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood tree according to mitochondrial genome sequences (14, 740 bp). The <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> (JO 1) collected in Kanagawa was deeply nested in the Eurasian otter clade, whereas the <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> (JO 2) collected in Kochi formed a distinct independent lineage in the Lutra clade. The estimated molecular divergences time for the ancestral lineages of the Japanese otters was 0. 10 Ma (95 %: 0. 06 - 0. 16 Ma) and 1. 27 Ma (95 %: 0. 98 - 1. 59 Ma) for JO 1 and JO 2 lineages, respectively. Thus, JO 1 was identified as a member of L. lutra; JO 2 represented the old <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter</b> lineage, which may be a distinct new species or subspecies of Lutra. We suggest that the ancestral population of the JO 2 lineage migrated to Japan via the land bridge that existed between western Japanese islands and Asian continent at 1. 27 Ma...|$|E

50|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan {{revealed}} some interesting facts about the genes of the <b>Japanese</b> River <b>Otter.</b> For many years, {{it was thought that}} the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies. The name for the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> was then changed from L. l. whiteleyi to Lutra nippon.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the chronological change in people’s interests {{and attitudes toward}} the <b>Japanese</b> <b>otter,</b> which became extinct during the 1990 s, the number and contents of otter-related newspaper articles over 135 years were investigated. This investigation shows that, in the consciousness of people, the otter shifted gradually from being the animal of a neighborhood in the 19 th century, economic value in the early 20 th, conservation need in the late 20 th, and symbolic value after 2000. Presently, the number of otter articles is progressively decreasing owing {{to a lack of}} news...|$|E
40|$|Four {{species of}} river otter inhabit the Asian wetlands, while one species of sea otter {{of which there}} is little {{ecological}} information so far {{is found in the}} coastal areas of northern Japan. Of the river-otters, the status of small-clawed otter, smooth-coated otter and Eurasian otter are fairly well known in most countries, except that there is hardly any information from countries in west Asia. The hairy-nosed otter, which was not recorded for more than two decades, was rediscovered in Thailand and Vietnam in 1999 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, evidence for the presence of hairy-nosed otter was found in Cambodia as well. In highly industrialized Asian countries {{there appears to be no}} wild otter populations, pollution and destruction of otter habitats probably being the major factors that contributed to this extinction. Legal protection is also lacking in some countries and the otters are still being killed for their organs for indigenous medicine and skins for making warm apparels. Asian people in general are unaware of the importance of otter in the wetlands. Therefore, efforts are being made to carryout awareness & training programs and otter surveys, particularly on hairy-nosed otter. In March 2006 a training workshop was held in Nepal on otter survey techniques and a similar training program would probably be held either in Vietnam or in Cambodia in 2008. General surveys on otter are in progress in S. Korea, China, India (North & South) and Sri Lanka, while ecological work on hairy-nosed otter is being carried out in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia (Sumatra). Several of these projects are being funded by the small grants provided by the Columbus Zoo Organization, US, <b>Japanese</b> <b>Otter</b> Specialist Group, Japan & International Otter Survival Fund, UK...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> (Lutra lutra whiteleyi) (Nihon-kawauso) is an extinct {{variety of}} otter {{formerly}} widespread in Japan. Dating {{back to the}} 1880s, it was even seen in Tokyo. The population suddenly shrank in the 1930s, and the mammal nearly vanished. Since then, it has only been spotted several times, in 1964 in the Seto Inland Sea, and in the Uwa Sea in 1972 and 1973. The last official sighting was {{in the southern part}} of Kōchi Prefecture in 1979, when it was photographed in the mouth of the Shinjo River in Susaki. It was subsequently classified as a [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] species on the Japanese Red List. On August 28, 2012, the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> was officially declared extinct by the Ministry of the Environment. It is the official animal symbol of Ehime Prefecture.

50|$|Several genetic {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> should be treated as a distinct species Lutra nippon rather than a subspecies of Lutra lutra. However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{thousands}} of river otters in Japan. Starting in the Meiji period, the government of Japan adopted a policy of increasing wealth and military prowess. Animal pelts thus became very valuable since they could be exported for money. As a result, <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otters</b> started to be hunted throughout the country. Their numbers soon dwindled. Populations made a slight comeback after the creation of hunting regulations. Even so, pollution and human development then harmed their environment and resources to build their habitats. This pollution terminated their food sources in the rivers, causing them to hunt in more dangerous settings. These causes grew rapidly, resulting in the extinction of the <b>Japanese</b> river <b>otter</b> in the late 20th century.|$|R
