40|$|Oxidation {{has been}} studied both as a {{function}} of temperature in the range from 900 to 1300 C and of the partial pressure of oxygen in the range from 0. 05 to 760 torr. In addition, microstructures of oxide scales have been studied and characterized in more detail utilizing metallographic and X-ray techniques combined with electron microprobe analysis. The parabolic rate constants in 1100 C and at 100 and 10 torr oxygen are presented in a graph {{as a function of}} chromium content. Three main different mechanisms of oxidation in the Co-Cr system have been identified. In two of these, the rate determining process controlling the oxidation is the solid state diffusion of cobalt through the oxide CoO. The rate controlling process governing the oxidation for the third mechanism is chromium diffusion in <b>dichromium</b> <b>trioxide...</b>|$|E
