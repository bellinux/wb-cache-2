He was drawn by the excitement that surrounded football and thought a professional team could be profitable.

5|$|Roundabout {{moved into}} Deeves Hall, a rented old {{farmhouse}} {{near the village}} of South Mimms, Hertfordshire in late February 1968. There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up to the standards the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.|$|E

5|$|Though Manekshaw {{initially}} {{thought of}} pursuing {{a career as}} a medical doctor, he later joined the first intake of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) when it was established in 1932. Right <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> at IMA, he proved to be witty and humorous in nature. He was first attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots, and later posted to the 4th Battalion of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, commonly known as the 54th Sikhs. During action in World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Following the partition of India in 1947, he was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War and the Hyderabad crisis, and as a result he never commanded an infantry battalion. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2007, he {{was offered}} a {{short-term}} deal with League Two side Bradford City following a successful trial, teaming back up with Stuart McCall, who Nix knew <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> at Sheffield United. He made his Bradford debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a League Cup game scoring his first senior goal. His league debut came three days later in the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new ground the New Meadow. He was offered a longer term deal at City, before becoming a regular first team player. His first league goal was a long-range equaliser as Bradford drew 1–1 with Chesterfield on 8 December 2007 before he added a second in successive games in a 2–1 defeat to Peterborough United. His goals helped to win him a contract extension in January {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. Later that month he improved his run of goals by scoring in three successive matches to help Bradford to five points from three games within the space of eight days. Nix stayed in the team for the remainder of the season, but it was not until April that he scored again, with a long-range volley against Brentford, as he bid for a new contract for the 2008–09 season. On 29 April 2008, Nix was offered a new deal, which he signed the following week to remain at Bradford for another season.|$|E
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
