When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires.

5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a numerical method for {{the calculation of}} the unstable frequencies of a car <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and the analysis procedure. The stationary components of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> are modelled using finite elements and the disc as a thin plate. This approach facilitates the modelling of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> squeal as a moving load problem. Some uncertain system parameters of the stationary components and the disc are tuned to fit experimental results. A linear, complex-valued, asymmetric eigenvalue formulation is derived for <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> squeal. Predicted unstable frequencies are compared with experimentally established squeal frequencies of a realistic car <b>disc</b> <b>brake...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — These day {{technologies}} {{go beyond}} us. For automotive field, {{the technology of}} engine develops very fast even {{the system of the}} car, luxury or comforts everything that develops by the innovation of engineer. Although the engineer gives priority for safety measure, but most consumers still have inadequate of knowledge in safety system. Thus safety is the first important thing we must focus. This paper is presented with “Thermal analysis of <b>Disc</b> <b>Brake</b> Rotor with slot shape optimization ” which studies about on <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> Rotor by analysis of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s <b>Disc</b> <b>Brake</b> Rotor. Therefore, we can optimize number of shapes of slots to estimate the good thermal conductivity of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> Rotor. In this paper, Thermal analysis done on real model of <b>Disc</b> <b>Brake</b> Rotor of Bajaj Pulsar 220 and Thermal analysis of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> Rotor of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s in one <b>Disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor. Different shapes of slots are because of to reduce the weight of disc rotor and for good thermal conductivity. Hopefully this paper will help everyone to understand Thermal analysis of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor and how <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> works more efficiently, which can help to reduce the accident that may happen in each day...|$|R

5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

40|$|There are {{typically}} two different methodologies {{that can be}} used to predict squeal in a <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> i. e., complex eigenvalue analysis and dynamic transient analysis. The positive real parts of complex eigenvalues indicate the degree of instability of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and are thought to associate with squeal occurrence or noise intensity. On the other hand, instability in the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> can be identified as an initially divergent vibration response using transient analysis. From the literature it appears that the two approaches were performed separately, and their correlation was not much investigated. In addition, there is more than one way of dealing the frictional contact in a <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> This paper explores a proper way of conducting both types of analyses and investigates the correlation between them for a large degree-of-freedom <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> model. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of a real <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> is developed.

25|$|The {{first use}} of <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> in racing was in 1951, one of the BRM Type 15s using a Girling-produced set, a first for a Formula One car.

These brakes helped the company to win the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans, developed in the UK by Dunlop.

40|$|Abstract—To {{reveal the}} {{temperature}} field distribution of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> in downward belt conveyor, mathematical models of heat transfer for <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> were established combined with heat transfer theory.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{prediction}} of contact pressure distributions {{is regarded as}} {{an important step in}} studying <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> squeal noise. Contact analysis forms part of the whole procedure in the complex eigenvalue method. The essence of such a method lies in the asymmetric stiffness matrix derived from the contact stiffness and the friction coefficient at the disc/pads interfaces. This paper presents the analysis of the contact pressure distributions at the disc/pad interfaces using a detailed 3 -dimensional finite element model of a real car <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> A general-purpose commercial software package was utilised and assessed. The paper also investigates different levels in modeling a <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and simulating contact pressure distributions. Having obtained the suitable model, {{prediction of}} interface pressure distributions on an original <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> was carried out. Finally, modifications on the geometry and/or materials of <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> components were performed to search for a more uniform contact pressure distribution. It is believed that a uniform contact pressure distribution could prevent excessive tapered wear on the pads and subsequently could prolong the life of pads...|$|R
