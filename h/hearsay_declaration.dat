40|$|David Schum {{has long}} been one of our keenest {{commentators}} on questions of inference and proof. He has been particularly interested in, and illuminating on, the subject of 2 ̆ 2 cascaded, 2 ̆ 2 or multi-step, inference. 2 ̆ 7 This is a subject of importance to lawyers, because most evidence at trial can be analyzed in terms of cascaded inference. Usually, {{the proposition that the}} fact finder 2 might immediately infer from the evidence is not itself an element of a crime, claim, or defense. Most often, an extra inference would be required to jump from that proposition to a proposition that the law deems material. Thus, inference is complex even when the witness in court testifies to a proposition that the proponent of the evidence asks the fact finder to accept as truthful. Another layer of complexity is added when the in-court evidence is hearsay-that is, evidence that at a prior time some declarant asserted the proposition that the fact finder is asked to accept. 3 Hearsay is therefore a natural subject of inquiry for Schum, on which he now focuses what he calls his 2 ̆ 2 conceptual microscope. 2 ̆ 2 4 Part I of this Comment compares Schum 2 ̆ 7 s breakdown of the testimonial process, which may lead to a <b>hearsay</b> <b>declaration,</b> with the breakdown traditionally offered by evidence scholars. 2 ̆ 7 Part II examines Schum 2 ̆ 7 s model of fact-finding as a backward-looking chain of inferences, and offers a simplified version of another model that integrates forward-looking story lines with Bayesian logic, in a way that might be useful for dealing with evidentiary questions. Part III adds some complexities to this model and examines its workings {{in the context of a}} <b>hearsay</b> <b>declaration.</b> Part IV discusses the broader applicability of the model in other evidentiary contexts. Part V is a brief conclusion suggesting directions for further research related to hearsay...|$|E
40|$|James v. Illinois permits illegally-obtained {{evidence}} to impeach defendants, but not defense witnesses. Thus far, all courts have construed James to allow impeachment of defendants 2 ̆ 7 <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarations.</b> This article argues against allowing illegally-obtained {{evidence to}} impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarations</b> because doing so unduly diminishes the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrent effect. The distinction between impeaching defendants and defense witnesses disappears when courts allow prosecutors to impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarations.</b> Because defense witnesses report exculpatory conduct of a defendant who {{always has a}} substantial interest in disguising his criminality, their testimony routinely incorporates defendant hearsay. Defense witness testimony thus routinely paves the way for illegally-obtained evidence, contradicting James 2 ̆ 7 s intention that substantial deterrence result from prohibiting impeachment of defense witnesses. Moreover, in the few cases finding that defense witnesses 2 ̆ 7 testimony did not invite illegally-obtained evidence by incorporating defendant hearsay, prosecutors overlooked winning evidentiary arguments or the courts made evidentiary errors. The unpredictable nature of these instances of exclusion adds insult to injury: Because competent defense counsel will refrain from calling a defense witness rather than hope for prosecutorial neglect or judicial error, the prosecution benefits from its illegally-obtained proof, eliminating the deterrence James contemplates. Meanwhile, less than competent counsel will stumble into calling defense witnesses and occasionally {{reap the benefits of}} prosecutorial neglect or judicial error when illegally-obtained evidence is not admitted despite its impeaching effect on defendant hearsay. Thus, the status quo imposes costs to the truth without any compensating deterrence of constitutional violations. By comparison, flipping a coin to decide whether prosecutors can use suppressed evidence to impeach would greatly improve matters. It assures that a limited impeachment exception engenders at least some additional deterrence beyond that already provided by suppression on the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s case in chief to justify its truth seeking costs. Flipping a coin is hardly an acceptable solution. Nonetheless, that it improves the status quo vividly illustrates the error of applying the exception to impeach defendant hearsay and the futility of pursuing an impeachment exception whose parameters purport to promote accurate fact finding without undermining the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrence of constitutional violations...|$|R
40|$|The {{common law}} {{has come a}} long way since Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted of treason on the basis of accusations {{contained}} in unproduced letters and the <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarations</b> of unproduced witnesses. However, despite the painstaking development and innumerable formulations and reformulations of the hearsay rule over the past several centuries, there are areas of that body of law which are as yet unsettled and the subject of heated controversy. One such area is that of prior inconsistent statements of witnesses, the controversy over which has continued over the years and has surfaced once again with promulgation of the new Federal Rules of Evidence. Legal theories, like social and cultural philosophies, often follow marked trends and patterns. A few years ago exclusionary rules were on the ascendancy, especially in the area of criminal law, while today it is increased admissibility which is in vogue. Both had their advocates throughout common law history, and will probably always find support. It is a reflection of this current trend that the traditional rules governing substantive use of prior inconsistent statements, once unquestioningly accepted, have since been roundly criticized by authorities from Wigmore to the Supreme Court. The purpose of this article is to attempt to redress the balance just slightly, by setting out some of the counterarguments which lie behind the traditional substantive exclusion of prior inconsistent statements. An attempt will be made to emphasize practical, rather than merely theoretical, considerations...|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} advantage available to a prosecutor in a criminal conspiracy case is {{the exception to the}} hearsay rule for co-conspirator declarations. The exception is widely used and is often {{a significant part of the}} government presentation. In essence, it provides that otherwise inadmissible <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarations</b> of coconspirators are admissible at trial against the defendant so long as they were made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The exception typically arises when an alleged co-conspirator declarant tells the witness (often an undercover police officer) all about the conspiracy, perhaps in the hope of attracting a buyer or a seller of drugs. During the conversation the defendant is identified as a member of the group. The witness then is called to testify at trial about this conversation. Numerous judges and commentators have explored why the exception is so important in a case like this. Basically it is because the declarant is often not available for cross-examination, and the witness is now specifically naming this defendant as having participated in the conspiracy. During the last several years, major changes have taken place which have affected the exception itself, its general application, and proof problems in connection with specific types of conspiracies. While some of these issues have been addressed previously, they have been viewed primarily from the vantage point of persons with expertise in the area of evidence law. Rarely, however, have these problems been analyzed in terms of general criminal law issues such as the quantum of proof required at trial or the procedures to be employed at a conspiracy trial. This article will focus attention on five major aspects of the coconspirator exception shaped considerably by recent events: the structure of the exception, the three elements of the exception, trial procedures utilized in connection with it, confrontation clause challenges to it, and the scope of the conspiracy. Numerous other problems are related to the hearsay exception and indeed can be vital to the trial and appellate practice in conspiracy cases. Nevertheless, such problems have been omitted here either because there have been few recent developments of significance, or because the relation is not close...|$|R
40|$|Reliability {{has been}} defined as 2 ̆ 2 worthy of {{dependence}} 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 of proven consistency in producing satisfactory results. 2 ̆ 2 It is a common concept as well as a quality for which individuals search in their everyday transactions, such as purchasing a car or selecting an express delivery service. It similarly shapes the rules of evidence pertaining to hearsay. Beth common law and modem evidentiary codes ban the admission of extrajudicial statements offered to prove the truth of a matter asserted because they are not made under oath, {{in the presence of the}} trier of fact, and subject to cross-examination. Without these safeguards, the trier of fact cannot evaluate the witness 2 ̆ 7 perception, memory, or narration, and therefore not the statement 2 ̆ 7 s reliability. Furthermore, the use of hearsay denies those against whom the statement is offered the opportunity to both challenge the information itself and confront its declarant. There are, however, instances in which evidence that otherwise would qualify as hearsay possesses sufficient indicia of reliability to merit admission. Some kinds of hearsay provide the trier of fact with a more accurate source of facts than a witness 2 ̆ 7 first hand remembrance of information, and therefore, an exception is made to the rule excluding hearsay. In other cases, exceptions are made because the hearsay has circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that, although not equivalent to in-court testimony, at least provide sufficient reliability so that admission is preferable to the loss of relevant evidence. The <b>hearsay</b> exception for <b>declarations</b> against interest falls into the latter category...|$|R
40|$|This {{piece was}} written for a program held by the American Association of Law Schools Section on Law and Humanities, “Excavating and Integrating Law and Humanities in the Core Curriculum,” on January 5, 2012. When I teach the dying <b>declarations</b> <b>hearsay</b> {{exception}} in my Evidence course, I always show the opening scene from Mel Brooks 2 ̆ 7 s darkly comedic film, The Twelve Chairs. A film clip is a particularly dense piece of storytelling, in that it presents story information in a visually and aurally rich manner (including such varied aspects as images, colors, tone, soundtracks, special effects, edits, montage, etc.). Yet, {{we are able to}} take in and process a whole series of nuanced and complex messages in a film clip in a relatively efficient manner. Simply put, we are good at 2 ̆ 2 reading 2 ̆ 2 visual stories from television and film. Further, showing the excerpt from The Twelve Chairs not only is fun, it 2 ̆ 7 s good learning pedagogy. This short scene enhances class discussion in three principal ways. First, the scene serves as an engaging mini-review of the elements of the hearsay exception for dying declarations. Second, it serves as a springboard for the class to think critically and articulate some unspoken assumptions underpinning the rationale for the rule (the short scene raises issues about our assumptions governing family dynamics, gender, class, politics, and religion, among other matters) and consider the possibility of drafting a different (and perhaps better) rule., Third, the nature of the example (a film clip, and a comedic one at that) surprises and delights the students who are used to the usually bleak and violent fact patterns in many evidence casebooks. Thus, their attention level is high and they are very engaged in the analysis. A more full discussion of each of these three aspects follows...|$|R
