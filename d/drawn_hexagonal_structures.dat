The geometrical arrangement of pixels on hexag-onal structure can be described in terms of a hexagonal grid. Uniformly sepa-rating image into seven similar copies with a smaller scale has commonly been used for parallel and accurate image processing including image compression on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure.</b> However, all the existing hardware for capturing image and for displaying image are produced based on square architecture. It has become a serious problem affecting the advanced research based on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure.</b> Furthermore, the current techniques used for uniform separation of images on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> do not coincide with the rectangular shape of images. This has been an obstacle in the use of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> for image processing. In this paper, we briefly review a newly developed virtual <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> that is scalable. Based on this virtual structure, algorithms for uni-form image separation are presented. The virtual <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> retains image resolution during the process of image separation, and does not intro-duce distortion. Furthermore, images can be smoothly and easily transferred between the traditional square <b>structure</b> and the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> while the image shape is kept in rectangle. As an application of image partitioning, we present a Fractal Image Compression (FIC) method on the virtual image struc-ture by adopting Fisher’s basic FIC method on the traditional square image structure. The modification on the definition of range block and domain block is implemented in order to utilize the enhanced image structure. The results of the FIC approach applied to testing images are analyzed and show higher fidelity...|$|R

In this new hexagonal cellular networks, the principal hexagonal unit cell contains twelve coverage limits in contrast of the usual structure involving only six ones.

40|$|We are all {{familiar}} with the hexagonal shape of snow and ice crystals, and it is well established that their six-fold symmetry {{is derived from the}} arrangement of water molecules in a <b>hexagonal</b> crystal <b>structure.</b> However, atmospheric ice crystals with only three-fold rotational symmetry are often observed, which is inconsistent with the <b>hexagonal</b> crystal <b>structure</b> of ordinary ice. These crystals are found {{in a wide range of}} different cloud types ranging from upper tropospheric cirrus to contrails and diamond dust, and they form at temperatures ranging from about - 84 to - 5 °C. Recent experimental studies of ice crystal structures have shown that ice under a wide range of atmospheric conditions does not always conform to the standard <b>hexagonal</b> crystal <b>structure.</b> Instead, sequences of the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure</b> can be interlaced with cubic sequences to create a stacking disordered ice. This degrades the symmetry of the crystal structure, so that, instead of having a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>structure,</b> they have a trigonal structure with corresponding three-fold symmetry. Hence, this implies that atmospheric ice crystals with three-fold symmetry are made of stacking-disordered ice. We conclude that the presence of trigonal crystals in the atmosphere is consistent with rare Parry arc halos and also show that they have distinct radiative properties compared to hexagonal ice...|$|R
