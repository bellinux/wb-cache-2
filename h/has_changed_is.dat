5000|$|Professor Jimmy Bell, an obesity {{specialist}} at Imperial College London, {{has stated that}} contrary to popular belief, {{the people of the}} United Kingdom have not become greedier or less active in recent years. One thing that <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> the food that they eat, and, more specifically, the sheer amount of sugar they ingest. [...] "We're being bombarded every day by the food industry to consume more and more food. It's a war between our bodies and the demands our body makes, and the accessibility that modern society gives us with food." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{means that}} we do not [...] "receive" [...] the righteousness of God (or as often expressed, [...] "of Jesus") in the {{classical}} Evangelical vernacular, nor is it [...] "infused" [...] in the classical Roman Catholic vernacular.

Paul's argument is that it has always been so, but what <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> that the Messiah, in Jesus of Nazareth, has now appeared.|$|E

50|$|The rise of {{violence}} {{has had a}} considerable impact on Honduran migration. In the past, the reason behind Central Americans traveling to the U.S. was merely economic. Young men traveled {{in search of the}} American Dream and sent revenues to their families back in Honduras. Today the main causes of migration are violence and crime. Another aspect of Central American migration that <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> that migrants are not longer only men, but also women, teenagers and even children. Whole families travel from Honduras to the U.S. in search for a more peaceful life. By 2015 174,000 people, 4% of the country's households had left Honduras.|$|E

The girls now wear a blue blouse with a fitted blazer with the new smaller school badge which looks smarter than the original bigger badge. Girls used to wear a blazer, shirt and tie. The boys' uniform has changed slightly. The only thing that <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> the blazer.|$|E

They also give gay people in Morocco the chance to express themselves. There are young gay Moroccans who created a gay magazine in Arabic. And there’s now an Arabic word for ‘homosexual’ that is not disrespectful: ‘mithly.’ It was created just six years ago, and is now used everywhere.” ...|$|E

5000|$|... 'Manohar Shetty's {{poems are}} pure delight, {{so much so}} that, because you want the {{pleasure}} to last, you read them slowly, one at a time, taking a mental walk after each. A spare richness marked his poems from the start and, over the decades, this hasn’t changed. What <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> that the poems are even more burnished than before. They glow, and {{continue to do so}} long after the page has been turned, the book returned to the shelf... This is poetry so naturally memorable that you don’t need to consciously memorize it.' - Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, on his fourth book Personal Effects (2010).|$|E

These few years are pivotal and they are getting longer. There are now people running round with disposable incomes who still want to do lots of things before they settle down to one partner.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea behind}} {{this section of}} the tax code is that when an {{individual}} or a business sells a property to buy another, no economic gain has been achieved. There has simply been a transfer from one property to another. For example, if a real estate investor sells an apartment building to buy another one, he or she will not be charged tax on any gains he or she made on the original apartment building. When the investor sells the original apartment building and purchases a new one, the value used from the original to buy the new one has not changed - the only thing that <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> where the value resides.|$|E
