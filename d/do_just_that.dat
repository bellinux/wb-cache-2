5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

25|$|When Hussey {{was playing}} for Australia A, the Australian reserve team, Allan Border once jokingly {{suggested}} he get match practice by {{staying in the}} nets for a full six hours; surprisingly, Hussey went on to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
25|$|Warren {{connected}} {{his forces}} before receiving {{a message from}} Meade's chief of staff, Brigadier General and Brevet Major General Alexander S.

25|$|Because {{the courts}} did not {{specifically}} establish abortion as a right, Parliament has leave to legislate on {{this aspect of}} the matter; and in 1989, the Progressive Conservative government attempted to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> A bill was introduced that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolt of}} Mortimer and the Percys very quickly gives him {{his chance to}} <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> The high and the low come {{together}} when the Prince makes up {{with his father and}} is given a high command. He vows to fight and kill the rebel Hotspur, and orders Falstaff (who is, after all, a knight) to take charge of a group of foot soldiers and proceed to the battle site at Shrewsbury.|$|E
25|$|First baseman Dan Johnson {{was signed}} to a $500,000 {{contract}} {{for one year}} on January 11. Johnson, who played the 2009 season in Japan's Central League, {{was regarded as a}} hero for the Rays in the 2008 season for a game-tying solo home run in the 9th inning of a game in early September against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. The Rays, who needed a win that night to keep their division lead over Boston, went on to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

25|$|By this point, the Arabs {{appeared}} to the Romans as invincible, and thus, could only hinder themselves. Fortunately for Byzantium, the Arabs began to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> The Caliph Uthman ibn Affan {{was assassinated in}} Medina. As a result, Ali, the Islamic Prophet Muhammed's son-in law was elected as his successor. However, Muawiya, the governor of Syria who led the Arab fleet against Byzantium, was proclaimed Caliph in Syria, as well. Only when Ali was assassinated in 661 did the civil strife end, much to Byzantium's disappointment.|$|E
25|$|While Turing's proof {{shows that}} there can be no general method or {{algorithm}} to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem may very well be susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact computer scientists often <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> as part of a correctness proof. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no mechanical, general way to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some heuristics that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.|$|E
25|$|International groups {{attempted}} {{to pressure the}} IOC to reject Beijing's bid in protest {{of the state of}} human rights in the People's Republic of China. One Chinese dissident who expressed similar sentiments was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for calling on the IOC to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> {{at the same time that}} IOC inspectors were touring the city. Amnesty International expressed concern in 2006 regarding the Olympic Games to be held in China in 2008, likewise expressing concerns over the human rights situation. The second principle in the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, Olympic Charter states that The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. Amnesty International considers the policies and practices of the People's Republic as failing to meet that principle, and urged the IOC to press China to immediately enact human rights reform.|$|E

500|$|By 25 March the North Vietnamese Politburo {{no longer}} felt it was {{necessary}} to wait until 1976 for the initiation of its final offensive against Saigon. General Dũng was ordered to abandon the long-standing doctrine of meticulous planning and methodical preparation of the battlefield in order that the [...] "puppet" [...] regime could be crushed and the war ended. The only obstacle to that goal was moving his northern forces [...] (the reserve divisions in North Vietnam would have to move [...] ) south in order to participate in the attack on the capital Saigon. In one of the most complex logistical feats of the war, he proceeded to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

[...] Wooden Leg says [...] "our trail...could have been followed by a blind person" [...] since it was between a quarter and half a mile wide. [...] While on a scouting mission, Wooden Leg and his group spotted soldiers coming from the south towards their camp on the Rosebud River. [...] Wooden Leg took part in the ensuing Battle of the Rosebud, in which the soldiers were driven off.|$|E

500|$|A {{serious issue}} facing most {{southern}} schools in 1956 {{was that of}} desegregation. While Middleton, like most white Louisianans, {{was in favor of}} segregation, as the university president his responsibility was to uphold the laws of the state and nation, and his intention was to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> In April he wrote a sobering report to the Board of Supervisors entitled [...] "LSU and Segregation." [...] Here he outlined the history of the enrollment of blacks at LSU, which showed how resistant the university had been to such an undertaking. While there were avid segregationists who declared the federal desegregation laws would not be fulfilled, more practical minds could see the futility and extreme expense of having to create duplicate facilities in every area of advanced education, and the process of integration, which had already begun at a slow pace, now became accelerated.|$|E
500|$|If Hurcomb {{persisted in}} {{adhering}} to his {{terms of reference}} and approved the power station, but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent {{on the grounds of}} the objections, NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site. [...] The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of the question that they would be able to afford the large amount involved and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves. [...] If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> [...] Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed. The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times, and Frank Tribe, secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, wrote to Hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring the inquiry to a decision.|$|E
500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E
