50|$|The sausage is boiled <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> (often {{with other}} parts of the animal not roasted and used to make soup) for 30 - 45 minutes, and roasted over coals till brown. Sliced, it is served with kachumbari, an onion based salad {{consisting}} of tomatoes, red onions and fresh coriander, a bit of chili and squeeze of lemon. The accompanying starch is ugali.|$|E
50|$|The {{prepared}} cakes are tightly arranged <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot,</b> the pot {{is filled}} with fresh water and boiled for hours until they are done from the inside stuffing to outside. After cooling and unwrapping, the rice skin of bánh chưng turns green because rice has absorbed the colour of lá dong. One bánh chưng is often divided in 8 parts, usually by using the very giang string which bound the wrap of the cake. As a cake formed from several ingredients, the taste of bánh chưng varies from part to part with different flavours of glutinous rice, pork, bean and even the wrapping lá dong. Bánh chưng is often served with pickled onions or vegetables, chả lụa and nước mắm. After unwrapping, bánh chưng can stay good for several days while a wrapped one can be kept for two weeks. Bánh chưng has the water activity value aw of about 0.95 and its pH is approximately 6.4.|$|E
50|$|Although Dave Brook's {{vision for}} the Three Counties System has come to fruition, there is {{considerable}} scope for extending it in both directions. To the north in Barbondale, Aygill Caverns is known to drain into Bull Pot of the Witches, but a route through the underwater passages {{has yet to be}} negotiated. This would add 2.5 km to the total system. Further north still, a major abandoned route in Aygill Cavers known as New Year Passage, heads up the Barbondale valley, and may connect with other known caves. To the south, explorations <b>in</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Pot</b> have extended the current system to within 500 m of Kingsdale Beck. Marble Steps, a major active system with large fossil fragments, could well be connected to Rift Pot. Marble Steps, some of Large Pot, and Low Douk Cave are all known to drain to Keld Head - a connection by diving would integrate both the West Kingsdale System (9 km long) and the East Kingsdale System (7 km long) into the system.|$|E

40|$|The root-knot {{nematode}} Meloidogyne graminicola {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious nematode pests worldwide and represents a major constraint on rice production. While variation in the susceptibility of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) exists, so far no strong and reliable resistance has been reported. Quantitative trait loci for partial resistance have been reported but no underlying genes have been tagged or cloned. Here, 332 accessions of the Rice Diversity Panel 1 were assessed for gall formation, revealing large variation across all subpopulations of rice and higher susceptibility in temperate japonica accessions. Accessions Khao Pahk Maw and LD 24 appeared to be resistant, which was confirmed <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> experiments where no galls were observed. Detailed observations on these two accessions revealed no nematodes inside the roots 2 days after inoculation and very few females after 17 days (5 in Khao Pahk Maw and 100 in the susceptible controls). These two cultivars appear ideal donors for breeding root-knot nematode resistance. A genome-wide association study revealed 11 quantitative trait loci, two of which are close to epistatic loci detected in the Bala x Azucena population. The discussion highlights a small number of candidate genes worth exploring further, in particular many genes with lectin domains and genes on chromosome 11 with homology to the Hordeum Mla locus...|$|E

5000|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the extraction of salt. The Muisca, known as [...] "The Salt People" [...] due to their salt mines in Zipaquirá, Nemocón and Tausa, extracted salt by evaporating brines <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pots.</b> They used the salt in their cuisine, for the preparation of dried fish and meat and as product in their economy.|$|R

50|$|Extremadura, Spain {{is known}} for its {{different}} ways of preparing the Iberian pork and mutton. The main characteristics of the traditional Extremaduran cuisine were its simplicity, its lack of clutter and its low cost. It is also a cuisine reflecting a generous spirit, for many of its preparations used to be cooked <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pots</b> to share with visitors, friends and neighbors.

These villages were individually ruled by caciques who at the same time paid tribute to the zipa, ruler of Bacatá.

50|$|It {{can grow}} in part-shaded places, with acidic soils within gardens. It will grow well, when planted in a {{butterfly}} garden. It {{can also be}} classed as a bog garden plant, tolerating waterside edges. During the winter period, depending on {{the severity of the}} winter, the leaves generally die, to re-grow next spring. When, new plants are planted, they take a year to settle in before flowering.They can be grown <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pots</b> or containers. It is rare in cultivation in the UK, as it is not very hardy.|$|R
50|$|Most {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} cayenne, Capsicum annuum, {{can be grown}} {{in a variety of}} locations including tropical and temperate zones and need around 100 days to mature. Peppers prefer warm, moist, nutrient-rich soil in a warm climate. The plants grow to about 0.5 - 1 m in height and should be spaced 1 m apart. In gardens, the plants may be planted as close as 30 cm apart in a raised bed, or simply grown <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pots.</b> This may reduce the yield of an individual plant, but will increase yields per unit area.|$|R

50|$|Since many locales outlaw {{building}} fires on beaches, and {{in order}} to accommodate the dish in homes or backyards, this dish is often prepared <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>pot.</b> This is known as a New England clam boil. Some caterers specialize in clam bakes on the beach.|$|R
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>pots</b> or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|R
