5|$|The {{block and}} article were controversial, {{generating}} articles on other websites about them, {{and the broader}} issue of advertising ethics.

5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Gray was {{planning}} to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he {{was found dead in}} an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, {{the cause of death was}} confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1917, the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos {{to his father}} and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait {{until the end of}} the war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1969, while {{paying a}} visit to the {{northern}} town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on 21 October 1969 (the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition— essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{showed a}} natural talent for dirt track racing and began winning local races. In 1968, his race results drew the {{attention}} of a local Suzuki dealer Bud Aksland, who offered to sponsor Roberts aboard a Suzuki motorcycle. He made the decision to drop out of high school before his senior year to pursue a career in motorcycle racing. Roberts was allowed to compete professionally when he turned 18, and on the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> eighteenth birthday, he entered his first professional race at San Francisco's Cow Palace, finishing in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day.

Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E
