5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling {{him and his}} family from Syria, Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed.

5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in <b>establishing</b> <b>and</b> funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years <b>establishing</b> <b>and</b> expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E
