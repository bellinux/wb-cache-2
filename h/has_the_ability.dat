5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues.

Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation {{is sent to the}} House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
