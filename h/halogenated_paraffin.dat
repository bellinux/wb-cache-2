25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{are fully}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>paraffin</b> {{hydrocarbons}} that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly {{known by the}} DuPont brand name Freon. The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|E
50|$|Research on {{fire-retardant}} polymers was {{bolstered by}} {{the need for new}} types of synthetic polymers in World War II. The combination of a <b>halogenated</b> <b>paraffin</b> and antimony oxide was found to be successful as a fire retardant for canvas tenting. Synthesis of polymers, such as polyesters, with fire retardant monomers were also developed around this time. Incorporating flame-resistant additives into polymers became a common and relatively cheap way to reduce the flammability of polymers, while synthesizing intrinsically fire-resistant polymers has remained a more expensive alternative, although the properties of these polymers are usually more efficient at deterring combustion.|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} {{rates of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) were measured to investigate the emission characteristics of five types of common furniture products using a 5 [*]m 3 size chamber at 25 °C and 50 % humidity. The results indicated that toluene and α-pinene are the most dominant components. The emission rates of individual components decreased constantly through time, approaching the equilibrium emission level. The relative ordering of their emission rates, if assessed in terms of total VOC (TVOC), can be arranged as follows: dining table > sofa > desk chair > bedside table > cabinet. If the emission rates of VOCs are examined between different chemical groups, {{they can also be}} arranged in the following order: aromatic (AR) > terpenes (TER) > carbonyl (CBN) > others > paraffin (PR) > olefin (HOL) > <b>halogenated</b> <b>paraffin</b> (HPR). In addition, if emission strengths are compared between coated and uncoated furniture, there is no significant difference in terms of emission magnitude. Our results indicate that the emission characteristics of VOC are greatly distinguished between different furniture products in terms of relative dominance between different chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Dehalogenation for the {{recycling}} of polymer blends {{has been studied}} on polystyrene and polypropylene containing poly-dibromostyrene and on ABS capolymer and plystyrene containing <b>halogenated</b> compounds (<b>halogenated</b> <b>paraffins,</b> tetrabromobisphenol A, decabromodiphenylether, hexabromocyclododecane) as flame retardant additives. After dissolving the resins in benzene, tetrahydrofurane or methylethylketone, the halogenated additives can be extracted with methanol or butanol. During the extraction process the polymer undergoes partial chain destruction. Such a destruction is omitted using the chemical reaction with sodium, which leads to quantitative dehalogenation. Highest values for the reaction rate are obtained with liquid sodium and high-boiling aliphatic ethers as the solvents. This dehalogenation method can be extended to similar resin systems and allows the separation of antimony trioxide. A study on the economic efficiency demonstrates the potential value of this process for {{the recycling}} of thermoplastics containing bromine substituted additives.
