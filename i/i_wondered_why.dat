It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vision of}} Mary was {{described}} as being beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white cloak, hanging in full folds and fastened at the neck. The crown appeared of a golden brightness, of a deeper hue, than the striking whiteness of the robe she wore; the upper parts of the crown {{appeared to be a}} series of sparkles, or glittering crosses. She {{was described as}} [...] "deep in prayer", with her eyes raised to heaven, her hands raised to the shoulders or a little higher, the palms inclined slightly to the shoulders. Bridget Trench [...] "went in immediately to kiss, as I thought, the feet of the Blessed Virgin; but I felt nothing in the embrace but the wall, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> I could not feel with my hands the figures which I had so plainly and so distinctly seen".|$|E
