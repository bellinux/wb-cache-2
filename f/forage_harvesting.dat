40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the long-term impact of P and K nutrition on yield and yield components, and taproot physiology and biochemistry of alfalfa. Treatments were the factorial combinations of four P rates (0, 25, 50, and 75 kg P ha− 1) and five K rates (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 kg K ha− 1) arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. <b>Forage</b> <b>harvests</b> occurred four times annually, and yield, mass shoot− 1, and shoots areas − 1 were determined. Roots were dug and plant populations determined in early December and following the first <b>forage</b> <b>harvest</b> (late May) in each year as well as following each <b>forage</b> <b>harvest</b> in 2002 and 2003 to ascertain when alfalfa populations were declining. Taproots also were sampled after defoliation in June 2002 and 2003 (Days 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 30), September 2002 and 2003 (Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84), and weekly following the ending of winter dormancy in 2003 and 2004 through the first <b>forage</b> <b>harvest</b> in May 17. Additions of P and K increased alfalfa yield. Yield was most positively associated with yield per shoot not shoots per area or plants per area. Plant populations were consistently decreased with addition of P, but were maintained at higher levels with K fertilizer application. Decreases in alfalfa population occurred primarily during the summer and not over-winter. Addition of K fertilizer increased organic taproot reserves (starch, sugar, protein, and amino-N) during the summer, fall acclimation, and spring regrowth sampling periods with the exception of taproot sugar concentrations, which generally decreased P and K fertilization. Additions of P did not consistently influence any of the taproot C and N pools across sample times. Taproot VSP protein abundance was dramatically reduced after defoliation in alfalfa fertilized with P, but not K, while taproot VSP levels in alfalfa proved both P and K were relatively constant after shoot removal. Knowledge of the mechanisms that enhance alfalfa performance and how these mechanisms are influenced by P and K fertilization will lead {{to a better understanding of}} why these nutrients are vital to increase yield and persistence in alfalfa. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} for 3 yr (2005 through 2007) near Scottsbluff, NE, to examine weed control, crop safety, forage production, and economics of glyphosate-tolerant and conventional alfalfa establishment systems. Glyphosate applied to alfalfa at the unifoliate growth stage provided 67 % weed control and {{was similar to}} imazamox applied at the two-trifoliate leaf stage. Delaying glyphosate application until alfalfa had reached the two-trifoliate growth stage improved weed control to 83 %, and weed control was similar to imazamox plus 2, 4 -DB and imazethapyr plus 2, 4 -DB. Imazamox and imazethapyr caused minor crop injury, {{and the addition of}} bromoxynil or 2, 4 -DB to both herbicides further decreased crop safety. Weeds were most competitive with the first <b>forage</b> <b>harvest</b> and reduced relative feed value, crude protein, and value (dollars per t) of forage compared to forage that had been treated with herbicides. The total forage yield for the season consisted of three <b>forage</b> <b>harvests</b> and was greatest when no herbicides were applied. The total forage yield of plots treated with glyphosate at the two-trifoliate growth stage was greater than that of plots treated with imazamox or imazethapyr in combination with bromoxynil. When glyphosate was applied at the two-trifoliate growth stage, seasonal forage yield was similar to forage treated with imazamox, imazethapyr, or both herbicides in combination with 2, 4 -DB.

It was utilized a factorial arrenge-ment 4 x 5, 4 crop managements (M 1 = cactus <b>forage</b> <b>harvested</b> at 12 months after establishment; M 2 = cactus <b>forage</b> <b>harvested</b> at 12 months after the first regrowth; M 3 = harvested of the accumulated production in 24 months and M 4 = sum of the first production and regrowth) and five levels of goat manure: 0; 5; 10; 15 e 20 Mg ha- 1. It was evaluated the fresh matter production (FMP) and dry matter production (DMP), water accumula-tion, rainfall use efficiency (RUE) and percentage of the water accumulation in the plant. The largest level of organic fertilizer promoted an increase in FMP of 275, 171, 184, 203 % and DMP: 305, 175, 223, 218 %, re-spectively, when comparing the highest level of fertilizer with the unfertilized treatment, and an increase in water accumulation 115. 60, 102. 93, 166. 95, 218. 53 kg of water ha- 1 when comparing the highest level with the unfertilized treatment. The organic fertilization in M 1, M 2, M 3 and M 4 managements, despite of the levels, promoted a linear increase in the RUE.

40|$|Pastures {{have always}} been and will {{continue}} to be a source of forages and nutrients for dairy cattle, including heifers, dry cows, and the milking herd. During the 1950 s and early 1960 s, pasture was replaced by confinement feeding of stored forages as the preferred means of feeding and managing the milking herd. These changes allowed the amount and quality of forages and concentrates fed to dairy cows to be controlled so milk production could be maximized.

40|$|The {{relative}} increment {{in daily}} maintenance requirement by physical activity was estimated in free-grazing cattle. The effects of <b>forage</b> <b>harvesting</b> and walking were measured and expressed as an index {{in relation to}} the value of energy expenditure of animals in corrals. All indices were obtained from experiments conducted in Balcarce (Argentina) from 1993 to 1995. Energy expenditure of Aberdeen Angus steers was estimated by the 14 C-entry rate technique, on animals standing still in a corral, grazing at two different biting rates or walking at four different speeds. Information on time spent on grazing and distance traveled was obtained from the literature. These estimations indicate that the maintenance cost of cattle in corrals could be increased on pastures by a factor of 1. 08 to 1. 30, depending upon the grazing conditions. It was observed that grazing at high biting rate was the variable of highest effect on maintenance energy cost, and that walking or grazing at moderate biting rate was of lower incidence...|$|E
