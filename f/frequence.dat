The program is divided into standard (Ivory), Elite (Silver) and Elite Plus (Gold and Platinum) statuses. Ivory is the basic level which is attained upon entry into the program. Elite status is attained by accruing {{a certain number of}} miles within one calendar year. Elite Silver, Elite Plus Gold, and Elite Plus Platinum cards have added benefits. An invitation-only card called Club 2000 is attributed to some VIPs, celebrities and politicians. Officially, it provides the same benefits as Platinum status but numerous sources confirm it almost guarantees upgrade to Business or La Première. Flying Blue succeeded Air France's previous {{frequent flyer program}}, <b>Fréquence</b> Plus, which operated until the Air France-KLM merger in 2003.|$|E
500|$|Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are {{available}} only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous necrosis. [...] They usually appear within {{the first month of}} treatment albeit their <b>frequence</b> and importance diminish after six months of use. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop.|$|E

[...] Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell, [...] 180 [...] And devilish machinations come to nought. [...] So they in Heav'n their Odes and Vigils tun'd: [...] Mean while the Son of God, who yet some days [...] Lodg'd in Bethabara where John baptiz'd, [...] Musing and much revolving in his brest, [...] How best the mighty work he might begin [...] Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first [...] Publish his God-like office now mature, [...] One day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit leading; [...] And his deep thoughts, the better to converse [...] 190 [...] With solitude, till far from track of men, [...] Thought following thought, and step by step led on, [...] He entred now the bordering Desert wild, [...] And with dark shades and rocks environ'd round, [...] His holy Meditations thus persu'd. [...] O what a multitude of thoughts at once [...] Awakn'd in me swarm, while I consider [...] What from within I feel my self and hear [...] What from without comes often to my ears, [...] Ill sorting with my present state compar'd. [...] 200 [...] When I was yet a child, no childish play [...] To me was pleasing, all my mind was set [...] Serious to learn and know, and thence to do [...] What might be publick good; my self I thought [...] Born to that end, born to promote all truth, [...] All righteous things: therefore above my years, [...] The Law of God I read, and found it sweet, [...] Made it my whole delight, and in it grew [...] To such perfection, that e're yet my age [...] Had measur'd twice six years, at our great Feast [...] 210 [...] I went into the Temple, there to hear [...] The Teachers of our Law, and to propose [...] What might improve my knowledge or their own; [...] And was admir'd by all, yet this not all [...] To which my Spirit aspir'd, victorious deeds [...] Flam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one while [...] To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke, [...] Thence to subdue and quell o're all the earth [...] Brute violence and proud Tyrannick pow'r, [...] Till truth were freed, and equity restor'd: [...] 220 [...] Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first [...] By winning words to conquer willing hearts, [...] And make perswasion do the work of fear; [...] At least to try, and teach the erring Soul [...] Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware [...] Misled: the stubborn only to subdue. [...] These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving [...] By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd, [...] And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts [...] O Son, but nourish them and let them soar [...] 230 [...] To what highth sacred vertue and true worth [...] Can raise them, though above example high; [...] By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire. [...] For know, thou art no Son of mortal man, [...] Though men esteem thee low of Parentage, [...] Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules [...] All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men, [...] A messenger from God fore-told thy birth [...] Conceiv'd in me a Virgin, he fore-told [...] Thou shouldst be great and sit on David's Throne. [...] 240 [...] And of thy Kingdom there should be no end. [...] At thy Nativity a glorious Quire [...] Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung [...] To Shepherds watching at their folds by night, [...] And told them the Messiah now was born, [...] Where they might see him, and to thee they came; [...] Directed to the Manger where thou lais't, [...] For in the Inn was left no better room: [...] A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing [...] Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, [...] 250 [...] To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold, [...] By whose bright course led on they found the place, [...] Affirming it thy Star new grav'n in Heaven, [...] By which they knew thee King of Israel born. [...] Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, warn'd [...] By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake [...] Before the Altar and the vested Priest, [...] Like things of thee to all that present stood. [...] This having heard, strait I again revolv'd [...] The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ [...] 260 [...] Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes [...] Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake [...] I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie [...] Through many a hard assay even to the death, [...] E're I the promis'd Kingdom can attain, [...] Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins [...] Full weight must be transferr'd upon my head. [...] Yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd, [...] The time prefixt I waited, when behold [...] The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, [...] 270 [...] Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come [...] Before Messiah and his way prepare. [...] I as all others to his Baptism came, [...] Which I believ'd was from above; but he [...] Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd [...] Me him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven) [...] Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first [...] Refus'd on me his Baptism to confer, [...] As much his greater, and was hardly won; [...] But as I rose out of the laving stream, [...] 280 [...] Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence [...] The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, [...] And last the sum of all, my Father's voice, [...] Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his, [...] Me his beloved Son, in whom alone [...] He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time [...] Now full, that I no more should live obscure, [...] But openly begin, as best becomes [...] The Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven. [...] And now by some strong motion I am led [...] 290 [...] Into this wilderness, to what intent [...] I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; [...] For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. [...] So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, [...] And looking round on every side beheld [...] A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; [...] The way he came not having mark'd, return [...] Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; [...] And he still on was led, but with such thoughts [...] Accompanied of things past and to come [...] 300 [...] Lodg'd in his brest, as well might recommend [...] Such Solitude before choicest Society. [...] Full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill [...] Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night [...] Under the covert of some ancient Oak, [...] Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, [...] Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd; [...] Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt [...] Till those days ended, hunger'd then at last [...] Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, [...] 310 [...] Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk [...] The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, [...] The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof. [...] But now an aged man in Rural weeds, [...] Following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray Ewe, [...] Or wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve [...] Against a Winters day when winds blow keen, [...] To warm him wet return'd from field at Eve, [...] He saw approach, who first with curious eye [...] Perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake. [...] 320 [...] Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place [...] So far from path or road of men, who pass [...] In Troop or Caravan, for single none [...] Durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here [...] His Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth? [...] I ask the rather and the more admire, [...] For that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late [...] Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford [...] Of Jordan honour'd so, and call'd thee Son [...] Of God: I saw and heard, for we sometimes [...] 330 [...] Who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth [...] To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far) [...] Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, [...] What happ'ns new; Fame also finds us out. [...] To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither [...] Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek, [...] By Miracle he may, reply'd the Swain, [...] What other way I see not, for we here [...] Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd [...] More then the Camel, and to drink go far, [...] 340 [...] Men to much misery and hardship born; [...] But if thou be the Son of God, Command [...] That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; [...] So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve [...] With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. [...] He ended, and the Son of God reply'd. [...] Think'st thou such force in Bread? is it not written [...] (For I discern thee other then thou seem'st) [...] Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word [...] Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed [...] 350 [...] Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount [...] Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, [...] And forty days Eliah without food [...] Wandred this barren waste, the same I now: [...] Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, [...] Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art? [...] Whom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now undisguis'd. [...] 'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate, [...] Who leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt [...] Kept not my happy Station, but was driv'n [...] 360 [...] With them from bliss to the bottomless deep, [...] Vet to that hideous place not so confin'd [...] By rigour unconniving, but that oft [...] Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy [...] Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth, [...] Or range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of Heav'ns [...] Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. [...] I came among the Sons of God, when he [...] Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job [...] To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; [...] 370 [...] And when to all his Angels he propos'd [...] To draw the proud King Ahab into fraud [...] That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring, [...] I undertook that office, and the tongues [...] Of all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with lyes [...] To his destruction, as I had in charge. [...] For what he bids I do; though I have lost [...] Much lustre of my native brightness, lost [...] To be belov'd of God, I have not lost [...] To love, at least contemplate and admire [...] 380 [...] What I see excellent in good, or fair, [...] Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense. [...] What can be then less in me then desire [...] To see thee and approach thee, whom I know [...] Declar'd the Son of God, to hear attent [...] Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds? [...] Men generally think me much a foe [...] To all mankind: why should I? they to me [...] Never did wrong or violence, by them [...] I lost not what I lost, rather by them [...] 390 [...] I gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them dwell [...] Copartner in these Regions of the World, [...] If not disposer; lend them oft my aid, [...] Oft my advice by presages and signs, [...] And answers, oracles, portents and dreams, [...] Whereby they may direct their future life. [...] Envy they say excites me, thus to gain [...] Companions of my misery and wo. [...] At first it may be; but long since with wo [...] Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof, [...] 400 [...] That fellowship in pain divides not smart, [...] Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. [...] Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd: [...] This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man, [...] Man fall'n shall be restor'd, I never more. [...] To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply'd. [...] Deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes [...] From the beginning, and in lies wilt end; [...] Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come [...] Into the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st indeed, [...] 410 [...] As a poor miserable captive thrall, [...] Comes to the place where he before had sat [...] Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd, [...] Ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd, [...] A spectacle of ruin or of scorn [...] To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place [...] Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, [...] Rather inflames thy torment, representing [...] Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, [...] So never more in Hell then when in Heaven. [...] 420 [...] But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King. [...] Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear [...] Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? [...] What but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem [...] Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him [...] With all inflictions, but his patience won? [...] The other service was thy chosen task, [...] To be a lyer in four hundred mouths; [...] For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. [...] Yet thou pretend'st to truth; all Oracles [...] 430 [...] By thee are giv'n, and what confest more true [...] Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft, [...] By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. [...] But what have been thy answers, what but dark [...] Ambiguous and with double sense deluding, [...] Which they who ask'd have seldom understood, [...] And not well understood as good not known? [...] Who ever by consulting at thy shrine [...] Return'd the wiser, or the more instruct [...] To flye or follow what concern'd him most, [...] 440 [...] And run not sooner to his fatal snare? [...] For God hath justly giv'n the Nations up [...] To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell [...] Idolatrous, but when his purpose is [...] Among them to declare his Providence [...] To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, [...] But from him or his Angels President [...] In every Province, who themselves disdaining [...] To approach thy Temples, give thee in command [...] What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say [...] 450 [...] To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear, [...] Or like a Fawning Parasite obey'st; [...] Then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told. [...] But this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd; [...] No more shalt thou by oracling abuse [...] The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, [...] And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice [...] Shalt be enquir'd at Delphos or elsewhere, [...] At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. [...] God hath now sent his living Oracle [...] 460 [...] Into the World, to teach his final will, [...] And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell [...] In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle [...] To all truth requisite for men to know. [...] So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, [...] Though inly stung with anger and disdain, [...] Dissembl'd, and this answer smooth return'd. [...] Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, [...] And urg'd me hard with doings, which not will [...] But misery hath rested from me; where [...] 470 [...] Easily canst thou find one miserable, [...] And not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth; [...] If it may stand him more in stead to lye, [...] Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? [...] But thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord; [...] From thee I can and must submiss endure [...] Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. [...] Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, [...] Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear, [...] And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song; [...] 480 [...] What wonder then if I delight to hear [...] Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire [...] Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me [...] To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) [...] And talk at least, though I despair to attain. [...] Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, [...] Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest [...] To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister [...] About his Altar, handling holy things, [...] Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice [...] 490 [...] To Balaam reprobate, a Prophet yet [...] Inspir'd; disdain not such access to me. [...] To whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow [...] Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, [...] I bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st [...] Permission from above; thou canst not more. [...] He added not; and Satan bowing low [...] His gray dissimulation, disappear'd [...] Into thin Air diffus'd: for now began [...] Night with her sullen wing to double-shade [...] 500 [...] The Desert Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't; [...] And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.|$|E

[...] Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite [...] Into the desert, his victorious field [...] Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence [...] 10 [...] By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, [...] As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute, [...] And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds, [...] With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds [...] Above heroic, though in secret done, [...] And unrecorded left through many an age: [...] Worthy to have not remained so long unsung. [...] Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice [...] More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried [...] Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand [...] 20 [...] To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked [...] With awe the regions round, and with them came [...] From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed [...] To the flood Jordan--came as then obscure, [...] Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon [...] Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore [...] As to his worthier, and would have resigned [...] To him his heavenly office. Nor was long [...] His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized [...] Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove [...] 30 [...] The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice [...] From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son. [...] That heard the Adversary, who, roving still [...] About the world, at that assembly famed [...] Would not be last, and, with the voice divine [...] Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom [...] Such high attest was given a while surveyed [...] With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage, [...] Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air [...] To council summons all his mighty Peers, [...] 40 [...] Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved, [...] A gloomy consistory; and them amidst, [...] With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:-- [...] "O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World [...] (For much more willingly I mention Air, [...] This our old conquest, than remember Hell, [...] Our hated habitation), well ye know [...] How many ages, as the years of men, [...] This Universe we have possessed, and ruled [...] In manner at our will the affairs of Earth, [...] 50 [...] Since Adam and his facile consort Eve [...] Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since [...] With dread attending when that fatal wound [...] Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve [...] Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven [...] Delay, for longest time to Him is short; [...] And now, too soon for us, the circling hours [...] This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we [...] Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound [...] (At least, if so we can, and by the head [...] 60 [...] Broken be not intended all our power [...] To be infringed, our freedom and our being [...] In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)-- [...] For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed, [...] Destined to this, is late of woman born. [...] His birth to our just fear gave no small cause; [...] But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying [...] All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve [...] Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. [...] Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim [...] 70 [...] His coming, is sent harbinger, who all [...] Invites, and in the consecrated stream [...] Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so [...] Purified to receive him pure, or rather [...] To do him honour as their King. All come, [...] And he himself among them was baptized-- [...] Not thence to be more pure, but to receive [...] The testimony of Heaven, that who he is [...] Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw [...] The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising [...] 80 [...] Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds [...] Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head [...] A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant); [...] And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard, [...] 'This is my Son beloved,--in him am pleased.' [...] His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire [...] He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven; [...] And what will He not do to advance his Son? [...] His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, [...] When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep; [...] 90 [...] Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems [...] In all his lineaments, though in his face [...] The glimpses of his Father's glory shine. [...] Ye see our danger on the utmost edge [...] Of hazard, which admits no long debate, [...] But must with something sudden be opposed [...] (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares), [...] Ere in the head of nations he appear, [...] Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth. [...] I, when no other durst, sole undertook [...] 100 [...] The dismal expedition to find out [...] And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed [...] Successfully: a calmer voyage now [...] Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once [...] Induces best to hope of like success." [...] He ended, and his words impression left [...] Of much amazement to the infernal crew, [...] Distracted and surprised with deep dismay [...] At these sad tidings. But no time was then [...] For long indulgence to their fears or grief: [...] 110 [...] Unanimous they all commit the care [...] And management of this man enterprise [...] To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt [...] At first against mankind so well had thrived [...] In Adam's overthrow, and led their march [...] From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light, [...] Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods, [...] Of many a pleasant realm and province wide. [...] So to the coast of Jordan he directs [...] His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles, [...] 120 [...] Where he might likeliest find this new-declared, [...] This man of men, attested Son of God, [...] Temptation and all guile on him to try-- [...] So to subvert whom he suspected raised [...] To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed: [...] But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled [...] The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed, [...] Of the Most High, who, in full <b>frequence</b> bright [...] Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:-- [...] "Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold, [...] 130 [...] Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth [...] With Man or men's affairs, how I begin [...] To verify that solemn message late, [...] On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure [...] In Galilee, that she should bear a son, [...] Great in renown, and called the Son of God. [...] Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be [...] To her a virgin, that on her should come [...] The Holy Ghost, {{and the power of}} the Highest [...] O'ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown, [...] 140 [...] To shew him worthy of his birth divine [...] And high prediction, henceforth I expose [...] To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay [...] His utmost subtlety, because he boasts [...] And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng [...] Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt [...] Less overweening, since he failed in Job, [...] Whose constant perseverance overcame [...] Whate'er his cruel malice could invent. [...] He now shall know I can produce a man, [...] 150 [...] Of female seed, far abler to resist [...] All his solicitations, and at length [...] All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell-- [...] Winning by conquest what the first man lost [...] By fallacy surprised. But first I mean [...] To exercise him in the Wilderness; [...] There he shall first lay down the rudiments [...] Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth [...] To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes. [...] By humiliation and strong sufferance [...] 160 [...] His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength, [...] And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; [...] That all the Angels and aethereal Powers-- [...] They now, and men hereafter--may discern [...] From what consummate virtue I have chose [...] This perfet man, by merit called my Son, [...] To earn salvation for the sons of men." [...] So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven [...] Admiring stood a space; then into hymns [...] Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved, [...] 170 [...] Circling the throne and singing, while the hand [...] Sung with the voice, and this the argument:-- [...] "Victory and triumph to the Son of God, [...] Now entering his great duel, not of arms, [...] But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles! [...] The Father knows the Son; therefore secure [...] Ventures his filial virtue, though untried, [...] Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce, [...] Allure, or terrify, or undermine. [...] Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell, [...] 180 [...] And, devilish machinations, come to nought!" [...] So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned. [...] Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days [...] Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized, [...] Musing and much revolving in his breast [...] How best the mighty work he might begin [...] Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first [...] Publish his godlike office now mature, [...] One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading [...] And his deep thoughts, the better to converse [...] 190 [...] With solitude, till, far from track of men, [...] Thought following thought, and step by step led on, [...] He entered now the bordering Desert wild, [...] And, with dark shades and rocks environed round, [...] His holy meditations thus pursued:-- [...] "O what a multitude of thoughts at once [...] Awakened in me swarm, while I consider [...] What from within I feel myself, and hear [...] What from without comes often to my ears, [...] Ill sorting with my present state compared! [...] 200 [...] When I was yet a child, no childish play [...] To me was pleasing; all my mind was set [...] Serious to learn and know, and thence to do, [...] What might be public good; myself I thought [...] Born to that end, born to promote all truth, [...] All righteous things. Therefore, above my years, [...] The Law of God I read, and found it sweet; [...] Made it my whole delight, and in it grew [...] To such perfection that, ere yet my age [...] Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast [...] 210 [...] I went into the Temple, there to hear [...] The teachers of our Law, and to propose [...] What might improve my knowledge or their own, [...] And was admired by all. Yet this not all [...] To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds [...] Flamed in my heart, heroic acts--one while [...] To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke; [...] Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth, [...] Brute violence and proud tyrannic power, [...] Till truth were freed, and equity restored: [...] 220 [...] Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first [...] By winning words to conquer willing hearts, [...] And make persuasion do the work of fear; [...] At least to try, and teach the erring soul, [...] Not wilfully misdoing, but unware [...] Misled; the stubborn only to subdue. [...] These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving, [...] By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced, [...] And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts, [...] O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar [...] 230 [...] To what highth sacred virtue and true worth [...] Can raise them, though above example high; [...] By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire. [...] For know, thou art no son of mortal man; [...] Though men esteem thee low of parentage, [...] Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules [...] All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men. [...] A messenger from God foretold thy birth [...] Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold [...] Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne, [...] 240 [...] And of thy kingdom there should be no end. [...] At thy nativity a glorious quire [...] Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung [...] To shepherds, watching at their folds by night, [...] And told them the Messiah now was born, [...] Where they might see him; and to thee they came, [...] Directed to the manger where thou lay'st; [...] For in the inn was left no better room. [...] A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing, [...] Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, [...] 250 [...] To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold; [...] By whose bright course led on they found the place, [...] Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven, [...] By which they knew thee King of Israel born. [...] Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned [...] By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake, [...] Before the altar and the vested priest, [...] Like things of thee to all that present stood.' [...] This having heart, straight I again revolved [...] The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ [...] 260 [...] Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes [...] Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake [...] I am--this chiefly, that my way must lie [...] Through many a hard assay, even to the death, [...] Ere I the promised kingdom can attain, [...] Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins' [...] Full weight must be transferred upon my head. [...] Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed, [...] The time prefixed I waited; when behold [...] The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard, [...] 270 [...] Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come [...] Before Messiah, and his way prepare! [...] I, as all others, to his baptism came, [...] Which I believed was from above; but he [...] Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed [...] Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)-- [...] Me him whose harbinger he was; and first [...] Refused on me his baptism to confer, [...] As much his greater, and was hardly won. [...] But, as I rose out of the laving stream, [...] 280 [...] Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence [...] The Spirit descended on me like a Dove; [...] And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice, [...] Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his, [...] Me his beloved Son, in whom alone [...] He was well pleased: by which I knew the time [...] Now full, that I no more should live obscure, [...] But openly begin, as best becomes [...] The authority which I derived from Heaven. [...] And now by some strong motion I am led [...] 290 [...] Into this wilderness; to what intent [...] I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know; [...] For what concerns my knowledge God reveals." [...] So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise, [...] And, looking round, on every side beheld [...] A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades. [...] The way he came, not having marked return, [...] Was difficult, by human steps untrod; [...] And he still on was led, but with such thoughts [...] Accompanied of things past and to come [...] 300 [...] Lodged in his breast as well might recommend [...] Such solitude before choicest society. [...] Full forty days he passed--whether on hill [...] Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night [...] Under the covert of some ancient oak [...] Or cedar to defend him from the dew, [...] Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed; [...] Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt, [...] Till those days ended; hungered then at last [...] Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild, [...] 310 [...] Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk [...] The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm; [...] The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof. [...] But now an aged man in rural weeds, [...] Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye, [...] Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve [...] Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen, [...] To warm him wet returned from field at eve, [...] He saw approach; who first with curious eye [...] Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:-- [...] 320 [...] "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place, [...] So far from path or road of men, who pass [...] In troop or caravan? for single none [...] Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here [...] His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth. [...] I ask the rather, and the more admire, [...] For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late [...] Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford [...] Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son [...] Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes [...] 330 [...] Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth [...] To town or village nigh (nighest is far), [...] Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear, [...] What happens new; fame also finds us out." [...] To whom the Son of God:--"Who brought me hither [...] Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek." [...] "By miracle he may," [...] replied the swain; [...] "What other way I see not; for we here [...] Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured [...] More than the camel, and to drink go far-- [...] 340 [...] Men to much misery and hardship born. [...] But, if thou be the Son of God, command [...] That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; [...] So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve [...] With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste." [...] He ended, and the Son of God replied:-- [...] "Think'st thou such force in bread? Is it not written [...] (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st), [...] Man lives not by bread only, but each word [...] Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed [...] 350 [...] Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount [...] Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank; [...] And forty days Eliah without food [...] Wandered this barren waste; the same I now. [...] Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust [...] Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?" [...] Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:-- [...] "'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate [...] Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt, [...] Kept not my happy station, but was driven [...] 360 [...] With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep-- [...] Yet to that hideous place not so confined [...] By rigour unconniving but that oft, [...] Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy [...] Large liberty to round this globe of Earth, [...] Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens [...] Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. [...] I came, among the Sons of God, when he [...] Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job, [...] To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; [...] 370 [...] And, when to all his Angels he proposed [...] To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud, [...] That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring, [...] I undertook that office, and the tongues [...] Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies [...] To his destruction, as I had in charge: [...] For what he bids I do. Though I have lost [...] Much lustre of my native brightness, lost [...] To be beloved of God, I have not lost [...] To love, at least contemplate and admire, [...] 380 [...] What I see excellent in good, or fair, [...] Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense. [...] What can be then less in me than desire [...] To see thee and approach thee, whom I know [...] Declared the Son of God, to hear attent [...] Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds? [...] Men generally think me much a foe [...] To all mankind. Why should I? they to me [...] Never did wrong or violence. By them [...] I lost not what I lost; rather by them [...] 390 [...] I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell [...] Copartner in these regions of the World, [...] If not disposer--lend them oft my aid, [...] Oft my advice by presages and signs, [...] And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams, [...] Whereby they may direct their future life. [...] Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain [...] Companions of my misery and woe! [...] At first it may be; but, long since with woe [...] Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof [...] 400 [...] That fellowship in pain divides not smart, [...] Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load; [...] Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined. [...] This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man, [...] Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more." [...] To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:-- [...] "Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies [...] From the beginning, and in lies wilt end, [...] Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come [...] Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com'st, indeed, [...] 410 [...] As a poor miserable captive thrall [...] Comes to the place where he before had sat [...] Among the prime in splendour, now deposed, [...] Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned, [...] A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn, [...] To all the host of Heaven. The happy place [...] Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy-- [...] Rather inflames thy torment, representing [...] Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable; [...] So never more in Hell than when in Heaven. [...] 420 [...] But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King! [...] Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear [...] Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? [...] What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem [...] Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him [...] With all inflictions? but his patience won. [...] The other service was thy chosen task, [...] To be a liar in four hundred mouths; [...] For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. [...] Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles [...] 430 [...] By thee are given, and what confessed more true [...] Among the nations? That hath been thy craft, [...] By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies. [...] But what have been thy answers? what but dark, [...] Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding, [...] Which they who asked have seldom understood, [...] And, not well understood, as good not known? [...] Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine, [...] Returned the wiser, or the more instruct [...] To fly or follow what concerned him most, [...] 440 [...] And run not sooner to his fatal snare? [...] For God hath justly given the nations up [...] To thy delusions; justly, since they fell [...] Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is [...] Among them to declare his providence, [...] To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, [...] But from him, or his Angels president [...] In every province, who, themselves disdaining [...] To approach thy temples, give thee in command [...] What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say [...] 450 [...] To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear, [...] Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st; [...] Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold. [...] But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched; [...] No more shalt thou by oracling abuse [...] The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased, [...] And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice [...] Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere-- [...] At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. [...] God hath now sent his living Oracle [...] 460 [...] Into the world to teach his final will, [...] And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell [...] In pious hearts, an inward oracle [...] To all truth requisite for men to know." [...] So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, [...] Though inly stung with anger and disdain, [...] Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:-- [...] "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, [...] And urged me hard with doings which not will, [...] But misery, hath wrested from me. Where [...] 470 [...] Easily canst thou find one miserable, [...] And not inforced oft-times to part from truth, [...] If it may stand him more in stead to lie, [...] Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? [...] But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord; [...] From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure [...] Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. [...] Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, [...] Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear, [...] And tunable as sylvan pipe or song; [...] 480 [...] What wonder, then, if I delight to hear [...] Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire [...] Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me [...] To hear thee when I come (since no man comes), [...] And talk at least, though I despair to attain. [...] Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure, [...] Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest [...] To tread his sacred courts, and minister [...] About his altar, handling holy things, [...] Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice [...] 490 [...] To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet [...] Inspired: disdain not such access to me." [...] To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:-- [...] "Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, [...] I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find'st [...] Permission from above; thou canst not more." [...] He added not; and Satan, bowling low [...] His gray dissimulation, disappeared, [...] Into thin air diffused: for now began [...] Night with her sullen wing to double-shade [...] 500 [...] The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched; [...] And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.|$|E

[...] Therefore as those young Prophets then with care [...] Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these [...] Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico [...] 20 [...] The City of Palms, Aenon, and Salem Old, [...] Machaerus and each Town or City wall'd [...] On this side the broad lake Genezaret [...] Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. [...] Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: [...] Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play [...] Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, [...] Close in a Cottage low together got [...] Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. [...] Alas from what high hope to what relapse [...] 30 [...] Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld [...] Messiah certainly now come, so long [...] Expected of our Fathers; we have heard [...] His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, [...] Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, [...] The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: [...] Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd [...] Into perplexity and new amaze: [...] For whither is he gone, what accident [...] Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire [...] 40 [...] After appearance, and again prolong [...] Our expectation? God of Israel, [...] Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; [...] Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress [...] Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust [...] They have exalted, and behind them cast [...] All fear of thee, arise and vindicate [...] Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, [...] But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, [...] Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, [...] 50 [...] By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, [...] In publick, and with him we have convers'd; [...] Let us be glad of this, and all our fears [...] Lay on his Providence; he will not fail [...] Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, [...] Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, [...] Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. [...] Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume [...] To find whom at the first they found unsought: [...] But to his Mother Mary, when she saw [...] 60 [...] Others return'd from Baptism, not her Son, [...] Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; [...] Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, [...] Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd [...] Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. [...] O what avails me now that honour high [...] To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute [...] Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; [...] While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, [...] And fears as eminent, above the lot [...] 70 [...] Of other women, by the birth I bore, [...] In such a season born when scarce a Shed [...] Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me [...] From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, [...] A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye [...] Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King [...] Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd [...] With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; [...] From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth [...] Hath been our dwelling many years, his life [...] 80 [...] Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, [...] Little suspicious to any King; but now [...] Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, [...] By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, [...] Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; [...] I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, [...] But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold, [...] That to the fall and rising he should be [...] Of Many in Israel, and to a sign [...] Spoken against, that through my very Soul [...] 90 [...] A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, [...] My Exaltation to Afflictions high; [...] Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; [...] I will not argue that, nor will repine. [...] But where delays he now? some great intent [...] Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, [...] I lost him, but so found, as well I saw [...] He could not lose himself; but went about [...] His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, [...] Since understand; much more his absence now [...] 100 [...] Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. [...] But I to wait with patience am inur'd; [...] My heart hath been a store-house long of things [...] And sayings laid up, portending strange events. [...] Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind [...] Recalling what remarkably had pass'd [...] Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts [...] Meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: [...] The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, [...] Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, [...] 110 [...] Into himself descended, and at once [...] All his great work to come before him set; [...] How to begin, how to accomplish best [...] His end of being on Earth, and mission high: [...] For Satan with slye preface to return [...] Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon [...] Up to the middle Region of thick Air, [...] Where all his Potentates in Council sate; [...] There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, [...] Sollicitous and blank he thus began. [...] 120 [...] Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Aethereal Thrones, [...] Demonian Spirits now, from the Element [...] Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, [...] Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, [...] So may we hold our place and these mild seats [...] Without new trouble; such an Enemy [...] Is ris'n to invade us, who no less [...] Threat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell; [...] I, as I undertook, and with the vote [...] Consenting in full <b>frequence</b> was impowr'd, [...] 130 [...] Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find [...] Far other labour to be undergon [...] Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, [...] Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, [...] However to this Man inferior far, [...] If he be Man by Mothers side at least, [...] With more then humane gifts from Heav'n adorn'd, [...] Perfections absolute, Graces divine, [...] And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. [...] Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence [...] 140 [...] Of my success with Eve in Paradise [...] Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure [...] Of like succeeding here; I summon all [...] Rather to be in readiness, with hand [...] Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst [...] Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd. [...] So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all [...] With clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid [...] At his command; when from amidst them rose [...] Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell [...] 150 [...] The sensuallest, and after Asmodai [...] The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd. [...] Set women in his eye and in his walk, [...] Among daughters of men the fairest found; [...] Many are in each Region passing fair [...] As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses [...] Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, [...] Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues [...] Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild [...] And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, [...] 160 [...] Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw [...] Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. [...] Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame [...] Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, [...] Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, [...] Draw out with credulous desire, and lead [...] At will the manliest, resolutest brest, [...] As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. [...] Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart [...] Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, [...] 170 [...] And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. [...] To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd [...] Belial in much uneven scale thou weigh'st [...] All others by thy self; because of old [...] Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring [...] Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, [...] None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. [...] Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, [...] False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth [...] Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, [...] 180 [...] And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. [...] Have we not seen, or by relation heard, [...] In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, [...] In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, [...] In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay [...] Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, [...] Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, [...] Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more [...] Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, [...] Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, [...] 190 [...] Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan? But these haunts [...] Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, [...] How many have with a smile made small account [...] Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd [...] All her assaults, on worthier things intent? [...] Remember that Pellean Conquerour, [...] A youth, how all the Beauties of the East [...] He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; [...] How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd [...] In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. [...] 200 [...] For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full [...] Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond [...] Higher design then to enjoy his State; [...] Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; [...] But he whom we attempt is wiser far [...] Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, [...] Made and set wholly on the accomplishment [...] Of greatest things; what woman will you find, [...] Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, [...] On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye [...] 210 [...] Of fond desire? or should she confident, [...] As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, [...] Descend with all her winning charms begirt [...] To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once [...] Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; [...] How would one look from his Majestick brow [...] Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, [...] Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout [...] All her array; her female pride deject, [...] Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands [...] 220 [...] In the admiration only of weak minds [...] Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Flumes [...] Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, [...] At every sudden slighting quite abasht: [...] Therefore with manlier objects we must try [...] His constancy, with such as have more shew [...] Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; [...] Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; [...] Or that which only seems to satisfie [...] Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; [...] 230 [...] And now I know he hungers where no food [...] Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; [...] The rest commit to me, I shall let pass [...] No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. [...] He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; [...] Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band [...] Of Spirits likest to himself in guile [...] To be at hand, and at his beck appear, [...] If cause were to unfold some active Scene [...] Of various persons each to know his part; [...] 240 [...] Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; [...] Where still from shade to shade the Son of God [...] After forty days fasting had remain'd, [...] Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. [...] Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd [...] Wandring this woody maze, and humane food [...] Nor tasted, nor had appetite: that Fast [...] To Vertue I impute not, or count part [...] Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, [...] Or God support Nature without repast [...] 250 [...] Though needing, what praise is it to endure? [...] But now I feel I hunger, which declares, [...] Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God [...] Can satisfie that need some other way, [...] Though hunger still remain: so it remain [...] Without this bodies wasting, I content me, [...] And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, [...] Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed [...] Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. [...] It was the hour of night, when thus the Son [...] 260 [...] Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down [...] Under the hospitable covert nigh [...] Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, [...] And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, [...] Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; [...] Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood [...] And saw the Ravens with thir horny beaks [...] Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, [...] Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: [...] He saw the Prophet also how he fled [...] 270 [...] Into the Desert, and how there he slept [...] Under a Juniper; then how awakt, [...] He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, [...] And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, [...] And eat the second time after repose, [...] The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; [...] Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, [...] Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. [...] Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark [...] Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry [...] 280 [...] The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: [...] As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose [...] Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, [...] Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. [...] Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, [...] From whose high top to ken the prospect round, [...] If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; [...] But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, [...] Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, [...] With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; [...] 290 [...] Thither he bent his way, determin'd there [...] To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade [...] High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown [...] That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, [...] Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) [...] And to a Superstitious eye the haunt [...] Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, [...] When suddenly a man before him stood, [...] Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, [...] As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, [...] 300 [...] And with fair speech these words to him address'd. [...] With granted leave officious I return, [...] But much more wonder that the Son of God [...] In this wild solitude so long should bide [...] Of all things destitute, and well I know, [...] Not without hunger. Others of some note, [...] As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; [...] The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son [...] Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief [...] By a providing Angel; all the race [...] 310 [...] Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God [...] Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold [...] Native of Thebes wandring here was fed [...] Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. [...] Of thee these forty days none hath regard, [...] Forty and more deserted here indeed. [...] To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? [...] They all had need, I as thou seest have none. [...] How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, [...] Tell me if Food were now before thee set, [...] 320 [...] Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like [...] The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that [...] Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, [...] Hast thou not right to all Created things, [...] Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee [...] Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, [...] But tender all their power? nor mention I [...] Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first [...] To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; [...] Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who [...] 330 [...] Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold [...] Nature asham'd, or better to express, [...] Troubl'd that thou should'st hunger, hath purvey'd [...] From all the Elements her choicest store [...] To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord [...] With honour, only deign to sit and eat. [...] He spake no dream, for as his words had end, [...] Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld [...] In ample space under the broadest shade [...] A Table richly spred, in regal mode, [...] 340 [...] With dishes pil'd, and meats of noblest sort [...] And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, [...] In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, [...] Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, [...] Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, [...] And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd [...] Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. [...] Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, [...] Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! [...] And at a stately side-board by the wine [...] 350 [...] That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood [...] Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew [...] Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more [...] Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood [...] Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades [...] With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, [...] And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd [...] Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since [...] Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide [...] By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, [...] 360 [...] Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, [...] And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard [...] Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds [...] Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd [...] From their soft wings, and flora's earliest smells. [...] Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now [...] His invitation earnestly renew'd. [...] What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? [...] These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict [...] Defends the touching of these viands pure, [...] 370 [...] Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, [...] But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, [...] Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. [...] All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, [...] Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay [...] Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: [...] What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. [...] To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: [...] Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? [...] And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? [...] 380 [...] Shall I receive by gift what of my own, [...] When and where likes me best, I can command? [...] I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, [...] Command a Table in this Wilderness, [...] And call swift flights of Angels ministrant [...] Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: [...] Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, [...] In vain, where no acceptance it can find, [...] And with my hunger what hast thou to do? [...] Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, [...] 390 [...] And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. [...] To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: [...] That I have also power to give thou seest, [...] If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary [...] What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd. [...] And rather opportunely in this place [...] Chose to impart to thy apparent need, [...] Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see [...] What I can do or offer is suspect; [...] Of these things others quickly will dispose [...] 400 [...] Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that [...] Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite [...] With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; [...] Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, [...] And with these words his temptation pursu'd. [...] By hunger, that each other Creature tames, [...] Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; [...] Thy temperance invincible besides, [...] For no allurement yields to appetite, [...] And all thy heart is set on high designs, [...] 410 [...] High actions: but wherewith to be atchiev'd? [...] Great acts require great means of enterprise, [...] Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, [...] A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self [...] Bred up in poverty and streights at home; [...] Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: [...] Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire [...] To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, [...] What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, [...] Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, [...] 420 [...] Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? [...] Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; [...] What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, [...] And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; [...] (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? [...] Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, [...] Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, [...] Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, [...] Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; [...] They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, [...] 430 [...] While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. [...] To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; [...] Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, [...] To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. [...] Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, [...] In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: [...] But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd [...] In lowest poverty to highest deeds; [...] Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, [...] Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat [...] 440 [...] So many Ages, and shall yet regain [...] That seat, and reign in Israel without end. [...] Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World [...] To me is not unknown what hath been done [...] Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember [...] Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? [...] For I esteem those names of men so poor [...] Who could do mighty things, and could contemn [...] Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. [...] And what in me seems wanting, but that I [...] 450 [...] May also in this poverty as soon [...] Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? [...] Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools [...] The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt [...] To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, [...] Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. [...] What if with like aversion I reject [...] Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, [...] Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, [...] Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights [...] 460 [...] To him who wears the Regal Diadem, [...] When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; [...] For therein stands the office of a King, [...] His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, [...] That for the Publick all this weight he bears. [...] Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules [...] Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; [...] Which every wise and vertuous man attains: [...] And who attains not, ill aspires to rule [...] Cities of men, or head-strong Multitudes, [...] 470 [...] Subject himself to Anarchy within, [...] Or lawless passions in him which he serves. [...] But to guide Nations in the way of truth [...] By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead [...] To know, and knowing worship God aright, [...] Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, [...] Governs the inner man, the nobler part, [...] That other o're the body only reigns, [...] And oft by force, which to a generous mind [...] So reigning can be no sincere delight. [...] 480 [...] Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought [...] Greater and nobler done, and to lay down [...] Far more magnanimous, then to assume. [...] Riches are needless then, both for themselves, [...] And for thy reason why they should be sought, [...] To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.|$|E
6000|$|MEANWHILE the new-baptized, who yet {{remained}} [...] At Jordan {{with the}} Baptist, {{and had seen}} [...] Him whom they heard so late expressly called [...] Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared, [...] And on that high authority had believed, [...] And with him talked, and with him lodged--I mean [...] Andrew and Simon, famous after known, [...] With others, though in Holy Writ not named-- [...] Now missing him, their joy so lately found, [...] So lately found and so abruptly gone, [...] 10 [...] Began to doubt, and doubted many days, [...] And, as the days increased, increased their doubt. [...] Sometimes they {{thought he might be}} only shewn, [...] And for a time caught up to God, as once [...] Moses was in the Mount and missing long, [...] And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels [...] Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. [...] Therefore, as those young prophets then with care [...] Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these [...] Nigh to Bethabara--in Jericho [...] 20 [...] The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old, [...] Machaerus, and each town or city walled [...] On this side the broad lake Genezaret, [...] Or in Peraea--but returned in vain. [...] Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek, [...] Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play, [...] Plain fishermen (no greater men them call), [...] Close in a cottage low together got, [...] Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:-- [...] "Alas, from what high hope to what relapse [...] 30 [...] Unlooked for are we fallen! Our eyes beheld [...] Messiah certainly now come, so long [...] Expected of our fathers; we have heard [...] His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth. [...] 'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand; [...] The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:' [...] Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned [...] Into perplexity and new amaze. [...] For whither is he gone? what accident [...] Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire [...] 40 [...] After appearance, and again prolong [...] Our expectation? God of Israel, [...] Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come. [...] Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress [...] Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust [...] They have exalted, and behind them cast [...] All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate [...] Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke! [...] But let us wait; thus far He hath performed-- [...] Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him [...] 50 [...] By his great Prophet pointed at and shown [...] In public, and with him we have conversed. [...] Let us be glad of this, and all our fears [...] Lay on his providence; He will not fail, [...] Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall-- [...] Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence: [...] Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return." [...] Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume [...] To find whom at the first they found unsought. [...] But to his mother Mary, when she saw [...] 60 [...] Others returned from baptism, not her Son, [...] Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none, [...] Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure, [...] Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised [...] Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:-- [...] "Oh, what avails me now that honour high, [...] To have conceived of God, or that salute, [...] 'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!' [...] While I to sorrows am no less advanced, [...] And fears as eminent above the lot [...] 70 [...] Of other women, by the birth I bore: [...] In such a season born, when scarce a shed [...] Could be obtained to shelter him or me [...] From the bleak air? A stable was our warmth, [...] A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly [...] Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king [...] Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled [...] With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem. [...] From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth [...] Hath been our dwelling many years; his life [...] 80 [...] Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, [...] Little suspicious to any king. But now, [...] Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear, [...] By John the Baptist, and in public shewn, [...] Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice, [...] I looked for some great change. To honour? no; [...] But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold, [...] That to the fall and rising he should be [...] Of many in Israel, and to a sign [...] Spoken against--that through my very soul [...] 90 [...] A sword shall pierce. This is my favoured lot, [...] My exaltation to afflictions high! [...] Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest! [...] I will not argue that, nor will repine. [...] But where delays he now? Some great intent [...] Conceals him. When twelve years he scarce had seen, [...] I lost him, but so found as well I saw [...] He could not lose himself, but went about [...] His Father's business. What he meant I mused-- [...] Since understand; much more his absence now [...] 100 [...] Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. [...] But I to wait with patience am inured; [...] My heart hath been a storehouse long of things [...] And sayings laid up, pretending strange events." [...] Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind [...] Recalling what remarkably had passed [...] Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts [...] Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling: [...] The while her Son, tracing the desert wild, [...] Sole, but with holiest meditations fed, [...] 110 [...] Into himself descended, and at once [...] All his great work to come before him set-- [...] How to begin, how to accomplish best [...] His end of being on Earth, and mission high. [...] For Satan, with sly preface to return, [...] Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone [...] Up to the middle region of thick air, [...] Where all his Potentates in council sate. [...] There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy, [...] Solicitous and blank, he thus began:-- [...] 120 [...] "Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones-- [...] Daemonian Spirits now, from the element [...] Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called [...] Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath [...] (So may we hold our place and these mild seats [...] Without new trouble!)--such an enemy [...] Is risen to invade us, who no less [...] Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell. [...] I, as I undertook, and with the vote [...] Consenting in full <b>frequence</b> was impowered, [...] 130 [...] Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find [...] Far other labour to be undergone [...] Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men, [...] Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell, [...] However to this Man inferior far-- [...] If he be Man by mother's side, at least [...] With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned, [...] Perfections absolute, graces divine, [...] And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds. [...] Therefore I am returned, lest confidence [...] 140 [...] Of my success with Eve in Paradise [...] Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure [...] Of like succeeding here. I summon all [...] Rather to be in readiness with hand [...] Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst [...] Thought none my equal, now be overmatched." [...] So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all [...] With clamour was assured their utmost aid [...] At his command; when from amidst them rose [...] Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell, [...] 150 [...] The sensualest, and, after Asmodai, [...] The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:-- [...] "Set women in his eye and in his walk, [...] Among daughters of men the fairest found. [...] Many are in each region passing fair [...] As the noon sky, more like to goddesses [...] Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet, [...] Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues [...] Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild [...] And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach, [...] 160 [...] Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw [...] Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets. [...] Such object hath the power to soften and tame [...] Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, [...] Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, [...] Draw out with credulous desire, and lead [...] At will the manliest, resolutest breast, [...] As the magnetic hardest iron draws. [...] Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart [...] Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, [...] 170 [...] And made him bow, to the gods of his wives." [...] To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:-- [...] "Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st [...] All others by thyself. Because of old [...] Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring [...] Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace, [...] None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. [...] Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew, [...] False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth, [...] Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, [...] 180 [...] And coupled with them, and begot a race. [...] Have we not seen, or by relation heard, [...] In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, [...] In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side, [...] In valley or green meadow, to waylay [...] Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, [...] Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, [...] Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more [...] Too long--then lay'st thy scapes on names adored, [...] Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, [...] 190 [...] Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan? But these haunts [...] Delight not all. Among the sons of men [...] How many have with a smile made small account [...] Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned [...] All her assaults, on worthier things intent! [...] Remember that Pellean conqueror, [...] A youth, how all the beauties of the East [...] He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed; [...] How he surnamed of Africa dismissed, [...] In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid. [...] 200 [...] For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full [...] Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond [...] Higher design than to enjoy his state; [...] Thence to the bait of women lay exposed. [...] But he whom we attempt is wiser far [...] Than Solomon, of more exalted mind, [...] Made and set wholly on the accomplishment [...] Of greatest things. What woman will you find, [...] Though of this age the wonder and the fame, [...] On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye [...] 210 [...] Of fond desire? Or should she, confident, [...] As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne, [...] Descend with all her winning charms begirt [...] To enamour, as the zone of Venus once [...] Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell), [...] How would one look from his majestic brow, [...] Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill, [...] Discountenance her despised, and put to rout [...] All her array, her female pride deject, [...] Or turn to reverent awe! For Beauty stands [...] 220 [...] In the admiration only of weak minds [...] Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes [...] Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy, [...] At every sudden slighting quite abashed. [...] Therefore with manlier objects we must try [...] His constancy--with such as have more shew [...] Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise [...] (Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked); [...] Or that which only seems to satisfy [...] Lawful desires of nature, not beyond. [...] 230 [...] And now I know he hungers, where no food [...] Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness: [...] The rest commit to me; I shall let pass [...] No advantage, and his strength as oft assay." [...] He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim; [...] Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band [...] Of Spirits likest to himself in guile, [...] To be at hand and at his beck appear, [...] If cause were to unfold some active scene [...] Of various persons, each to know his part; [...] 240 [...] Then to the desert takes with these his flight, [...] Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God, [...] After forty days' fasting, had remained, [...] Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:-- [...] "Where will this end? Four times ten days I have passed [...] Wandering this woody maze, and human food [...] Nor tasted, nor had appetite. That fast [...] To virtue I impute not, or count part [...] Of what I suffer here. If nature need not, [...] Or God support nature without repast, [...] 250 [...] Though needing, what praise is it to endure? [...] But now I feel I hunger; which declares [...] Nature hath need of what she asks. Yet God [...] Can satisfy that need some other way, [...] Though hunger still remain. So it remain [...] Without this body's wasting, I content me, [...] And from the sting of famine fear no harm; [...] Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed [...] Me hungering more to do my Father's will." [...] It was the hour of night, when thus the Son [...] 260 [...] Communed in silent walk, then laid him down [...] Under the hospitable covert nigh [...] Of trees thick interwoven. There he slept, [...] And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream, [...] Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet. [...] Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood, [...] And saw the ravens with their horny beaks [...] Food to Elijah bringing even and morn-- [...] Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought; [...] He saw the Prophet also, how he fled [...] 270 [...] Into the desert, and how there he slept [...] Under a juniper--then how, awaked, [...] He found his supper on the coals prepared, [...] And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, [...] And eat the second time after repose, [...] The strength whereof sufficed him forty days: [...] Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, [...] Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. [...] Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark [...] Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry [...] 280 [...] The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song. [...] As lightly from his grassy couch up rose [...] Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream; [...] Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked. [...] Up to a hill anon his steps he reared, [...] From whose high top to ken the prospect round, [...] If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd; [...] But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw-- [...] Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove, [...] With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud. [...] 290 [...] Thither he bent his way, determined there [...] To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade [...] High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown, [...] That opened in the midst a woody scene; [...] Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art), [...] And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt [...] Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs. He viewed it round; [...] When suddenly a man before him stood, [...] Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, [...] As one in city or court or palace bred, [...] 300 [...] And with fair speech these words to him addressed:-- [...] "With granted leave officious I return, [...] But much more wonder that the Son of God [...] In this wild solitude so long should bide, [...] Of all things destitute, and, well I know, [...] Not without hunger. Others of some note, [...] As story tells, have trod this wilderness: [...] The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son, [...] Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief [...] By a providing Angel; all the race [...] 310 [...] Of Israel here had famished, had not God [...] Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold, [...] Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed [...] Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. [...] Of thee those forty days none hath regard, [...] Forty and more deserted here indeed." [...] To whom thus Jesus:--"What conclud'st thou hence? [...] They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none." [...] "How hast thou hunger then?" [...] Satan replied. [...] "Tell me, if food were now before thee set, [...] 320 [...] Wouldst thou not eat?" [...] "Thereafter as I like [...] the giver," [...] answered Jesus. [...] "Why should that [...] Cause thy refusal?" [...] said the subtle Fiend. [...] "Hast thou not right to all created things? [...] Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee [...] Duty and service, nor to stay till bid, [...] But tender all their power? Nor mention I [...] Meats by the law unclean, or offered first [...] To idols--those young Daniel could refuse; [...] Nor proffered by an enemy--though who [...] 330 [...] Would scruple that, with want oppressed? Behold, [...] Nature ashamed, or, better to express, [...] Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed [...] From all the elements her choicest store, [...] To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord [...] With honour. Only deign to sit and eat." [...] He spake no dream; for, as his words had end, [...] Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld, [...] In ample space under the broadest shade, [...] A table richly spread in regal mode, [...] 340 [...] With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort [...] And savour--beasts of chase, or fowl of game, [...] In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled, [...] Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore, [...] Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin, [...] And exquisitest name, for which was drained [...] Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast. [...] Alas! how simple, to these cates compared, [...] Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! [...] And at a stately sideboard, by the wine, [...] 350 [...] That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood [...] Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue [...] Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more, [...] Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood, [...] Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades [...] With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, [...] And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed [...] Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since [...] Of faery damsels met in forest wide [...] By knights of Logres, or of Lyones, [...] 360 [...] Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore. [...] And all the while harmonious airs were heard [...] Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds [...] Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned [...] From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. [...] Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now [...] His invitation earnestly renewed:-- [...] "What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?

[...] All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs, [...] Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay [...] Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord. [...] What doubt'st thou, Son of God? Sit down and eat." [...] To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:-- [...] "Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? [...] And who withholds my power that right to use? [...] 380 [...] Shall I receive by gift what of my own, [...] When and where likes me best, I can command? [...] I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, [...] Command a table in this wilderness, [...] And call swift flights of Angels ministrant, [...] Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend: [...] Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence [...] In vain, where no acceptance it can find? [...] And with my hunger what hast thou to do? [...] Thy pompous delicacies I contemn, [...] 390 [...] And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles." [...] To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:-- [...] "That I have also power to give thou seest; [...] If of that power I bring thee voluntary [...] What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased, [...] And rather opportunely in this place [...] Chose to impart to thy apparent need, [...] Why shouldst thou not accept it? But I see [...] What I can do or offer is suspect. [...] Of these things others quickly will dispose, [...] 400 [...] Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil." [...] With that [...] Both table and provision vanished quite, [...] With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard; [...] Only the importune Tempter still remained, [...] And with these words his temptation pursued:-- [...] "By hunger, that each other creature tames, [...] Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved; [...] Thy temperance, invincible besides, [...] For no allurement yields to appetite; [...] And all thy heart is set on high designs, [...] 410 [...] High actions. But wherewith to be achieved? [...] Great acts require great means of enterprise; [...] Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, [...] A carpenter thy father known, thyself [...] Bred up in poverty and straits at home, [...] Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit. [...] Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire [...] To greatness? whence authority deriv'st? [...] What followers, what retinue canst thou gain, [...] Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude, [...] 420 [...] Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost? [...] Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms. [...] What raised Antipater the Edomite, [...] And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne, [...] Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends? [...] Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, [...] Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap-- [...] Not difficult, if thou hearken to me. [...] Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand; [...] They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, [...] 430 [...] While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want." [...] To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:-- [...] "Yet wealth without these three is impotent [...] To gain dominion, or to keep it gained-- [...] Witness those ancient empires of the earth, [...] In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved; [...] But men endued with these have oft attained, [...] In lowest poverty, to highest deeds-- [...] Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad [...] Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate [...] 440 [...] So many ages, and shall yet regain [...] That seat, and reign in Israel without end. [...] Among the Heathen (for throughout the world [...] To me is not unknown what hath been done [...] Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember [...] Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? [...] For I esteem those names of men so poor, [...] Who could do mighty things, and could contemn [...] Riches, though offered from the hand of kings. [...] And what in me seems wanting but that I [...] 450 [...] May also in this poverty as soon [...] Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? [...] Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools, [...] The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt [...] To slacken virtue and abate her edge [...] Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise. [...] What if with like aversion I reject [...] Riches and realms! Yet not for that a crown, [...] Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, [...] Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights, [...] 460 [...] To him who wears the regal diadem, [...] When on his shoulders each man's burden lies; [...] For therein stands the office of a king, [...] His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise, [...] That for the public all this weight he bears. [...] Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules [...] Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king-- [...] Which every wise and virtuous man attains; [...] And who attains not, ill aspires to rule [...] Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes, [...] 470 [...] Subject himself to anarchy within, [...] Or lawless passions in him, which he serves. [...] But to guide nations in the way of truth [...] By saving doctrine, and from error lead [...] To know, and, knowing, worship God aright, [...] Is yet more kingly. This attracts the soul, [...] Governs the inner man, the nobler part; [...] That other o'er the body only reigns, [...] And oft by force--which to a generous mind [...] So reigning can be no sincere delight. [...] 480 [...] Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought [...] Greater and nobler done, and to lay down [...] Far more magnanimous, than to assume. [...] Riches are needless, then, both for themselves, [...] And for thy reason why they should be sought-- [...] To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed." ...|$|E
