40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method for {{computing}} approximate <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances.</b> We introduce the wave method for approximating <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> from a point on a manifold mesh. Our method involves the solution of two linear systems of equations. One system of equations is solved repeatedly to propagate the wave on the entire mesh, and one system is solved once after wave propagation is complete in order to compute the approximate <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> up to an additive constant. However, these systems need to be pre-factored only once, and can be solved efficiently at each iteration. All of our tests required approximately between 300 and 400 iterations, which were completed in a few seconds. Therefore, this method can approximate <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> quickly, and the approximation is highly accurate. Comment: 10 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

For an ε-sample S, the algorithm has a near-optimal running time of O (|S | 2 log |S |), an optimal space requirement of O (|S | 2), and approximates the <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> up to a factor of 1 − O (√ ε) and (1 − O (ε)) − 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Isometric {{surfaces}} {{share the}} same geometric structure {{also known as the}} `first fundamental form'. For example, all possible bending of a given surface, that include all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface, are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant canonical form for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the intrinsic geodesic structure of the surface in a finite dimensional Euclidean space, in which <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> are approximated by Euclidean ones. The canonical representation is constructed by first measuring the inter <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> between points on the surfaces. Next, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques are applied to extract a finite dimensional flat space in which <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> are represented as Euclidean ones. The <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> are measured by the efficient `fast marching on triangulated domains' numerical algorithm. Applying this transform to various objects with similar geodesic structures (similar first fundamental form) maps isometric objects into similar canonical forms.

50|$|Isomap is one {{representative}} of isometric mapping methods, and extends metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) by incorporating the geodesic distances imposed by a weighted graph. To be specific, the classical scaling of metric MDS performs low-dimensional embedding {{based on the}} pairwise distance between data points, which is generally measured using straight-line Euclidean distance. Isomap is distinguished by its use of the <b>geodesic</b> <b>distance</b> induced by a neighborhood graph embedded in the classical scaling. This is done to incorporate manifold structure in the resulting embedding. Isomap defines the <b>geodesic</b> <b>distance</b> to be the sum of edge weights along the shortest path between two nodes (computed using Dijkstra's algorithm, for example).

40|$|Abstract. Correspondence between non-rigid {{deformable}} 3 D objects {{provides a}} foundation for object matching and retrieval, recognition, and 3 D alignment. Establishing 3 D correspondence is challenging when there are non-rigid deformations or articulations between instances of a class. We present a method for automatically finding such correspondences that deals with significant variations in pose, shape and resolution between pairs of objects. We represent objects as triangular meshes and consider normalized <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> as representing their intrinsic characteristics. <b>Geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> are invariant to pose variations and nearly invariant to shape variations when properly normalized. The proposed method registers two objects by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over a subset of vertex pairs between the objects. The model enforces preservation of <b>geodesic</b> <b>distances</b> between corresponding vertex pairs and inference is performed using loopy belief propagation in a hierarchical scheme. Additionally our method prefers solutions in which local shape information is consistent at matching vertices. We quantitatively evaluate our method and show that is is more accurate than {{a state of the}} art method. ...|$|R
