40|$|Refers to Revised Draft, December 9, 2005] The social {{psychology}} literature on justice {{suggests that the}} perception of injustice produces the strongest human emotional response. Perceptions of injustice can lead to conflicts over the justice of social outcomes, threatening social cohesion and security. Trade law, and globalization more generally, are increasingly perceived as unjust {{with respect to the}} interests of developing countries and of the poor in all countries. To the extent that the various stakeholders in globalization perceive a lack of reciprocity between their investment and their return, they will naturally address their claims of injustice towards the global trading system, with adverse consequences <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> <b>law</b> and for global security more generally. In order <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> <b>law</b> to contribute to increased security, it must produce outcomes that increase participants’ sense of the justice of global economic relations. For this to occur, the global trading system must consider the distribution of gains from trade within domestic societies. Whether or not the gains from trade, and globalization more generally, are perceived to be justly distributed within a society will directly influence participants’ views of the justice of the trading system as a whole. Trade law has an important role to play in addressing this perceived dislocation of risk and return, {{in much the same way}} that corporate law does so in domestic societies, through strategies which address both perceptions of economic injustice and potential underlying contributing factors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purchase}} of a product or service by a consumer directly abroad and the remote consumption of goods are the two main ways in which transnational consumption occurs. This new contractual dynamic – {{a direct result of}} the development of transport and communication facilities- has consequences not only for consumer protection but also <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> <b>law.</b> It demands from doctrine, courts and legislators an effort to solve problems arising therefrom. Important lessons can be learned from the application of economic theory to law among the difficulties to fit private international law to constitutional principles. New paradigms proposed by the courts in recent years brought great expectations in the national legal system to the evolution of consumer protection concerning international trade. Theoretical developments are now necessary to elaborate regulatory proposals under trademark and corporate law- with particular attention to financial institutions-so as to grant greater protection to the vulnerable consumer assuring security and predictability to the system, which are essential to the correct operation of the market...|$|E

40|$|The Tenth Circuit {{seems to}} be in a battle with itself over the meaning and {{definition}} of our copyright system. In the last two years, the Tenth Circuit defined the public domain as a constitutionally protected component of the copyright system, and then reversing itself, defined copyright (ignoring the public domain) as a tool for international trade, where treaty obligations outweigh tradition. The Golan case stands at the center of competing priorities and definitions. How are we to understand the "physics" of the public domain within contemporary copyright law? Does copyright have principles and an internal logic to foster creativity, or is copyright to be seen as malleable tool for trade and international relations? Judge Henry in the 2007 Tenth Circuit Golan v. Gonzales stated that under the traditional contours of copyright, what comes into the public domain, stays in the public domain. With this came a First Amendment right to use public domain works, and he remanded the case back to the district court to further determine whether the statute in question required content-based or content-neutral First amendment analysis. This decision marked the first time a part of the copyright law had been found unconstitutional, and it also marked a moment where the public domain appeared to be protected by the U. S. Constitution. Upon appeal from the district court remanded decision, the Tenth Circuit appeals court—albeit with a different chief judge—found the same statute not in violation of the First Amendment, and perfectly in line with the United States' treaty and international obligations. In this opinion, works in the public domain were fair game, particularly because their restoration would somehow help American authors indirectly.

40|$|Who governs {{international}} <b>trade</b> <b>law</b> regimes? Although {{this question}} has attracted much research for global regulatory regimes, {{very little is}} known about international <b>trade</b> <b>law</b> organizations which function as global legislatures.

Based on ten years of fieldwork, extensive interviews, and unique data on delegation attendance and participation in UNCITRAL’s Working Group on Insolvency, the paper positions the empirical question of delegation attributes within broader theories of global norm-making and specifies these with respect to several hypotheses. The data show that the inner core of global trade lawmakers at UNCITRAL represents a tiny and unrepresentative subset of state and non-state actors.

Specifically, it examines how the imported <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> has developed and interacted with different legal, economic, technological, and sociocultural realities in the two Asian countries. Japan and Korea adopted <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> in the early 1990 s. However, trade secret protection did not have a considerable impact in either Japan or Korea at this early stage of implementation because of several factors, including the role of local substitutes <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> and defects in procedural law supporting the substantive <b>trade</b> secret <b>law.</b> On the other hand, the protracted economic recession in Japan after the burst of the economic bubble and the Asian financial crisis in Korea in the late 1990 s created a new business cycle in which <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> has been gaining importance in these societies. The new business cycle has encouraged governments in the two Asian countries to recognize that <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> is an important mechanism for dealing with corporate control of valuable information and the management of human capital in pursuing continuing economic growth and protecting the stature of their countries in the international economy.

40|$|The {{skills and}} {{innovations}} of indigenous and local communities - their so-called “traditional knowledge” - go largely unrecognized by intellectual property law. Meanwhile, patent and copyright laws reward the innovative and creative contributions {{of individuals and}} firms that freely use traditional knowledge as inputs {{for a variety of}} products. The perceived inequity has inspired the ire of indigenous groups, advocates and developing country governments, led to impassioned accusations of “biopiracy” and “First-World imperialism,” and triggered various reform efforts.

40|$|As {{has been}} noted elsewhere, the advent of digital {{technology}} and the Internet has greatly increased the risk that a company’s trade secrets will be lost through the inadvertent or intentional distribution of such secrets. The advent of cloud computing adds another dimension to this risk by placing actual or potential trade secrets {{in the hands of}} a third-party: the cloud computing service. This article explores the legal and practical implications of cloud computing as they relate to trade secret protection. While there are many types of cloud computing services, this article focuses on cloud-based services that offer businesses the ability to upload and store information and data remotely via the Internet (hereinafter “cloud storage services”). The first part of the article discusses the practices of cloud storage services and the current state of <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> in order to identify and explain the risks posed to trade secrets stored in the Cloud. It begins with an overview of the cloud computing industry, including an examination of the terms of service agreements used by cloud storage services. After a brief explanation of the requirements <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> secret protection (with particular emphasis on the reasonable efforts requirement), the article then explains the third-party doctrine of <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> and how that doctrine threatens to waive <b>trade</b> secrecy <b>for</b> information stored in the Cloud. Because the analysis of the relationship between cloud storage services and their customers leads to the conclusion that, at least in the absence of an express or implied-in-fact agreement to the contrary, no duty of confidentiality is established and trade secrecy is likely to be waived, the article ends by exploring potential refinements and exceptions to the third-party doctrine of <b>trade</b> secret <b>law.</b> After concluding that no existing definition of disclosure provides a workable exception to the third-party doctrine of <b>trade</b> secret <b>law,</b> the article ends with a proposal that the law officially recognize an expanded taxonomy <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> that recognizes a distinction between trade secrecy destroying “disclosures” and non-trade secrecy destroying “mere transfers. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Trade</b> secret <b>law</b> arose to help {{companies}} protect {{confidential information}} (e. g., the Coca-Cola formula) from competitors seeking to copy their innovative efforts. But companies increasingly use <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> {{to block a}} wide swath of information from the scrutinizing eyes of consumers, public watchdog groups, and potential improvers. Companies can do this, in part, because <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> lacks clear limiting doctrines that consider the social benefits of unauthorized use. <b>For</b> example, <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> makes no allowance for the departing employee that uses proprietary information to create a substantially improved product or disclose public health risks. This Article argues that <b>trade</b> secret <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 7 s indifference to the social benefits of unauthorized use stands in contrast to other intellectual property doctrines, like patent and copyright.

The linking theme throughout this article is that unfair competition laws achieve optimal levels of accurate information in the market. False advertising and state deceptive <b>trade</b> practices <b>laws</b> are two such laws that should be applied to secure these optimal levels in the market. This article demonstrates why prudential standing measures will ensure proper enforcement of the Lanham Act and state deceptive <b>trade</b> practices <b>laws</b> to promote optimal levels of accurate information in the market.
