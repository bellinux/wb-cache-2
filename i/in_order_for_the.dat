However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
40|$|CuPt-type atomic <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> InAsySb 1 -y layers {{grown by}} {{molecular}} beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on (001) substrates was investigated using TED and TEM. The degree of ordering was greater and occurred at higher temperatures, and the ordered domains were larger, in the MOVPE layers compared with the MBE layers. AFM showed surface ridges along <b>the</b> [110] direction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MOVPE layers and along <b>the</b> [] direction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> M-BE layers.

5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E

50|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{sporting}} regulations, with the rules governing the running order—the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> which crews enter a stage—reverting to the system used in 2014 to address concerns over road sweeping, whereby championship leaders were forced to clear the roads of loose gravel, costing them time and exposing the harder-packed and faster road base for following drivers to take advantage of. Under the reintroduced rules, the crews will enter a stage <b>in</b> championship <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first day of competition, and then <b>in</b> reverse championship <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining legs of the event.|$|R
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E

The city's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> economy and tourism to expand.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tornado {{to perform}} well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011. Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Voeckler was complacent about his team's future, believing his team manager Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor. Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point, but that deadlines were working against him <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, {{protested the}} CIA's {{outsourcing}} of jobs.

The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union {{are scheduled to be}} laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group.

5|$|Operation Freshman was {{the first}} British {{airborne}} operation conducted using gliders, its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Norway, which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany. By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close {{to being able to}} develop a nuclear reactor, but <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of this water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small force from the 1st Airborne Division, comprising 30 sappers from the Royal Engineers, would land by glider a short distance from the plant, and demolish it with explosives.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disk of the Sun/Moon {{to be easily}} visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
