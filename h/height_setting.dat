Sir Hercules had a susceptible heart, and had more than once, {{between the ages of}} sixteen and twenty, felt what it was to love. But here his deformity had been a source of the most bitter humiliation, for, having once dared to declare himself to a young lady of his choice, he had been received with laughter. On his persisting, she had picked him up and shaken him like an importunate child, telling him to run away and plague her no more. The story soon got about--indeed, the young lady herself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdote--and the taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most acute distress to Hercules. From the poems written at this period we gather that he meditated taking his own life. In course of time, however, he lived down this humiliation; but never again, though he often fell in love, and that very passionately, did he dare to make any advances to those in whom he was interested. After coming to the estate and finding that he {{was in a position to}} create his own world as he desired it, he saw that, if he was to have a wife--which he very much desired, being of an affectionate and, indeed, amorous temper--he must choose her as he had chosen his servants--from among the race of dwarfs. But to find a suitable wife was, he found, a matter of some difficulty; for he would marry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth. The dwarfish daughter of Lord Bemboro he refused on the ground that besides being a pigmy she was hunchbacked; while another young lady, an orphan belonging to a very good family in Hampshire, was rejected by him because her face, like that of so many dwarfs, was wizened and repulsive. Finally, when he was almost despairing of success, he heard from a reliable source that Count Titimalo, a Venetian nobleman, possessed a daughter of exquisite beauty and great accomplishments, who was by three feet in <b>height.</b> <b>Setting</b> out at once for Venice, he went immediately on his arrival to pay his respects to the count, whom he found living with his wife and five children in a very mean apartment in one of the poorer quarters of the town. Indeed, the count was so far reduced in his circumstances that he was even then negotiating (so it was rumoured) with a travelling company of clowns and acrobats, who had had the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf, for the sale of his diminutive daughter Filomena. Sir Hercules arrived in time to save her from this untoward fate, for he was so much charmed by Filomena's grace and beauty, that at the end of three days' courtship he made her a formal offer of marriage, which was accepted by her no less joyfully than by her father, who perceived in an English son-in-law a rich and unfailing source of revenue. After an unostentatious marriage, at which the English ambassador acted as one of the witnesses, Sir Hercules and his bride returned by sea to England, where they settled down, as it proved, to a life of uneventful happiness.|$|E

The study was motivated by empirical observations of {{the accuracy of the}} photogrammetry system varying as a function of location within a measurement volume of approximately 100 m 3. Error quantification was implemented through simultaneously tracking a target scanned through a sub-volume (27 m 3) using both systems.

Average errors of 1. 48 mm and 3. 95 mm were obtained for the active and passive calibration artefacts respectively.

40|$|AIMS To {{investigate}} {{the extent and}} timing of diurnal variation in stature and to examine {{the effectiveness of the}} stretched technique in reducing the loss in <b>height.</b> <b>SETTING</b> A Southampton school. DESIGN Fifty three children, divided into two groups, were measured by two independent auxologists using a Leicester height measure. Each child was measured four times, at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500, using both an unstretched and a stretched technique. OUTCOME MEASURES Height loss after each of the three time intervals for both unstretched and stretched modes. RESULTS There was a clear decrease in stature during the morning, but no further loss occurred after the subjects had been up for around six hours. The mean height losses for the unstretched (stretched) modes were 0. 31 cm (0. 34 cm) and 0. 20 cm (0. 23 cm) for the periods 0900 to 1100 and 1100 to 1300, respectively, but only 0. 045 cm (- 0. 019 cm) from 1300 to 1500. Stretching did not reduce the effects of diurnal variation, but significantly affected the recorded height by an average of 0. 28 cm. There {{was no significant difference in}} reproducibility using either technique (SD 0. 30 cm stretched v 0. 31 cm unstretched). CONCLUSIONS Diurnal variation in stature may substantially affect the reliability of height data and careful consideration should be given to the timing of repeat measurements. As most height loss occurs in the morning, afternoon clinic appointments would be preferable. The standard stretched technique does not appear to reduce diurnal variation, nor does it affect precision.

SUBJECTS [...] 5573 children aged 5 - 11 (63. 3 % of eligible children) had respiratory symptoms analysed and 2036 children (67. 1 % of eligible children) had lung function measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, occasional and frequent wheeze, cough {{first thing in the}} morning, and cough at any other time and lung function. RESULTS [...] Birth weight adjusted for gestational age was significantly associated with all lung function measurements, except FEF 25 - 75. The association remained for FVC (b = 0. 475, 95 % confidence interval 0. 181 to 0. 769) and FEV 1 (b = 0. 502, 0. 204 to 0. 800) after adjustment for gestational age, parental smoking, and social factors. FEF 75 - 85 was the only lung function related to gestational age. Respiratory symptoms, especially wheeze most days (adjusted odds ratio 0. 9, 0. 84 to 0. 97) were significantly associated with prematurity. Every extra week of gestation reduced the risk of severe wheeze by about 10 %.

40|$|In mammography, {{the height}} of the image {{receptor}} is adjusted to the patient before compressing the breast. An inadequate <b>height</b> <b>setting</b> can result in an imbalance between the forces applied by the image receptor and the paddle, causing the clamped breast to be pushed up or down relative to the body during compression. This leads to unnecessary stretching of the skin and other tissues around the breast, which can make the imaging procedure more painful for the patient. The goal {{of this study was to}} implement a method to measure and minimize the force imbalance, and to assess its feasibility as an objective and reproducible method of setting the image receptor height. A trial was conducted consisting of 13 craniocaudal mammographic compressions on a silicone breast phantom, each with the image receptor positioned at a different height. The image receptor height was varied over a range of 12 cm. In each compression, the force exerted by the compression paddle was increased up to 140 N in steps of 10 N. In addition to the paddle force, the authors measured the force exerted by the image receptor and the reaction force exerted on the patient body by the ground. The trial was repeated 8 times, with the phantom remounted at a slightly different orientation and position between the trials. For a given paddle force, the obtained results showed that there is always exactly one image receptor height that leads to a balance of the forces on the breast. For the breast phantom, deviating from this specific height increased the force imbalance by 9. 4 ± 1. 9 N/cm (6. 7 %) for 140 N paddle force, and by 7. 1 ± 1. 6 N/cm (17. 8 %) for 40 N paddle force. The results also show that in situations where the force exerted by the image receptor is not measured, the craniocaudal force imbalance can still be determined by positioning the patient on a weighing scale and observing the changes in displayed weight during the procedure. In mammographic breast compression, even small changes in the image receptor height can lead to a severe imbalance of the applied forces. This may make the procedure more painful than necessary and, in case the image receptor is set too low, may lead to image quality issues and increased radiation dose due to undercompression. In practice, these effects can be reduced by monitoring the force imbalance and actively adjusting the position of the image receptor throughout the compressio...|$|E
30|$|Based on this {{experimental}} study, it can {{be concluded}} that warp density and weft density of denim fabric were changed due to change in position of whip roller both in horizontal and vertical way. That’s why areal density was also affected by backrest roller position. Warp way crimp% gradually decreased with increasing height at fixed depth of whip roller both in grey and finished state while it showed vice versa result with increasing depth at fixed height in both state of fabric. The sample made at height position of + 12 and depth 5 showed maximum warp crimp% value of 13.33 and 16.36 in grey and finished state respectively. Weft way crimp% also showed a significant result in finished state. The maximum finished weft crimp% value found at the position of + 16 height and depth 4 was 7.8. The position of whip roller affects grey fabric’s weft way crimp% slightly. Warp way tensile strength tremendously increased with ascending of whip roller position. But after a certain position again it gradually decreased in both state. Warp strength had a similar relation with decreasing depth position of whip roller in fixed height. The maximum warp strength value for grey and finished fabric were 761.77 N and 688.06 N respectively found at height position of + 14 and depth position of 4. No significant effect was found on weft strength, width wise shrinkage and skewness of denim fabric both in grey and finished state due to change in settings of whip roller. Air permeability of denim fabric simultaneously decreased with increasing height of whip roller but after a certain position it started to increase. This trend was found for both (grey and finished) fabric at fixed depth position of whip roller. But air permeability changed in inversely proportional way with variable depth at constant height position of whip roller. The highest value of air permeability (in cm 3 /s/cm 2) for grey and finished denim was found 160.42 and 156.94 respectively at the position of height + 8 and depth 4. Width wise fabric shrinkage gradually increased with increasing height position of whip roller at fixed depth and similarly decreased with decreasing depth of whip roller at fixed <b>height</b> <b>setting</b> but only in case of grey state. The maximum value of shrinkage% was 12.6 at height + 12 and depth 3. In finishing state of fabric, shrinkage% had so negligible value due to different finishing treatment. Generally whip roller setting is kept unchanged in different woven fabric production. But it directly affects EPcm and PPcm which change the cover factor of fabric. Moreover, the research result shows that it also deviates different physical properties of fabric. So if this position is optimized, fabric properties can be enriched as well as faults can be minimized.|$|E

40|$|Resumo: No Brasil, a agroindústria canavieira processa 318 milhões de toneladas de cana-de-açúcar por ano (UNICA, 2003). Atualmente, de 5 a 15 % desta matéria-prima é perdida no campo, quando o corte é feito manual ou mecanizado respectivamente, representando um prejuízo da ordem de US$ 450 milhões por ano. Devido a lei governamental n° 11. 241 de 19 / 09 / 2002, o corte tende a tornar-se apenas de cana crua, sem queimar, inviabilizando o corte manual. Desta forma, as perdas devem permanecer próximas do último valor. Este trabalho parte da hipótese de que é possível desenvolver alternativas tecnológicas, como o aprimoramento dos componentes e sistemas das colhedoras de cana-de-açúcar picada, para minimizar este desperdício. Pretendeu-se, inicialmente, quantificar as perdas impossíveis de serem levantadas diretamente no campo (perdas invisíveis), já que as perdas visíveis são conhecidas, e a incidência de matéria estranha na cana processada pelas colhedoras de cana picada. Mantendo-se as colhedoras sob condições controladas, os ensaios foram realizados em um galpão de manutenção de máquinas da Usina São João/Araras-SP e na oficina de protótipos agrícolas do Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar-CTC, de janeiro/ 1997 a março/ 2000. As colhedoras, que permaneceram estacionárias, foram alimentadas por uma esteira rolante acionada pelo motor hidráulico. Nos ensaios de perdas invisíveis foram utilizadas, inicialmente, canas limpas, desfolhadas e despontadas e depois canas com folhas e pontas. Para a determinação das impurezas vegetais na carga, foram processados colmos integrais, com folhas e ponteiros, simulando a condição adversa de canavial tombado. Por meio da análise dos dados quantificados nos ensaios de cana com palha, concluiu-se que as perdas invisíveis nos sistemas das colhedoras variaram de 2 a 11 %, e são maiores na cana com maior teor de fibra e mais torta e na cana com palha em relação à cana sem palha. A eficiência de limpeza da matéria-prima ficou entre 74 % na base matéria seca, para a velocidade angular de rotação das pás do extrator primário de 1000 rpm e 89 % para a velocidade de 1200 rpm. Os resultados apontaram que o fluxo de massa de cana que alimenta a colhedora não tem influência nas {{magnitudes}} das perdas invisíveis totais de cana e na eficiência de limpeza na matéria-prima. Baseado nos resultados obtidos na primeira fase, na segunda etapa apresentou-se 4 propostas para a regulagem, ajustes e o aperfeiçoamento dos componentes das colhedoras. A primeira proposta foi verificar a possibilidade de utilização de uma mini-câmera para ser instalada junto ao disco de corte de base para auxiliar o operador da colhedora no controle da altura de corte. A segunda proposta avaliada foi a eficiência de um novo mecanismo de controle de altura do corte de base flutuante, capaz de acompanhar as ondulações do terreno. Observou-se, durante as safras 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 e 2001 / 2002, que o mecanismo avaliado é eficiente, robusto e que oferece uma rápida resposta na altura requerida. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de campo, indicam que o corte de base flutuante tem um desempenho melhor que o convencional. Demonstram que o índice de impureza mineral na carga, a quantidade de soqueiras arrancadas e de perdas visíveis no campo são menores quando a colhedora trabalha em cana comercial equipada com o conjunto corte basal flutuante. O trabalho, também, avaliou a possibilidade de se utilizar um material alternativo (ferro fundido branco) para as facas dos rolos picadores em substituição ao padrão aço mola, visando, sem sucesso, aumentar a resistência ao desgaste e ao impacto destas peças. A quarta proposta foi o uso de um monitor de perdas instalado no extrator primário da colhedora. Avaliou-se o desempenho deste monitor trabalhando no campo e quantificando as perdas visíveis de cana e a eficiência de limpeza do extrator primário em relação a variação da rotação do ventilador. Utilizou-se para monitorar as perdas um sensor piezoelétrico que apresentou boa sensibilidade aos impactos contra o capuz do extrator primário. Observou-se também uma boa correlação entre os dados de eficiência de limpeza e perdas com os valores registrados pelo monitor. Assim, o presente trabalho visa reduzir os custos do processamento de cana minimizando as perdas e melhorando o desempenho das colhedoras de cana picada, aumentando a competitividade do setor. Abstract: The Brazilian {{sugar cane}} industry crashes 318 millions tones of sugarcane a year. Nowadays, from 5 to 15 % this raw material {{is lost in}} the field, when the harvesting is done by hand or mecanized respectively, given a damage about US$ 450 millions a year, since only 15 % is mechanical harvested. Due to a environmental government law green cane harvesting will be compulsory, in few years, so the losses must be keeping nearly the last number. The hipotesis for this work {{is that it is}} possible to make use of technologicals alternatives, to improve the components and internals systems to process raw material inside the sugar cane chopped harvesters, to minimize this waste. The purpose of this research was to determine the invisible losses (which are impossible to be located in the field) because the visible losses are already known, and the incidence of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the sugarcane processed by chopper harvesters. Trials carried out under controlled conditions at the maintenance workshop of São João Sugar mill (Araras-SP) and at the agricultural prototypes workshop of Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar (Piracicaba-SP), from January / 1997 till march/ 2000. The harvesters, which stayed stationary, were fed by a conveyor driven by a hydraulic motor. For the tests of invisible losses clean cane whithout leaves, straw and tops was used first, afther that, the wholestalks were processed with leaves and tops, also to determine vegetable impurities in the load, simulating adverse condition of lodged cane crop. The pneumatic cleaning systems velocity, extractors in the harvesters, affected the magnitude of invisible losses and the amount of vegetable impurities in the load. The largest invisible losses in the cane processed by the harvesters occured due to choppers and base cutter waste knives and they were higher at the primary extrator followed by the base cutter in all over the components and internals systems of the harvesters. The harvester had higher invisible losses in cane with leaves than in cane whithout leaves, and they were highest in the hard cane (higher fibre) and lodged and tangled cane. The values of invisible losses and incidence of amount of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the load, due to the different adjustments of pneumatic cleaning systems of the harvesters, are analysed and discussed in this work. Based on the first step data, it intends on the second step to show four proposals to set up, to adjust and to improve the harvester’s components. First of all, this work want to verify to use of a mini camera helping the harvesters’ operators control the base cutter’s height. At the beginning of this research a novel system for controlling base cutter cutting height was designed and manufactured in an attempt to improve the performance of commercial sugarcane chopper harvesters. The system differed from previous attempts to control base cutter height by suspending the base cutter gearbox and associated components as a discrete module incorporating a passive height control system. The advantages offered by this system include the potential for rapid response to cutting height requirements, the elimination of the secondary effects of base cutter height adjustments on topper <b>height</b> <b>setting</b> and, being fully mechanical, the system does not require additional hydraulic or mechanical control. This paper reviews the results of a testing programme undertaken on the floating base cutter system during the 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 harvesting seasons with machines working in commercial cane fields. The results of the trial programme indicated that the mineral trash levels in loads transported from field to mill were consistently lower from machines fitted with the floating base cutter system relative to standard machines. The amounts of butts left in the field, of roots and stools removed from the field were also lower with the floating base cutter, however, under the conditions of the tests, statistical significance was not achieved. At the end, this research want to assess the chopper knives made of alternative material (white cast iron) to minimize the wearing and breaking by impacts, and it checks the Cane Loss Monitor working on primary extractor aimed to reduce raw material losses and improve the cleanliness of the cane load to the mill The proposed work aims to reduce the sugar cane processed costs minimizing the losses and improves to the chopped harvesters performance...|$|E

It is a large multi-winged brick and masonry complex with Late Gothic Revival architecture, five stories in <b>height,</b> <b>set</b> on a large landscaped property behind Trinity Junior High School. The building was designed by Oklahoma City architect F. W. Redlich, and was built in 1923-24. It originally housed living quarters for the convent {{as well as a}} chapel and school; the school closed in 1969, and the academic space is now leased to the Trinity School.|$|R

25|$|Competition, {{especially}} for space, is another dominant interaction structuring intertidal communities. Space competition is especially fierce in rocky intertidal habitats, where habitable space is limited compared to soft-sediment habitats in which three-dimensional space is available. As {{seen with the}} previous sea star example, mussels are competitively dominant {{when they are not}} kept in check by sea star predation. Joseph Connell's research on two types of high intertidal barnacles, Balanus balanoides, now Semibalanus balanoides, and a Chthamalus stellatus, showed that zonation patterns could also be set by competition between closely related organisms. In this example, Balanus outcompetes Chthamalus at lower tide heights but is unable to survive at higher tide heights. Thus, Balanus conforms to the intertidal ecology dogma introduced above: its lower tide <b>height</b> limit is <b>set</b> by a predatory snail and its higher tide <b>height</b> limit is <b>set</b> by climate. Similarly, Chthamalus, which occurs in a refuge from competition (similar to the temperature refuges discussed above), has a lower tide <b>height</b> limit <b>set</b> by competition with Balanus and a higher tide <b>height</b> limit is <b>set</b> by climate.|$|R
30|$|Different {{studies showed}} that changes in saddle height affect neuromuscular {{activation}} during cycling. Sanderson and Amoroso (2009) observed that greater knee flexion (differences of 17 °) due to low saddle height decreased neuromuscular activation in the soleus and medial gastrocnemius. Jorge and Hull (1986) found lower activation of quadriceps and hamstring when saddle <b>height</b> was <b>set</b> at 95  % of trochanteric length compared to saddle <b>height</b> <b>set</b> at 100  %. These differences in the neuromuscular activation can theoretically affect the heat production of the muscles, thus affecting skin temperature (Saltin et al. 1970; Taylor 2000; Kenny et al. 2003). Indeed, these thermal effects could be even greater during aerobic cycling in hot environments, resulting in high skin temperatures that reduce the heat dissipation between the core and the skin (Sawka et al. 2012). This could increase core temperature to such high values (~ 40  °C) as to lead to fatigue and {{an increased risk of}} heat exhaustion and heat stroke (Nybo 2010; Sawka et al. 2012; Best et al. 2014).|$|R
