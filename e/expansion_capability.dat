50|$|On April 2014, SSL {{announced}} {{that it had been}} awarded a contract by SKY Perfect JSAT Group to manufacture two satellites: JCSAT-15 and JCSAT-16. The former would be a 10 kW satellite to be a replacement of N-SAT-110 plus <b>expansion</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The device {{runs the}} Windows Mobile 5 and 6 Smartphone Edition {{operating}} systems (AKU 3.0).

50|$|The {{standard}} GameCube controller provides {{haptic feedback}} {{by way of}} a built-in rumble motor rather than using an external Rumble Pak add-on like the Nintendo 64 controller. Also unlike its predecessor, this controller does not feature any <b>expansion</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, the Falcon {{is one of}} Atari Corp.'s {{most popular}} {{machines}} for hardware modding. Due to its <b>expansion</b> <b>capabilities,</b> several accelerators have been produced. Some of them overclock the CPU and/or the bus, while others upgrade the CPU to a Motorola 68060.|$|R
50|$|Although a claimed <b>expansion</b> <b>capability</b> of 768 dimmers was documented; early {{receivers}} used simple hardware {{counters that}} rolled over before reaching 768, effectively preventing commercial exploitation. The refresh period {{would also have}} been slow on such a long dimmer update cycle. Instead, multiple D54 streams were supported by some later consoles.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the Xerox 820-II had a {{processor}} <b>expansion</b> <b>capability,</b> which optionally supported a 16-bit Intel 8086 processor card {{with its own}} 128 kiB or 256 kiB of RAM (the 16-bit processor card did, however, employ the on-mainboard Z80A for all peripheral I/O operations, therefore the 8086 behaved more like a co-processor).|$|E

5000|$|Because the 3B5/3B15 {{was a large}} {{minicomputer}} {{with only}} 1 CPU, it was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the body without a brain".
