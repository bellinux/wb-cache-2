5|$|Broaching {{is often}} {{impossible}} without the specific broaching or keyway machines {{unless you have}} a system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra bits of equipment open up the possibility of producing <b>keyways,</b> splines and torx through one-hit machining.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, <b>keyways,</b> and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{broaching}} {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first applications used for cutting <b>keyways</b> in pulleys and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and broaching machines.|$|E
50|$|Like many lock manufacturers, Schlage uses milled complex <b>keyway</b> shapes to {{mechanically}} prevent some non-OEM {{keys from}} entering or operating a lock. New <b>keyway</b> designs may be protected {{for a limited}} time by patent protection, which expires after a set number of years.|$|R
25|$|R8 collets have a <b>keyway</b> {{to prevent}} {{rotation}} when fitting or removing, {{but it is}} the compressed taper and not the <b>keyway</b> that provides the driving force. Collets are compressed by a drawbar from behind, they are self releasing and tool changes can be automated.|$|R
50|$|A keyhole (or <b>keyway)</b> is a hole or {{aperture}} (as in a door or lock) {{for receiving}} a key. Lock <b>keyway</b> shapes vary widely with lock manufacturer, and many manufacturers {{have a number}} of unique profiles requiring a specifically milled key blank to engage the lock's tumblers.|$|R
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal <b>keyways.</b> However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut <b>keyways</b> into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016 it was {{announced}} that super-articulated control rods would be installed at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B because of concerns about the stability of the reactors' graphite cores. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) had raised concerns over the number of fractures in <b>keyways</b> that lock together the graphite bricks in the core. [...] An unusual event, such as an earthquake, might destabilise the graphite so that ordinary control rods that shut the reactor down could not be inserted. Super-articulated control rods should be insertable even into a destabilised core.|$|E

2500|$|Construction {{started with}} the {{excavation}} of {{millions of tons of}} bedrock from the canyon walls adjacent to the construction site, forming <b>keyways</b> for the dam foundations. The Shasta Route of the Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Highway 99 (current Interstate 5) were rerouted to the east over the steel truss Pit River Bridge, which remains the tallest combined road and rail bridge in the world. The bridge was built to a height of more than [...] above the Pit River, some [...] east-northeast of the dam site, to accommodate the rising waters of Shasta Lake. The bypassed segment of the railroad from Redding to the Shasta site was re-appropriated as a branch line for construction trains, and was routed through a tunnel beneath the south abutment of the dam.|$|E
50|$|Parallel, tapered, and Woodruff <b>keyways</b> can be {{produced}} on a milling machine. End mills or slotting cutters are used for parallel and tapered <b>keyways,</b> while a Woodruff cutter is used for Woodruff <b>keyways.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the SIX SIGMA concept applied to the <b>keyway</b> {{fabrication}} method used in the shaft of a 7000 gear assembly. After several preliminary studies and design changes by the engineers, the operators continue with frequent changes of the machine setup and cutter types, generating different types of dimensions in the width of the <b>keyway.</b> Additional rework are also required since some keys cannot be assembled due to the incorrect size of the <b>keyway.</b> This additional set up and rework is adding significant cost to the project.

5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment <b>keyway</b> {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot <b>keyway</b> in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a circular Woodruff cutter without any reliefs. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and <b>keyway</b> also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, snowblowers and marine propellers.|$|R

50|$|For {{additional}} interchangeable core access control, non-proprietary <b>keyways</b> and key {{sections of}} the following designations are available: A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, R, TB, TD and TE. Other less common but still non-proprietary <b>keyways</b> and key sections also exist, but these typically have differing designations from manufacturer to manufacturer, even though the components may otherwise be identical.|$|E
50|$|Wire-cut {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) is primarily used for small production lot sizes where either extreme precision is required or other cutting technologies are not readily available. Wire-cut EDM cuts <b>keyways</b> by eroding material away from the workpiece {{through a series of}} rapid electric current discharges between a spooling wire and the workpiece through a dielectric liquid. Computer numerical control (CNC) wire-cut EDM machines allow for a wide variety selection of <b>keyways</b> to be cut, inclusive of multiple <b>keyways</b> on the same hub. The main limitations of CNC wire-cut EDM is {{the time it takes to}} cut a keyway as well as the size of parts a given wire-cut EDM machine can accommodate.|$|E

40|$|A micro/hairline crack was noticed {{on a low}} speed, {{hollow shaft}} of a single stage helical gearbox during service. Though this had not {{resulted}} in a catastrophic failure, the shaft was withdrawn from service because of leakage of oil. Subsequent investigation revealed that the crack had initiated by fatigue {{at one of the}} <b>keyway</b> edges and progressed about 3 / 4 of the shaft periphery in a helical manner but had not given rise to final fracture of the shaft. The fatigue crack initiation was due to stress concentration arising from a depression mark at the <b>keyway</b> end surface. The problem was further aggravated due to inadequate radius at the <b>keyway</b> edges and rough machining marks. An analysis of the failure, together with recommendations for failure prevention, is presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The shutter motor keeps {{tripping}} out, {{and causing}} the dome to become stuck open. The dome and shutter motors were swapped over {{to eliminate a}} fault with the motor. It was discovered {{that there was no}} <b>keyway</b> on the shutter motor shaft which was allowing the motor to slip. A second fault was found on one of the SSR relays in the relay box. A <b>keyway</b> was installed, and the faulty SSR bridged out. The shutter now operates correctly. Additional work was done on the weather arm, replacing the rain detector and repairing the anemometer...|$|R
5000|$|Macroscopic and {{microscopic}} discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) {{as well as}} component {{design features}} which cause stress concentrations (holes, <b>keyways,</b> sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.|$|E

50|$|The axle {{was made}} of best Lowmoor wrought iron, and had run about 220,000 miles during its 7 years service (normal life was 10 years or 300,000 miles). The {{fracture}} surface of the principal break showed {{what is now called}} a slow growth region on the outer part of the diameter, with a fast growth section at the centre. Although Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate did not recognize the problem as fatigue, he had seen many similar fracture surfaces in his career, attributing the break to the two <b>keyways</b> machined into the outer surface of the axle. He was quite right. The fatigue cracks probably grew from {{one or more of the}} sharp corners of the <b>keyways,</b> extending slowly around the circumference until the axle could no longer support its load, and the crack (or cracks) grew catastrophically. The load on an axle is complex, but involves both bending from the load in the vehicle above, and torsion from the rotation of the axle. He suggested that the four <b>keyways</b> rather than two be used, effectively spreading the load. Nowadays, the sharpness of the corners would also be reduced, so lessening the stress concentration. Thickening the shaft was done after this accident, and would also have helped to lower net stresses in the axle.|$|E
50|$|Keying {{is done by}} one or two keys on {{the inside}} of the socket, which fit into grooves {{provided}} on the outside of the plug's shroud. The major <b>keyway</b> is 4 mm deep, and there is a corresponding flat protruding into the interior of the shroud to accommodate it. The width of the major <b>keyway</b> defines the current rating: 32 A plugs have a 5 mm wide groove, while 16 A plugs have an 8 mm groove, and will therefore fit into 32 A sockets but not vice-versa.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the colour code, connectors are keyed in one of 12 positions to ensure that incompatible utilization voltages cannot be connected. Different voltage and frequency combinations are distinguished by {{the location of the}} earth pin (or a plastic projection called the minor <b>keyway,</b> for connectors with no earth pin), as shown in the following table. The earth pin can be in one of twelve locations, described by clock positions 1h through 12h, spaced at 30° intervals around the circle on which all the pins lie. The various positions are referenced from the view of the open side of a socket; the 6 o'clock (6h, 180°) position is at the same angle as the major <b>keyway,</b> and is oriented downwards. The major <b>keyway</b> is a projection on the plug shroud which aligns with a notch on the socket. The earth pin has a larger diameter than the other pins, preventing the wrong type of plug being inserted in a socket.|$|R
