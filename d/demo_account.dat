These critiques are often understood as a crisis of legitimacy. In order to assess whether this is the case, the definition and operationalisation of legitimacy is crucial.

The latter dimension is often overlooked in other studies. The critiques of the European Court of Human Rights in the Netherlands are discussed on the basis of archival research, literature review, interviews and survey research. On the basis of the exploratory findings for the Netherlands, the article concludes that, in taking a subjective approach to legitimacy that covers all its dimensions, including support for the European <b>demos,</b> into <b>account,</b> the crisis of legitimacy could be deeper than most scholars estimate.

Values of stop loss and take profit are 20 and 50 pips, so Risk Reward Ratio is 1 : 2, 5. After the strategy was defined, it was evaluated by backtesting using existing historic data and results were compared with market yield. Both hypotheses were proved to be true, so it means the strategy was profitable in all three years (first hypothesis) and the yield of strategy was bigger than market yield in all three years (second hypothesis).

Experimental results show that our enhanced implementation allows to overcome the real-time constraint by reaching up to 120 f/s (frame/second) for Common Intermediate Format resolution (CIF 352 × 288) and 35 f/s for Standard Definition (SD 720 × 480). Our proposed approach can save about 80 % of run-time for High Definition resolution (HD 1280 × 720).

40|$|DEMO is a {{methodology}} for designing and engineering organizations which is mostly used for Information System Development (ISD) and redesigning the business processes. DEMO {{has the ability}} to reduce the complexity of an organization by providing an ontological model of that organization. Although DEMO has promising advantages and has provided successful outcome in practice, it hasn’t received the deserved attention from The individuals in practical fields. While many of the competitor methodologies are more successful and accepted among the practitioners, DEMO is at the risk of being forgotten among all other methodologies in the methodology jungle. It seems trivial to use effective tactics to increase the acceptance of DEMO among individuals in practice. These tactics can only be effective if they take the reasons behind this specific point of view about <b>DEMO</b> into <b>account.</b> Various factors from a technical anomalies to opinion of others can influence the perception of people about {{a methodology}}. While the acceptance of DEMO by people in practice is very important in the success of the methodology in practical fields, no research was found in the literature that the statistics on reports the adoption rate of DEMO in practice and identifies the reasons behind certain adoption behavior. Therefore, alongside providing such statistics the main goal of this thesis is to identify the factors that can determine certain behavior towards DEMO and propose recommendations to increase the adoption of DEMO based on these factors. We conducted this research in three phases: Theoretical, Quantitative and qualitative analysis. In theoretical analysis we have identified the factors that were proven to influence the adoption of other methodologies. In quantitative analysis we have tried to find out whether these factors have any influence on the adoption of DEMO. At the end, we captured the actual experience of the individuals in practice with DEMO. In this research we were able to identify several factors that influence the adoption of DEMO. We realized that the support of DEMO by management, coworkers, other individuals with the same skills as the individual and the eagerness of the individual to keep him self updated about DEMO can increase the adoption of DEMO to a great extent. Furthermore, uncertainty one’s position in the organization has a negative effect on the adoption of DEMO. Finally, the ability of the methodology to produce results in a way that can be communicated with all the individuals with different levels of knowledge about DEMO is also influencing the adoption of DEMO.
