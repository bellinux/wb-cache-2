50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of cultured cream {{begins with}} the standardization of fat content, this step {{is to ensure that}} the desired or legal amount of milk fat is present in the food system. As previously mentioned the minimum amount of milk fat that must be present in sour cream is 18%. During this step in the manufacturing process other dry ingredients are added with the cream, additional grade A whey for example would be added at this time. Another type of dry product that is added during this processing step are a series of ingredients known as stabilizers. The common stabilizers that are added to sour cream are polysaccharides and gelatin. Recall the ingredients in sour cream <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>components</b> that act as stabilizers; modified food starch, guar gum, and carrageenans. The reasoning behind the addition of stabilizers to fermented dairy products (sour cream, yoghurt, etc.) is provide smoothness in the body and texture of the product. The stabilizers also assist in the gel structure of the product and reduce whey syneresis. The formation of these gels structures, leaves less free water for whey syneresis, therefore extending the shelf life. Whey syneresis is the loss of moisture by the expulsion of whey. This expulsion of whey can occur during the transportation of containers holding the sour cream, due to the susceptibility to motion and agitation. The next step in the manufacturing process is the acidification of the cream. Organic acids such as citric acid or sodium citrate are added to the cream prior to homogenization in order to increase the metabolic activity of the starter culture. To prepare the mixture for homogenization, it is heated {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{question}} {{of this research}} report is: ‘Why has the current service delivery model not enabled the government to meet its social obligations?’ The South African government has a vision of establishing a democratic developmental state that would enable it to effectively address the social conditions of the masses {{of the people and}} realise economic progress for the poor. This study attempts to assess the service delivery process at the local government level to establish the factors that are contributing to the current service delivery model not enabling the government to meet its strategic intention. The analysis focuses on three key components that underpin an effective service delivery process, i. e. the governance framework, the spatial policy directives and the financial management process. In attempting to develop a response to this question, this study focuses on the water services delivery process from policy formation at national government level to service delivery in the City of Johannesburg from 2006. Research through in-depth interviews and documentation analysis was conducted at the Department of Water and Environment, City of Johannesburg and Johannesburg Water. The selection of water services from the range of public services is informed by the absolute necessity of water, as the failure of any individual or community to secure a regular supply of water will result in the loss of life. More specifically, the production and supply of food and energy are increasingly inter-linked, and both depend on a vulnerable resource: water. This immediate and universal need is the very reason why the withdrawal and denial of water services is also potentially the most explosive political issue today. The study is based on the view that a service delivery model that would enable the government to meet its social obligations must <b>include</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>components</b> : the active participation of the working class and the marginalised sectors of society in the design, development and implementation process of service delivery; a governance framework that is based on the experiences and reality of those that are marginalised; that all projects and programmes are designed with the objective of reconfiguring the socio-spatial characteristics prevalent in the apartheid era and most importantly the goals and objectives of the service delivery process must be based on achieving social value. The framework of social value demands that people have equal rights and opportunities and that basic needs such as water, electricity, shelter, health facilities, and education must be available to all. Some of the key findings of the research have shown that the current service delivery model is not based on a holistic, integrated view of service needs within the municipality leading to a lack of understanding of communities’ service needs, increase in cost, disparate information and an inability to realise the benefits of economies of scale. The current performance management system is based on revenue generation and not the number of disconnections, health cost due to inaccessibility to clean water, environmental cost due to inefficient water treatment processes, etc. With regards to the current socio-spatial dynamics it has been found that the disparities in terms of access, quality and quantity are not too dissimilar from the racial demarcations characteristic of the apartheid era. A key focus of Johannesburg City has been the establishment of utility companies based on corporate governance and profitable balance sheets while the spatial distortions of apartheid and its current manifestations have been neglected. An analysis of the complex regulatory framework governing the micro projects implemented at the local government level, revealed that the current governance mechanisms has not achieve the intended economic development as envisaged by the national government within its policy framework. In fact the municipality is facing a financial crisis, compounded by an increase in unemployment and a {{decrease in the number of}} people accessing water services as a result of high tariffs. The key finding from the analysis of the financial management process has revealed that one of the main municipal revenue sources is from basic services such as water service delivery. To ensure that the required revenue is generated, municipal entities have been structured as corporations to enable them to sell services at a market related price and to ring fence the financial management process to assist with efficient billing and revenue management necessary for funding the local government bureaucracy. Finally, the research on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project confirmed that the agenda put forward by the World Bank and the World Water Council, significantly influences domestic policy formulation, specifically in terms of institutional arrangements for water service delivery, cost recovery and water resource management. The case of the LHWP bears testimony to the fact that these global institutions have a significant influence on corporatizing natural resources by developing mega projects for the financial benefit of transnational corporation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the major ideas of Mahatma Gandhi on social stratification and social inequality. The methodology consists of systematically reading and analyzing the literature {{through which the}} theoretical components of social stratification in Gandhi's writings become more explicit, and evaluating these theoretical components. A systematic statement of Gandhi's theory of social stratification <b>included</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> five <b>components.</b> First, social differentiation is inherent in human nature. Gandhi believed in the universality of social differentiations and was convinced that societies were organized into the divisions {{on the basis of}} vocations. Second, relations among strata imply that a division of labor is essential for the stability and organization of society. Gandhi also implied that this division of labor is necessary and functional. Third, normative patterns establish traditions of heredity. To Gandhi, the four divisions in society defined a person's "calling" which is essential for social organization. Fourth, the system of stratification is the universal law that everyone is obliged to follow. Gandhi tried to legitimize social stratification through moral and religious values of the society. Fifth, social stratification system defines duties only and does not confer any privileges. To Gandhi, the divisions of people into strata was the best possible adjustment of social stability and progress. While accepting some form of social stratification for the benefit of total funcioning of the society, Gandhi refused to accept that social inequality necessarily grows out of the process of social stratification. To maintain the hereditary law of social stratification and reduce the inequality, Gandhi suggested the abolition of the present caste system and the revival of four orders of social organization, the removal of the concept of untouchability, the regulation of trusteeship, decentralization of power, the increase of women's status, and vocational education for all...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} essence of the social work {{relationship}} {{from the perspective of the}} social worker, that is, the social workers 'use of self'. Whilst the 'use of self' denotes key facets a worker should bring to practice including an high level of self-awareness and self-knowledge, examination into what the 'use of self' or 'self' means is left largely unexplored. This thesis will do two things: firstly it will critique literature to find out what is known about the 'use of self' and 'self' in social work and other disciplines; and secondly it will propose a universal 'use of self' Integral framework for the practice of social work. Studies have shown that the 'use of self' directly influences the quality of the social work relationship and practice outcomes more than the application of any specific technique (Howe, 1993). However, the analysis also demonstrates that the current thinking on the 'use of self' doesn't go far enough. The notion of the 'use of self' being explored in this thesis is one which is viewed through the Integral model as developed by Ken Wilber (1996, 2000) and further explored by Sean Esbjorn-Hargens (2009, 2014). The definition of 'self' being used in this thesis is, "the 'self' is that which attempts to integrate or balance all of the components of the psyche at any given level of consciousness development including: body, mind, soul" (Wilber, 2000, p. 4). This thesis highlights that whilst there are some individual discussions on topics such as the social self and personality, it also demonstrates that there is no consensus on what is the 'use of self' and 'self' within social work practice nor is there a universal framework relating to the 'use of self' and 'self'. Through exploring other disciplines, it is shown that the 'self' is not a new notion but as ancient as philosophy and religion themselves, and through these disciplines a fuller picture of the 'use of self' (albeit not final) is considered. In order to make sense of the existing knowledge (from the selected texts) regarding the 'use of self' and 'self', the thesis draws upon Wilber's Integral model (1996, 2000) as an integrative application. The Integral model (Wilber, 1996, 2000) is being used as a lens in which to discuss the results from the textual analysis and as a basis from which to develop a universal workers' 'use of self' Integral framework for the practice of social work. I have done this by <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>components</b> of Wilber's model (1996, 2000) : the four quadrants with its guiding principles of Integral meta-theory, Integral Methodological Pluralism, multiple perspectives and the notion of whole/part. These are described in further detail in Chapter four. What this thesis will do, is critically analyse a select number of texts from social work and other disciplines knowledge to find the 'orientating generalisations' (Wilber, 2000, p. 5) of the 'use of self' and 'self' and show the analysis through Wilber's Integral model lens (1996, 2000). Wilber (2000) explains of his Integral model, "it is a string[ing] together" (p. 5) of accepted knowledge. It is a philosophical model containing, [quote] "'orientating generalisations' … [that have] … a great deal of agreement (although the specifics maybe hotly debated) … [and provide] the broad outlines of which really has an awful lot of supporting evidence. [Wilber's model culls] from these orientating generalisations … [of] the various branches of human knowledge" (Wilber, 2000, p. 5). By showing the analysis though this Integral model the basis of a 'use of self' Integral framework for social work practice will be proposed. The thesis identifies what becomes possible for a robust 'use of self' in social work practice when a worker's 'self' is incorporated into an understanding of a 'use of self' and both applied to an Integral framework. A number of new horizons for the social work profession will be considered in the concluding chapter...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{symposium on}} The Ecology of Mangrove and Related Ecosystems, Mombasa, Kenya, 24 - 30 September, 1990, {{was organized by}} the Department of Zoology, University of Nairobi, {{in collaboration with the}} Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, and the Regional Dispatch Centre of the Regional Cooperation in Scientific Information Exchange in the West Indian Ocean, Mombasa, Kenya. It was officially opened by Professor F. N. Onyango, Principal, College of Biological and Physical Sciences, University of Nairobi. The closing address was given by Professor M. Hyder, retired Principal and Professor of Zoology, CBPS, University of Nairobi. Scientific investigations of the mangrove and coral reef ecosystems in Kenya have been going on at least since the early 70 ’s and have been gathering momentum with the involvement of the University of Nairobi, KMFRI, and British, Belgian, Dutch and Italian universities and scientific institutions. So the time was ripe to take stock of the situation and to try to bring together workers in the same field from as many tropical regions as possible. A cursory glance at the list of participants is sufficient proof of the widespread interest in the theme of the symposium. Contributions came from all the main tropical marine areas of the globe, representing twenty-three countries, in West and Eastern Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Australia. The thirty papers published in this volume were selected from seventy presented at the symposium. It is recognized that the mangroves have intimate and complex linkages with other coastal systems, notably seagrass beds and coral reefs. So, starting from the mangrove forest and its users at the interface between the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, the papers presented proceed to the fully submerged seagrasses and further out to the corals. The nature of the coupling between the different systems was touched on at the symposium, but stands out as a serious gap in our knowledge. Next, chemical and physical processes which constitute the mechanisms of linkage received attention. Human uses and abuses of the ecosystems formed the last major topic of the symposium. Workshop discussions were held during the symposium in preparation for the adoption in plenary session of two declarations: A Statement of Priorities for Scientific Research and A Declaration on Management Strategies. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> priorities for basic research were agreed : the interlinkages between the mangrove, coral reef and seagrass ecosystems; the need for more information on nearshore hydrological processes operating at the small and meso-scale and elaboration of predictive models; more work on nutrient cycling and energy flow including soil processes; biological processes and use of bio-indicators. Priorities were also set for applied research. This, it was agreed, should be directed towards management of the forest or aquatic product on a sustainable basis, taking into account the integrated nature of the ecosystems. Emphasis should be placed on minimizing perturbations to the systems and the maintenance of ecological integrity. Broad areas needing investigation were identified: methods for efficient and ecologically sound land use in the watershed adjacent to the mangal, seagrass beds and coral reefs; effect of management of the mangroves on off-shore fisheries; impact of industralization on the mangal and related ecosystems; effect of domestic and industrial effluents and management of their impact; comparative studies on destructive and non-destructive aquacultural techniques with a view to minimizing negative effects; the effect of human activities on physical, chemical and biological soil processes; research on management practices appropriate to different mangrove forest types and promotion of a biotechnological aproach in mangrove silviculture; socio-economic studies of human coastal settlements; natural products of the mangals; the impact of global climate change; and active rehabilitation of seagrass beds and coral reefs. The Declaration on Management Strategies was positive, concluding that much can be done to stop the degradation of damaged mangals, seagrass beds and coral reefs and to rehabilitate them, but that new techniques must be worked out to allow use on a sustainable basis for long term economic return and for the wellbeing of coastal human settlements and a healthy environment. To achieve the above goals the Symposium recommended <b>the</b> <b>following</b> strategies. <b>The</b> establishment of National Coastal Management Plans <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>components</b> : survey of both natural and human resources and their present uses; identification of the problems affecting coastal ecosystems; adjustment of legal frameworks with regard to the uses of these ecosystems and enforcement of existing management regulations; provision of technical assistance and training for the introduction of economically and ecologically viable activities in these ecosystems; rehabilitation of damaged areas; creation of natural reserves both for tourism and for the recuperation of natural plant and animal populations; education and creation of public awareness on the value and problems of these ecosystems. In formulating and implementing each national Plan all concerned parties should be involved, i. e., the inhabitants and the outside users of these ecosystems, the policy makers, the scientists and technical experts, and also the national and international funding agencies. Use should be made of existing institutions and networks. The scientists gathered in the symposium urged the establishment or strengthening of regional and international associations of scientists to provide the scientific basis to national and regional management plans...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Duke Interdisciplinary Social Innovators (DISI) is a {{model for}} {{organizing}} graduate students at universities to do interdisciplinary, problem-oriented projects for non-profit clients. In its first year, 149 students from eight different Duke graduate schools will complete 24 projects for North Carolina social organizations. Eighty-five percent of students and 100 percent of clients expressed satisfaction with their first semester DISI project experience. As a result, The Scholar Strategy Network (SSN) is exploring the possibility of expanding the model to other Universities and has asked me to answer <b>the</b> <b>following</b> question. Policy Question How can graduate students set up an interdisciplinary, client-oriented service organization? Recommendations: The MP analyzes the steps DISI’s Co-Founders took to set up DISI at Duke and their successes and failures. It {{is too early to}} tell if the model will work in the long term. However, others who want to set-up similar organizations at other universities should use <b>the</b> <b>following</b> steps: 1. 	Analyze the graduate education structure of their school, determine if interdisciplinary collaboration is possible, what form it will take, and who are the key stakeholders to invest in the idea. 2. 	Recruit student leaders, have student leaders meet with key university and community stakeholders to solicit funds, student recruiting relationships, and non-profit project relationships. 3. 	Visualize an organization structure and a project team structure, using information provided here as a guide. Consider the academic calendar and the student culture of all graduate schools. 4. 	Create initial branding material. Recruit a few initial projects and determine initial Skill Share events to entice student participation and help. 5. 	Have initial investment meeting to recruit student volunteers to help over the summer. These students are potentially the first executive board members. 6. 	Use summer to plan and begin to plan and execute student recruitment, partner recruitment, fund solicitation, and skill share events as possible. This could include creating materials, outreaching to orientation leaders to plan recruitment events, and e-mailing non-profits. 7. 	When the school year begins, execute student recruitment and project matching processes. This includes interviewing project managers. 8. 	Monitor progress, execute Skill Share events and social events. 1. 3 Methodology My strategy for answering <b>the</b> policy question <b>included</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> four major <b>components.</b> 1. Background research and a review of the relevant literature. 2. Review of the interdisciplinary landscape at Duke and other schools. 3. Review of the steps DISI’s Co-founders took to start the organ Duke. 4. Review of preliminary DISI data...|$|R
