The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat at all.

5|$|Traditionally, three {{distinct}} subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P.c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P.c.cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P.c.victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala {{is the smallest}} of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit. Other studies have found that koala populations <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inbreeding and low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene. Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations. In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.|$|E

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} shown to have an effect on children's socialization skills. In particular, some research suggests that children of more sensitive caregivers <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> effortful (i.e. emotional and behavioural) control. Such control is proposed to have been fostered from the infancy stage when the a sensitive mother's quick and appropriate responses to the baby's distress teaches the baby to adjust his/her arousal. This speedy regulation of arousal is then adapted into childhood resulting in the ability to regulate emotion and behaviour well.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{memory is}} usually short-term, lasting between {{a few days}} and several months. Newborn infants have had no prior {{exposure}} to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. In utero, maternal IgG is transported directly across the placenta, so that, at birth, human babies <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> antibodies, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk contains antibodies (mainly IgA) that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} birds have {{acquired}} methods {{that allow them to}} ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether professional developmen t a nd collaboration practices are a ffected by performance pay in schools. The study investigated the differences in perceptions of principals, veteran teachers, and beginning teachers. S ix questions and statements were posed relating to both professional development and collaboration. Based on the findings, no significant difference in perception of professional development and collaboration exists between educators currently utilizing a compensation model and those not utilizing a compensation model. Second, where a compensation model was implemented, principals were predicted to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> agreement regarding their views on professional development. Additionally, beginnin g teachers were predicted to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> agreement regarding their views on professional development than veteran teachers. Third, where a compensation model was not implemented, principals were predicted to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> agreement regar ding their views on professional development. Also, beginning teachers were predicted to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> agreement regarding professional development than veteran teachers.

25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> TNF-α in their blood and in dermatological lesions. In contrast, in vitro assay demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the plant}} family Cucurbitacea, which {{includes}} zucchini/marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions/irregular watering can stress the plant and favor {{the production of the}} toxin. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly among the elderly) should therefore ask a younger person to taste the zucchini for them.|$|E
25|$|Research in Italy {{suggests}} that healthy centenarians <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> both vitamin A and vitamin E {{and that this}} seems to be important in causing their extreme longevity. Other research contradicts this, however, and has found that this theory does not apply to centenarians from Sardinia, for whom other factors probably play a more important role. A preliminary study carried out in Poland showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in Upper Silesia had significantly higher red blood cell glutathione reductase and catalase activities, although serum levels of vitamin E were not significantly higher. Researchers in Denmark have also found that centenarians exhibit a high activity of glutathione reductase in red blood cells. In this study, the centenarians having the best cognitive and physical functional capacity tended to have the highest activity of this enzyme.|$|E
