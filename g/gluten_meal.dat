40|$|Waxy corn is a {{class of}} corn (Zea mays 1.) {{developed}} for the industrial process known as "wet milling, " leading {{to the production of}} corn starch, corn <b>gluten</b> <b>meals,</b> corn oil, and corn gluten feed. The waxy characteristic is the re-sult of a single recessive waxy (m) gene. The starch component of waxy corn is composed almost exclusively of amylopectin, while nor-mal corn contains about 73 % amylopectin and 27 % amylose. While amylose is a straight chain molecule, amylopectin is highly branched, giv-ing more desirable properties to the corn starch. The term "waxy " is something of a mk-nomer as there is no waxper se in the grain. Rather, when waxy corn is dried, the endo-sperm takes on a cloudy appearance, whereas that of normal corn remains translucent.

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity is a {{state of}} chronic low-grade {{inflammation}}. Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of both type- 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Prevention or reduction of chronic low-grade inflammation may be advantageous in relation to obesity related co-morbidity. In this study we investigated the acute effect of dietary protein sources on postprandial low-grade inflammatory markers after a high-fat meal in obese non-diabetic subjects. Methods We conducted a randomized, acute clinical intervention study in a crossover design. We supplemented a fat rich mixed meal with one of four dietary proteins - cod protein, whey isolate, gluten or casein. 11 obese non-diabetic subjects (age: 40 - 68, BMI: 30. 3 - 42. 0 kg/m 2) participated and blood samples were drawn in the 4 h postprandial period. Adiponectin was estimated by ELISA methods and cytokines were analyzed by multiplex assay. Results MCP- 1 and CCL 5 /RANTES displayed significant postprandial dynamics. CCL 5 /RANTES initially increased after all meals, but overall CCL 5 /RANTES incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was significantly lower after the whey meal compared with the cod and casein meals (P = 0. 0053). MCP- 1 was initially suppressed after all protein meals. However, the iAUC was significantly higher after whey meal compared to the cod and <b>gluten</b> <b>meals</b> (P = 0. 04). Conclusion We have demonstrated acute differential effects on postprandial low grade inflammation of four dietary proteins in obese non-diabetic subjects. CCL 5 /RANTES initially increased after all meals but the smallest overall postprandial increase was observed after the whey meal. MCP- 1 was initially suppressed after all 4 protein meals and the whey meal caused the smallest overall postprandial suppression. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT 00863564 </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is gluten-free diet - reality in schools facilities. The {{goal of this}} work {{was to determine the}} number of school cafeterias in the Vysocina Region which provide gluten-free meals, to evaluate awareness of the canteen staff about preparation of the gluten-free diet and to describe the cooperation between the school cafeteria and family of the pupil with gluten-free diet. School meals are important to provide optimal intake of nutrition during the time the child spends in school, to establish proper eating habits and to better integrate the child into the group of its peers. Gluten-free diet is a necessary medical precaution especially for those with coeliac disease, in which case gluten can lead to villous atrophy, and for those with gluten allergy for whom gluten intake can cause anaphylactic shock. Adherence to the gluten-free diet is recommended also to those with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity diagnosis, although gluten causes only short-term complications, usually intestinal. The method of quantitative and qualitative research was used to make this thesis. The research sample consisted of 8 school cafeterias from the Vysocina Region which provide gluten-free meal to their pupils. Awareness about gluten-free diet principles of the managers of the cafeterias or of the cooks responsible for preparation of gluten-free meal was determined by means of semi-structured interviews. The calculation of the two-day menu of each cafeteria by means of the Nutriservis Profesional program was also part of this thesis. The results were compared with the recommended daily intake of energy, proteins, fat, and saccharides for pupils of elementary and secondary schools. The results of the quantitative research show that gluten-free diet is provided by {{only a small percentage of}} school cafeterias in the Vysocina Region. The qualitative research prove sufficient awareness of the cooks about gluten-free diet, with awareness of those cooks directly responsible for preparation of <b>gluten</b> free <b>meals</b> being at much higher level.

30|$|Feed {{contamination}} is {{a worldwide}} major current concern {{with regard to}} consumer health, economic losses, and safety and reliability of food products (Maule et al. 2007; Pettersson 2012; O’Keefe and Campabadal 2015). In general, melamine (MEL) and its derivatives including cyanuric acid (CYA), ammeline (AMN), and ammelide (AMD), are commonly used in thermoplastic materials, such as dishware, laminating resins, coating materials, and fire retardants (Casu et al. 1997; Roviello et al. 2015). Moreover, the US Food and Drug Administration (2007) reported illegal adulteration of animal feed with MEL and CYA in many countries. MEL is a nitrogenous material with 66 % nitrogen by mass. Therefore, adding MEL in a foodstuff increases the total nitrogen content typically determined by the Kjeldahl method to estimate the protein content, so MEL {{is also known as}} a “fake protein” (US-FDA 2007; Reimschuessel et al. 2008). For this reason, protein-rich ingredients are the major targets for MEL adulteration that has been documented in many feedstuffs, such as fishmeal, <b>gluten,</b> soybean <b>meal,</b> squid meal, and shrimp meal, and contamination of pets and farm animals including fish and shrimp has also been reported (Ehling et al. 2007; WHO 2009). Adverse effects of MEL and CYA have been reported in different fish species; these included growth retardation, behavioral abnormalities, immunosuppression, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity (Reimschuessel et al. 2010; Xue et al. 2011; Pirarat et al. 2012; Pacini et al. 2013; Phromkunthong et al. 2013, 2015 a, b; Mahardika et al. 2017). Thus, contamination of feed with MEL and CYA is one of the critical concerns in aquatic industry. To date, due to its toxic effects and other potential health effects impacting consumers, many countries have incorporated MEL and its structural analogs into a list of food additives and substances prohibited in animal feeds. In Europe, the maximum permitted levels of MEL in feed are strictly set as 2.5  mg kg− 1 (European Commission 2013). In 2016, the Department of Livestock Development, Thailand has banned dried squid-derived meal imported from Vietnam after laboratory tests indicated the presence of CYA (Byrne 2016), and there is evidence that these chemical substances are still being used illegally {{in some parts of the}} world.|$|R

Variables measured after the incubation were total volatile fatty acid (VFA), ammonia, dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and crude protein digestibility (CPD). Results revealed that among the forages, cassava leaf had the highest proportion of NDICP while corn gluten feed was the highest among the concentrates. Different from that of NDICP, the highest proportion of ADICP was obtained in papaya leaf and copra meal for the forages and concentrates, respectively. Higher proportion of NDICP tended to decrease CPD (P< 0. 1). Although higher ADICP apparently tended to decrease CPD as well, the relationship was insignificant due to the higher variation of the dependent variable.

40|$|The {{potential}} to reduce feed formulation costs by {{the replacement of}} existing proteinsources in artificial feeds for Haliotis midae was assessed. A comparison between {{the efficacy of the}} direct method and chromic oxide marker techniques in determining apparent protein digestibility coefficients, revealed that while the former was not a suitable methodology for use with this species, the latter produced replicable and reliable results. It was established that the chromic oxide marker is inert, is not absorbed by the abalone, does not interfere with the digestive processes and moves through the intestine at the same rate to the protein. However, as this method was time consuming and expensive to implement, a multienzyme pH-stat in vitro protein digestibility technique using a three enzyme system was employed to rapidly assess the protein quality of 34 protein sources. The efficacy of the technique was established by correlating the in vitro digestibility estimates with in vivo digestibility coefficients obtained using the chromic oxide marker technique. The highest degree of in vivo predictability was attained when protein sources were separated according to origin, and significant correlations between either animal (r²= 0. 89, P< 0. 004) or plant (r²= 0. 79, P< 0. 04) protein sources were found. The effect of animal size on the qualitative protein requirements of two size classes of H. midae was assessed by feeding 12 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic single protein diets to juvenile and young adult animals (10 - 20 and 40 - 50 mm shell length). The criteria for protein source selection were their bioavailability as determined using the pH-stat in vitro digestibility technique, and their cost and availability within South Africa. The protein sources identified for the trial comprised four fishmeals, casein, spirulina, abalone viscera silage, brewery waste, torula yeast, carcass, sunflower and cotton meals. The results indicated that in terms of growth and feed efficiency, the fishmeals and spirulina were the most suitable candidates as primary protein sources in formulated feeds for H. midae, and with the exceptions of the carcass meal and brewery waste, the remaining protein sources demonstrated promise as partial primary protein source replacements. The smaller size class of abalone displayed significantly reduced growth, feed and protein efficiency than their larger counterparts. In terms of feed conversion and growth response, two-way analysis of variance revealed significant interactions between protein source and animal size, suggesting that qualitative differences exist between the dietary protein requirements of the juvenile and young adult abalone. The commercial implication of thisfinding was discussed. An evaluation was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} the partial and total replacement of dietary fishmeal with selected plant protein sources on growth and nutritional indices of juvenile H. midae. A commercial “Abfeed” formulation in which 100 % of the protein component comprised LT-fishmeal was employed as a control. Fifteen isonitrogenous experimental diets were formulated in which the LT fishmeal was substituted at either 10, 15, 30, 50, 75 or 100 % with either spirulina, semolina, ground maize, torula yeast, soya, sunflower or corn <b>gluten</b> <b>meals</b> or combinations thereof. No significant differences were found in the growth rates between the control diet and those diets in which 30 % of the fishmeal component had been replaced by either soya, sunflower meal, or torula yeast. In addition, 50 % of the fishmeal component could be substituted with either soya meal or spirulina without affecting growth. Replacement of either 75 or 100 % of the fishmeal had a significant negative affect on growth. Pearson product moment correlations between dietary lysine levels and either growth rates or protein efficiency ratios revealed positive correlations (r= 0. 77, P= 0. 0005; r= 0. 52, P= 0. 04 respectively) suggesting that lysine may have been the first limiting amino acid in these diets. Carcass analysis revealed that dietary protein source had no significant effect on body composition. An assessment of the dietary arginine requirement of juvenile H. midae using whole proteins to supply graded levels of dietary arginine did not promote a growth response. It was concluded that arginine is probably not the first limiting amino acid in formulated feeds for H. midae. An assessment of the dietary lysine requirement of juvenile H. midae using two micro-encapsulation techniques (gelatin/acacia colloid or cellulose acetate phthalate) was not successful. The efficacy of the encapsulation techniques were established and an assessment of the degree of lysine supplementation undertaken. Failure of the crystalline lysine enriched diets to promote growth suggests that the prospects for using crystalline amino acids in essential amino acid requirement studies in H. midae is low. The results of the present study indicate that the prospects for replacing fishmeal with cheaper alternative protein sources in artificial feeds for H. midae is promising. Furthermore, while the technical difficulties such as the determination of the essential amino acid requirements of the abalone precluded the application of “least cost” programming, the prospects for its future application are promising...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome (type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia), is increasing in prevalence world-wide. The progression of this syndrome proceeds through a step-wise deterioration of metabolic events where deterioration of insulin sensitivity {{appears to have}} a key role in a ?vicious circle? of hyperinsulinaemia/hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. Food factors inducing low postprandial glycaemic and insulin responses, and improving insulin sensitivity might thus be advantageous. Recent data suggest that certain proteins and protein-containing foods e. g. milk, may exert insulinotrophic effects in healthy subjects, without a concomitant postprandial hyperglycaemia. The longer?term metabolic effects of non-glucose mediated insulin secretion remain to be elucidated, and reports concerning the impact of milk proteins, or type and/or amount of other dietary protein sources on metabolic risk factors are, however, contradictory. The present thesis investigates the role of certain food proteins on insulin secretion and blood glucose regulation, focusing on milk proteins. In particular, the key determinants at food- and physiological level, respectively, have been examined. Dairy proteins, in particular the whey protein fraction, were found to be potent insulin secretagogues in healthy subjects, whereas cod and gluten did not stimulate postprandial insulin release. A positive correlation was seen between postprandial insulinaemia and responses of leucine, isoleucine, valine, threonine and lysine. Whey also induced a high GIP response compared with milk, cheese, cod and, <b>gluten</b> <b>meals.</b> Breakfast and lunch meals supplemented with whey, as opposed to a protein equivalent amount of ham, increased insulin response by 31 % and 57 % following breakfast and lunch, respectively, in subjects with diabetes type 2. The whey supplementation reduced glycaemia at lunch by 21 % (P< 0. 05), and reduced glycaemic excursions from fasting value {{over the course of the}} day (0 - 7 h) by 12 % (P< 0. 05). Insulinogenic properties of different amino acids, or of postprandial serum obtained following ingestion of whey or white wheat bread (WWB), were investigated in vitro using isolated Langerhans islets. Serum, withdrawn at 15 and 30 min, respectively, after a whey meal, increased insulin release in vitro (+ 87 % at 15 min, + 139 % at 30 min) compared with corresponding serum after WWB. Further, leucine (+ 105 %), threonine (+ 97 %) and to a lesser extent isoleucine (+ 45 %) potentiated insulin secretion in the presence of glucose (8. 3 mM), compared with glucose alone, whereas lysine and valine did not. Exposing Langerhans islets to a combination of the above amino acids increased insulin secretion further (+ 270 %), particularly when also including GIP (+ 558 %). In healthy subjects, a test drink with leucine, isoleucine, valine, and glucose resulted in higher insulin responses than pure glucose (+ 40 %), whereas the combination of lysine, threonine, and glucose had no effect. A drink with all five amino acids and glucose mimicked the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses seen after whey ingestion. The drink with the five amino acids also induced similar postprandial plasma amino acid responses, except for leucine which caused a higher increment (P< 0. 05). The whey meal was accompanied by a higher GIP response (+ 80 %, P< 0. 05), whereas the drinks containing free amino acids did not affect GIP. The effect of milk induced hyperinsulinaemia on semi-acute metabolic responses at a second standardised meal was studied in healthy subjects. Breakfast meals differing in GI/II characteristics were included to study the impact of non-glucose mediated hyperinsulinaemia (whey GI= 53 /II= 140) versus the impact of differences in insulinaemia caused by differences in the rate of glucose delivery to the blood (pasta GI= 56 /II= 32 vs white bread GI= 100 /GI= 100). In addition, a rye bread product with a high GI (81), and a low II (56), mediated by unidentified food factors, was included. The postprandial glycaemia after the standardised lunch post pasta breakfast was lower (- 48 %, P< 0. 05) compared with the WWB breakfast. Although the whey breakfast had low GI properties similar to the pasta, no effect on postprandial glycaemia was seen after the standardised lunch. Nor did whey-induced hyperinsulinaemia (II= 140) at breakfast deteriorate glucose tolerance at the proceeding standardised lunch compared with a WWB breakfast (II= 100). It is concluded that milk induced hyperinsulinaemia primarily relates to the whey fraction. The insulinotrophic features of whey could be simulated in healthy subjects with a drink containing a mixture of leucine, isoleucine, valine, threonine and lysine. In accordance with whey, these amino acids increased in postprandial plasma, but with no concomitant increase in GIP, indicating that the insulinotrophic effect of whey is mediated by a rapid postprandial response of these amino acids, rather than by stimulation of the incretin hormones. No detrimental effects of whey-induced hyperinsulinaemia were seen on glucose tolerance in healthy subjects in the perspective from a test breakfast to a standardised lunch. Enclosure of whey at breakfast and lunch facilitated blood glucose regulation in type 2 diabetics, indicating a therapeutic role of certain proteins in individuals with diminished insulin secretory capacity...|$|R
