40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of acne {{is generally}} believed {{to involve the}} generation of fatty acids from sebum lipids by bacterial lipases. Following purification and characterization of these lipases a systematic study of inhibitors was undertaken. The class of halopyridyl phosphorus compounds, such as o,o-dimethyl-o-(3, 5, 6 trichloro- 2 -pyridyl) phosphate, <b>fospirate,</b> proved to be potent inhibitors in vitro at concentrations as low as 10 - 8 M. These compounds are so potent that the topical application of one dose of <b>fospirate</b> (3 mg/ 100 cm 2 of facial skin) suppressed the fatty acids 40 % within the initial 12 hr of exposure. This {{is comparable to the}} suppression induced by one month of systemic tetracycline. To study the effect of <b>fospirate</b> on acne vulgaris, 10 patients with Grade II-III disease were studied over 8 weeks. The patients were treated for 3 weeks with vehicle only to determine baseline values and then for 5 weeks with twice daily applications for <b>fospirate.</b> Although the fatty acids were decreased dramatically in all patients, bacterial counts and lesion counts remained unchanged. The clinical severity of the acne remained unchanged. These results suggest that the generation of fatty acids by bacterial lipases is unrelated to the pathogenesis of acne and that the bacteria are not dependent on lipases for energy requirements. A reevaluation of the role of fatty acids in the pathogenesis of acne is needed...|$|E
