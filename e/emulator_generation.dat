30|$|User defined {{workload}} {{the benchmark}} user implements a workload emulation tool {{based on the}} knowledge he has about the service being tested. This emulator can be integrated in our robustness-testing setup (by using the wsrbench API [31] and performing some simple configurations). To simplify the workload <b>emulator</b> <b>generation</b> there are several easy to use client emulation tools like soapUI [33] and WS-TAXI [34] that can be applied. In theory any similar tool can be used, although in practice the amount of technical effort required can vary, depending on the specificities of the workload generation tool being used.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{increased}} computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of <b>emulators,</b> the sixth <b>generation</b> saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Mega Drive/Genesis, the PlayStation (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the Nintendo 64.|$|R
40|$|Thesis is {{adressed}} to {{the principals}} of a satellite navigation. It {{is focused on}} a determination of a longitude, latitude and altitude of a single point {{on the surface of}} the Earth. It contains analysis of navigation messages and a manner of processing of navigation signals in GPS receivers. Realization of an emulator of the navigation signal of GPS system in Matlab is also described. The purpose of this <b>emulator</b> is a <b>generation</b> of navigation messages, which could be transmitted by universal software radio. The last part of thesis contains the analysis of these signals, which were captured by second software radio...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a co-simulation {{solution}} between SystemC {{and a new}} <b>generation</b> <b>emulator</b> called ZeBu. SystemC is a C++ hardware description library that supports design modeling from the RT level to the system level. SystemC is part icularly effective for IP and embedded systems verification. ZeBu is a hardware verification product built on a PCI card with the latest Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA devices. First, we discuss a verification scenario based on a SystemC test bench stimulating the design mapped in the emulation board via bit-signals/vectors, and propose an implementation solution. This method offers the simplicity of use but limits its performance to few hundred KHz. To push the performance into the MHz, we then propose to {{raise the level of}} abstraction using the SystemC channels in a transactional mode. This approach allows a transaction level systemC test bench to be easily connected to the emulator for high-speed performance...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{our work}} with an emulator based on {{field programmable gate array}} technology. This technology has made possible the construction of hardware emulators capable of emulating systems having a million gates at clock speeds of 1 MHz and more. Thus it is now possible to run realistic workloads on prospective designs and measure the results. There are three areas that these new emulators can be applied to: 1) validation; 2) concurrent hardware and software development; and 3) rapid prototyping of design alternatives. The report outlines the technology of emulators discussing strengths and weaknesses. It discusses our experiments with a second <b>generation</b> <b>emulator.</b> Concluding remarks address the future potential of this technology. 1. Introduction The dramatic growth in integration levels has resulted in integrated circuits that routinely contain over a million gates. This has had a major impact on the way in which computers and digital systems in general are designed and [...] ...|$|R
