Based on the model, we propose a proactive discovery algorithm to continuously present the most relevant services to the user in response to changes of context, services or user preferences. Numeric coding methods are applied in different phases of the algorithm to improve its performance. A proactive service discovery system is proposed and the context model is grounded in a smart home environment.

The synchronization protocol Let us divide the processes of the time service into masters (processes that have direct access to an external time source) and servers [cri 89]. We also suppose that a master considers every message, received from a server during an FME, as an <b>implicit</b> <b>request</b> to read its clock. Instead of immediately replying as in [cri 89], the master records {{the value of its}} clock and continues its work.

40|$|In {{mathematics}} curricula {{teachers often}} find the {{more or less}} <b>implicit</b> <b>request</b> to link the taught subjects to the previous knowledge of the students, for example using word problems from everyday life. But in today’s multicultural and multisocial society teachers can no longer assume that the children they teach have {{a more or less}} equal background and thus everyday live can have a very different meaning for different children. Furthermore there is evidence that good previous knowledge in arithmetic can hinder the approach to other mathematical subjects, like algebra. In this paper I want to provide a brief overview on how previous knowledge in arithmetic can affect studentś access to algebra and therefore present an early algebra teaching project which introduces elementary school children to algebraic notation by measurement in an action-oriented way. Thereby the chosen approach to algebra explicitly does not come back to the studentś previous arithmetical knowledge but additionally may support non-proficient students in obtaining more insight in the structure of calculations and hence may help them to have more success in solving calculations and word problems...|$|E
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} embargoed until April 2019. In this chapter I examine {{interactions}} between the clients and the staff members of a Therapeutic Community (TC). The TC clients sometimes use expressions of need (“I need X”) and desire (“I would like X”) to convey <b>implicit</b> <b>requests</b> for assistance. Analysis illustrates that with these expressions the clients provide the staff members {{with an opportunity to}} offer assistance, instead of overtly demanding it. This can put the TC staff members in a delicate position when, for several reasons, they may be reluctant to assist the clients in the achievement of particular goals (such as renewing a driver’s license, buying a car, etc.). The staff members sometimes deal with this problem by disaffiliating with the clients’ projects to achieve particular outcomes (e. g. renewing a driver’s license) on the basis that the clients (allegedly) lack entitlement to those outcomes. This practice enables the staff members to convey that assistance will not be provided, without saying it in so many words...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} reports that perceiving body movements of other people activates motor representations in the observer’s brain. This automatic resonance mechanism appears to be imitative in nature. However, action observation does not inevitably lead to symmetrical motor facilitation: Mirroring the observed movement might be disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions. What remains unknown is how we are to resolve the possible conflict between the automatic tendency to “mirror” {{and the need to}} perform different context-related complementary actions. By using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that observation of a double-step action characterized by an <b>implicit</b> complementary <b>request</b> engendered a shift from symmetrical simulation to reciprocity in the participants’ corticospinal activity. Accordingly, differential motor facilitation was revealed for the snapshots evoking imitative and complementary gestures {{despite the fact that the}} observed type of grasp was identical. Control conditions in which participants observed the same action sequence but in a context not implying a complementary request were included as well. The results provide compelling evidence that when an observed action calls for a nonidentical complementary action, an interplay between the automatic tendency to resonate with what is observed and to implicitly prepare for the complementary action does emerge. In other words, <b>implicit</b> complementary <b>requests</b> might have the ability to draw attention to specific features of the context affording nonidentical responses...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{learning}} {{material is}} associated with grand expectations among educational policy makers. Several attempts to introduce this new technology {{with the purpose of}} enhancing learning have been made in recent years. The schooling system has, however, been rather hesitant and not so ready to adopt this kind of teaching aid. The aim of this thesis is to probe into students‘ practical problems of understanding computerised science learning material involving animated sequences and educational text. For the purpose of this investigation an application describing the different events in the carbon cycle was developed. Two studies present analyses of students‘ reasoning and actions when working collaboratively with the task of making a written account of what is illustrated in the learning material. Both studies present examples of identified phenomena that were observed in more extensive empirical materials. The data is represented by video recordings of students‘ interaction with each other and the interface. Results from the studies reveal students‘ propensity for concentrating their attention to prominent characteristics of the animated display and to describe the animated models in correspondence to their resemblance of objects and occurrences in everyday life. In study II it is revealed how students, when constructing a written report of the described events, derive noun phrases from attentionally detected objects in the animation and from the educational text. In their effort to express themselves in colloquial language, when preparing their report, they deliberately select verbs that differ from the educational text. These courses of action together, contribute to give the report on what happens in the process a non-scientific explanation. It is concluded that students, lacking definite access to the relevant subject matter knowledge, consequently, cannot judge whether they have given an approvable account or not. Findings from the studies show that the school context with its explicit stipulations of assignments and <b>implicit</b> <b>request</b> for expressing oneself in your own words frames the learning and creates conditions for how the technology is used and understood. The results indicate that animated models of scientific concepts risk inferring misconceptions if students are left on their own with interpreting information from the learning material. Despite the detected problems of students‘ interpretations of the described phenomena, the results indicate that animated learning material can proffer an exploitable resource in science education. Such a prospect is the ability of animation to engage students in discussions of the subject and to make them recognise otherwise unobservable phenomena...|$|E
40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{investigates the}} autobiographical code in Antjie Krog's poetical oeuvre, spanning from 1970 to the present. Krog's poetry collections may {{be read as}} offering life writing through poetry, while the prose works mostly present the reader {{with a mixture of}} autobiographical fact plus creative reworkings of fact and fiction. Even though her 10 volumes of poetry follow her biological development from young girl to grandmother, uncertainty still exists about about where truth ends and fiction begins in this poet and autobiographer's interwoven tapestry of multiple and varied perspectives. Furthermore, autobiographical (as utilised and adapted in Krog's oeuvre, in combination with the conventioans from other genres), offers a variety of creatively innovative, experimental strategies and possibilities exploited adroitly by Krog. Reading her poetry with the focus on autobiographical markers leads to another, mostly untapped, dimension of interpretation. This literary approach is {{in stark contrast to the}} approach prescibed by N. P. van Wyk Louw in "Die 'mens' agter die boek" ["The 'Person' behind the Book] (1956), in which he states clearly that a text should be interpreted as not "about the human behind the text". To a large extent Krog as poet is inviting the reader to consciously break the taboo that Louw placed on the reader intent on "searching the actual person behind the text". My hypothesis is that in Krog's poetry there is a distinct interrelationship between the perceptions, experiences and sensual impressions of the lyrical "I" in the poems and that of the authobiographical "I" writing. It would be irresponsible to declare the poet and the speaker as one and the same, but in instances where the poet purposefully integrates autobiographical elements into her poems, she is implicitly requesting the reader to interpret her work in this way. This fictive and <b>implicit</b> <b>request</b> is referred to by Philippe Lejeune as the autobiographical poet. Krog's poetry can be divided into four categories: "direct autobiographical", "indirect autobiographical", "universal" and "general" poems. The first category involves criteria that are linked to the poet, such as the use of the names, initials and dates. Indirect autobiographical poems can be read against the background of knowledge (previously published information) about the poet. Poetry with no apparent autobiographical element, but with universal themes such as love, loss and transience, fall into the third category of "universal" poetry. If poems do not fit into the mentioned categories, they are deemed "general"...|$|E

When asked DYK/R questions containing an <b>implicit</b> wh- question <b>requesting</b> information, children often provided unelaborated “Yes” responses.

When DYK/R questions contained an implicit yes/no question, unelaborated “Yes” or “No” responses could be responding to the explicit or the implicit questions resulting in referentially ambiguous responses. Children often provided referentially ambiguous responses and attorneys usually failed to disambiguate children’s answers. Although pragmatic failure following DYK/R wh- questions decreased with age, the likelihood of referential ambiguity following DYK/R yes/no questions did not.

In this legal system, the spouses will have rights and responsibilities relating to each other following the conclusion of the marriage contract; however, since the wife does have economic independence, she is liable to receive wage and remuneration in lieu of what she does as per the <b>implicit</b> or explicit <b>request</b> of her husband. Taking advantage of the wife’s work without paying her wage causes damage and harm to her and according to the rule of prohibition of detriment, the vindicator is obliged to pay the wage. Additionally, under certain circumstances, the wife is entitled to receive an amount of money called matrimony donation. On the other hand, the wife is entitled to have a job; however, it is not her responsibility, so it is possible that she prefers to work at home instead of working outside and in this context, job is considered to have a general meaning which should be protected. In the present article, we investigate the issue of wage from the viewpoint of jurisprudence and law figuring out in which cases the wife is entitled to receive wage and matrimony donation. For example, the question is whether she is entitled to receive wage once the guardianship of the child is entrusted to her. Although the woman has rights and responsibilities in the family, having a job, including one at home or outside are not among her obligations and therefore she is entitled to receive wage...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 802. 15. 4 Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocol}} is an {{enabling technology}} for time sensitive {{wireless sensor networks}} thanks to its Guaranteed-Time Slot (GTS) mechanism in the beacon-enabled mode. However, the protocol only supports explicit GTS allocation, i. e. a node allocates a number of time slots in each superframe for exclusive use. The limitation of this explicit GTS allocation is that GTS resources may quickly disappear, since a maximum of seven GTSs can be allocated in each superframe, preventing other nodes to benefit from guaranteed service. Moreover, the GTSs may be only partially used, resulting in wasted bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes i-GAME, an implicit GTS Allocation Mechanism in beacon-enabled IEEE 802. 15. 4 networks. The allocation is based on <b>implicit</b> GTS allocation <b>requests,</b> {{taking into account the}} traffic specifications and the delay requirements of the flows. The i-GAME approach enables the use of a GTS by multiple nodes, while all their (delay, bandwidth) requirements are still satisfied. For that purpose, we propose an admission control algorithm that enables to decide whether to accept a new GTS allocation request or not, based not only on the remaining time slots, but also on the traffic specifications of the flows, their delay requirements and the available bandwidth resources. We show that our proposal improves the bandwidth utilization compared to the explicit allocation used in the IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol standard. We also present some practical considerations for the implementation of i-GAME, ensuring backward compatibility with the IEEE 801. 5. 4 standard with only minor add-ons.

When operating in beacon-enabled mode, this protocol allows nodes with real-time requirements to allocate Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) in the contention-free period. The protocol natively supports explicit GTS allocation, i. e. a node allocates a number of time slots in each superframe for exclusive use. The limitation of this explicit GTS allocation is that GTS resources may quickly disappear, since a maximum of seven GTSs can be allocated in each superframe, preventing other nodes to benefit from guaranteed service. Moreover, the GTS may be underutilized, resulting in wasted bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes i-GAME, an implicit GTS Allocation Mechanism in beacon-enabled IEEE 802. 15. 4 networks. The allocation is based on <b>implicit</b> GTS allocation <b>requests,</b> {{taking into account the}} traffic specifications and the delay requirements of the flows.

40|$|Modified output, second {{language}} (L 2) learners' reformulation {{of their own}} utterances, has been attracting researchers' interest as {{an important component of}} learner interactions, and as a manifestation of interlanguage development and psycholinguistic processing. The output hypothesis (Swain, 1985, 1993, 1995, 2005) claims that the act of production constitutes {{part of the process of}} L 2 learning in terms of noticing, hypothesis testing and metalinguistic functions. This hypothesis has been used as a theoretical framework to investigate the relationship between modified output and L 2 learning (e. g., McDonough, 2001, 2005; Nobuyoshi Ellis, 1993; O'Relly, Flatiz, Kromrey, 2001; Takashima Ellis, 1999). However, the empirical evidence from these studies does not yet appear to confirm unequivocally that the production of modified output facilitates L 2 learning. The present study further explored the impact of modified output on L 2 learning, by means of an experimental pre-test, post-test and delayed-post design. The production of modified output was triggered by one type of <b>implicit</b> feedback, clarification <b>requests.</b> The data were collected from 28 undergraduate students who were learning Japanese as a foreign language. The target linguistic feature was the negation of adjectives in Japanese, and a total of 1, 011 negations were elicited and analysed. The impact of modified output on L 2 learning was measured in two different aspects of potential outcomes of modified output (i. e., grammatical accuracy and interlanguage development). In addition, the study investigated whether the non-targetlike forms which participants previously modified were then produced in the subsequent situations of use. The output hypothesis was originally framed in terms of the relationship between output and grammatical accuracy, but the findings of the current study suggest that production of modified output in response to clarification requests may facilitate the progress of interlanguage development towards targetlike use even when its immediate impact on grammatical accuracy may not be observed. Therefore, the present study lends at least partial support to the claim of the output hypothesis. The results did not clearly demonstrate whether or not production of modified output might sensitise learners to avoid the use of the same non-targetlike form that they have previously modified. This indicates a possibility of the limited role of production of modified output in L 2 learning, and suggests that the follow-up feedback to learners' modified output may be necessary to maximise the impact of modified output in facilitating L 2 learning...|$|R
40|$|Aim Considering the {{prevalence}} of psychological diseases {{and the number of}} people who receive some kind of psychological or psychotherapeutic care, we found that there is a need of psychological support which is not expressed by the population or not totally fulfilled. As psychological services are not always reimbursed by the National Health Service (they are provided freely only to ad hoc cases) economic barriers would probably be a reasons that can preclude the access to this kind of services. Moreover, population should have the opportunity to access to a service provided in easily accessible locations diffused all around the city and where it is easy to communicate about health issues. The “Psychologist in the neighborhood” project is developed by Catholic University of Sacred Heart, in cooperation with Health Department of Milan and two Chemists' Associations and is an attempt to intercept a part of these requests, began in February 2009. The project allows anyone to book a free psychological counseling cycle in 23 chemists in Milan, directed to the understanding and the management of psychological diseases and to the enhancement of well-being. The service provides, after a first evaluation interview, the opportunity to benefit of a small cycle of free psychological counseling (5 or 6 meetings). Depending to the nature of the needs these cycles can be sufficient to solve the issues or may be used to re-address the need to the most appropriate location (local services such as hospitals or centers for the treatment of addictions). This service is available half-a-day per week in each chemist. Potential users can ask to the chemist to meet a psychologist for an interview in a dedicated location inside the pharmacy. Our aim was to evaluate the requests made by patients who underwent this new service, to compare psychological and demographical characteristics with those from general population and to analyze the preliminary results of interventions made in chemistry.
