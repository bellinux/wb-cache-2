50|$|In 2009, {{president}} Igor Smirnov {{appointed a}} constitutional commission, which has proposed some controversial constitutional changes. The stated {{purpose of the}} new constitution is to harmonize Transnistrian legislation with that of its main <b>guarantor</b> <b>state,</b> Russia. Among the proposed changes is {{the introduction of a}} bicameral legislature (of which the lower house is to be elected and the upper house to be appointed) and the abolition of elections for rural administrations. An official draft was published on 11 September 2009. Smirnov sent the draft to parliament on 23 October. A referendum was planned for 24 January 2010, but the proposal failed in parliament on 18 November. The draft is now to be amended once more.|$|E

Although recent talks in Switzerland failed to deliver a breakthrough, negotiations continue, and hope survives.

5000|$|This {{impression}} made by Shultz {{was false}} - though mixed signals were sent by various US officials at and around {{time of the}} summit, Reagan could not agree to stop arms shipments immediately [...] In late 1987, when this US commitment was conveyed to the Soviet Union, negotiations came to a halt, but proceeded tentatively as the White House and Department of State continued to make contradictory statements on the issue. The issue dissipated when the Department of State suggested that an immediate cessation of US military aid could occur if the Soviets did the same (prior, the US had agreed to an asymmetric cessation of aid, whereby the USSR {{would be allowed to}} continue supporting Kabul). On February 8 1988, the Soviet leadership to announce a conditional date for the beginning of the military withdrawal (which the United States had insisted on for years) in an attempt to encourage the US to compromise on ceasing military shipments. This announcement failed to change the American position on shipments, and simultaneously decreased Soviet bargaining power at the negotiations. Nevertheless, Gorbachev decided that [...] "it was desirable to withdraw within the framework of an international agreement, however flawed, rather than to proceed independently. [...] "We weren't thinking only of Afghanistan," [...] recalled Vadim Zagladin. [...] "There were many processes taking place at that time. The INF agreement on missiles in Europe was particularly important, and all of these things were interconnected."' This factor complicated convincing Najibullah to agree to the Geneva Accords, but he was eventually placated by Soviet promises to dramatically expand aid and assistance measures post-withdrawal. Interestingly, although the USA was not bound under the Geneva Accords to cease its military aid, Pakistan (through which this aid flowed) was obligated to prevent cross-border armament flows to Afghanistan (Kalinovsky 149). On April 14 1988 the Geneva Accords were signed between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the USSR and US acting as <b>guarantors,</b> <b>stating</b> provisions for the withdrawal of Soviet forces and mutual non-interference between Pakistan and Afghanistan.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{suggested}} article is to analyze the ethno-linguo-conflictogenity {{of the modern world}} based on desharmonizing environment of globalization phenomenon in such migrant-capacious and ethnically complex regions, as Tatarstan and Tyumen Region. Today we observe a tendency for blending of dissimilar elements not only in the society, but also in the psychic of a definite person. The authors suggest the ethno-linguo-propaedeutics to solve the stabilization problems in complex polyethnic regions. By the example of the Tatarstan Republic and Tyumen Region, the authors show the definite ways to implement the linguistic and national safety. Separate moments of the studied problem were reflected to some extent in the works of culture experts, sociologists, politologists, philosophers, philologers, psychologists and pedagogues. However, in these materials, the study problems of the linguo-propaedeutics, as a <b>guarantor</b> of <b>state</b> integrity, were either not considered at all, or were presented fragmentarily, without any attempts to analyze it thoroughly. The suggested work presents an attempt to solve these problems in a complex approach. The authors reasonably prove {{that there is a need}} in a new approach to analyze the preventive problems of ethnic conflicts, based on linguistic transformation methods of mental space of the linguistic personality. The suggested new construct "poly-linguo-cultural linguistic personality " is developed by the authors based on the analysis of speech behavio...|$|R

50|$|The 1991 Constitution {{enshrined}} {{the return}} to democracy {{after the fall of}} the Communist regime. The draft was composed by a committee of parliamentarians and constitutional law specialists; was approved by Parliament, meeting as a Constituent Assembly, by a vote of 414 to 95 on 21 November 1991, being published in Monitorul Oficial the same day; and was approved by referendum on 8 December 1991, with 77.3% voting in favour. The 1991 Constitution contains 7 titles and 152 articles. Romania is defined as a “national, sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible state”. The form of government is the republic, the president having up to two four-year terms. He represents the Romanian state in domestic and foreign relations, ensures obedience to the constitution and the proper functioning of state institutions, and is the <b>guarantor</b> of the <b>state’s</b> independence, unity and integrity. Parliament is “the supreme representative organ of the Romanian people and the sole lawmaking authority”; it is bicameral (Chamber of Deputies and Senate) and elected for four years. After the prime minister is named by the president, Parliament validates the composition and programme of the Government and can dismiss it following a motion of censure.

40|$|The goal of bachelor´s {{work is to}} {{describe}} the situation regarding the human resources in the county Prachatice and evaluate this problem from the employment office´s point of view. The basic problem is to utilize effectively the labour force related to free human resources, mainly registered in the employment office. In the bachelor´s work it is particularly pursued the comparison and the utilization of these free human resources. The bachelor´s work {{is divided into two}} main parts. The first part is theoretical and its intent is to explain the important notions regarding the employment. The attention is particulary pursued to the risk groups on labor market. The second part is practical and it is directed to the analysis of situations connected with employment and human resources in the county Prachatice. This part is strongly statistical in order to achieve a good transparency. In this part there is the connection with the theoretical part through the risk groups of the unemployed. At the end of practical part there are some suggestions regarding the utilization of human resources and the support of the employment rate. The result of this work is the maping of human resources development in the county Prachatice. There is also mention the further possible solutions of these problems on regional and state level.

40|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} a strong {{international}} consensus {{on the fact that the}} participation of resident communities is one of the conditions for successful MPA (Marine Protected Area) governance. Thus, this thesis aims to contribute to this emerging debate on MPA governance through reflections about the experience of a conservation project implemented by an international NGO (WWF WMPAO) in collaboration with the State and the local populations in Joal-Fadiouth, with a view to identify the catalysts social factors. The results show that the objectives of the MPA project are not purely local; they are strongly influenced by a global standard as well as regional and national dynamics. Thus, the MPA is much more seen as a conservation tool, whith sanctuarization as philosophical and conceptual basis. This logic of action has led to a real discrepancy between the original objectives and the outcomes in daily practice in the field. The victory of "sanctuarization" on local development, despite discourses based on a constructive approach of the integration paradigm, gave rise to tensions and multiple repulsive reactions and claims in relation to local territorial rights. And in this respect, MPA is a “reserve with reservation”: it refers, on the one hand to a "sanctuarized" space and, on the other, to an increasingly challenged social acceptance in relationship to local territorial dynamics. This thesis has shown, through three case studies, the real potential of co-management regimes, which main catalyst factors are, but not limited to, the setting in the core of the process of actors with real decision-making powers and responsibilities, of information and awareness raising, of financial incentives to overcome the limitations, of integration of scientific expertise to endogenous knowledge, of support of the State and its decentralized services, and of the strengthening of local capacities [...] . Those co-management experiences offer real additional strategic options to the MPA tool in a global approach to fisheries governance and territorialized development. However, the results of the thesis show also the limits of participatory management induced by the projects (obligation of results short time-frame) through the "formatting of local institutions of governance" especially a Management Committee, which is struggling to meet its "excessive" responsibilities in light of its very limited resources. This committee has become a "local brokerage arena" which captures and capitalizes on co-management resources and means; which tends to move the real power towards "intermediary actors" who serve as populations/State interface or even "exploit" the administration officials. This thesis has also highlighted the paradox of the State that justifies and provides legitimacy to local co-management processes through legal institutionalization, but does not mobilize the legal, financial, human and logistical resources required to guarantee and secure the implementation of the agreements reached between the different actors. It has more of a posture of an organizing State than that of a <b>State</b> <b>guarantor</b> of management agreements...|$|R
