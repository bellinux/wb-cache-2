2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now {{we have to move}} on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to go and I think <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E

60|$|On the 6th July, we {{left the}} Villa, with our {{enormous}} luggage, and took our departure from Southampton by the noon train. The main street of Southampton, though <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>pretty</b> fresh and bright, must be really antique, there being a great many projecting windows, in the old-time style, and these make the vista of the street very picturesque. I {{have no doubt that}} I missed seeing many things more interesting than the few that I saw. Our journey to London was without any remarkable incident, and at the Waterloo station we found one of Mr. Bennoch's clerks, under whose guidance we took two cabs for the East Kent station at London Bridge, and there railed to Blackheath, where we arrived in the afternoon.|$|E
