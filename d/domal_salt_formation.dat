The samples were taken from deep rock formations under consideration as possible sites for a nuclear waste repository - the rock salt from a <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> <b>formation</b> at Avery Island, Louisiana, and the quartz monzonite from the Climax Stock, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. The testing temperature and pressures are meant to bracket conditions expected in the repository. In both rock types, the thermal properties show a strong dependence upon temperature and a weak or non-dependence upon confining pressure. Thermal conductivity and diffusivity both decrease with increasing temperature in approximately linear fashion for samples which have not been previously heated. At 50 MPa in both rocks this decrease closely matches the measured or expected intrinsic (crack-free) behavior of the material.

40|$|Salt caverns can {{be formed}} through {{solution}} mining in the bedded or <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> {{that are found}} in many states. Salt caverns have traditionally been used for hydrocarbon storage, but caverns have also been used to dispose of some types of wastes. This paper {{provides an overview of}} several years of research by Argonne National Laboratory on the feasibility and legality of using salt caverns for disposing of nonhazardous oil field wastes (NOW) and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), the risk to human populations from this disposal method, and the cost of cavern disposal. Costs are compared between the four operating US disposal caverns and other commercial disposal options located in the same geographic area as the caverns. Argonne's research indicates that disposal of NOW into salt caverns is feasible and, in most cases, would not be prohibited by state agencies (although those agencies may need to revise their wastes management regulations). A risk analysis of several cavern leakage scenarios suggests that the risk from cavern disposal of NOW and NORM wastes is below accepted safe risk thresholds. Disposal caverns are economically competitive with other disposal options...|$|R

In the past few years, four facilities in the US have been permitted to dispose nonhazardous oil field wastes in salt caverns. Several other disposal caverns have been permitted in Canada and Europe. This report evaluates the possibility that adverse human health effects could result from exposure to contaminants released from the caverns in <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> used for nonhazardous oil field waste disposal. The evaluation assumes normal operations but considers the possibility of leaks in cavern seals and cavern walls during the post-closure phase of operation. In this assessment, several steps were followed to identify possible human health risks. At the broadest level, these steps include identifying a reasonable set of contaminants of possible concern, identifying how humans could be exposed to these contaminants, assessing the toxicities of these contaminants, estimating their intakes, and characterizing their associated human health risks. The contaminants of concern for the assessment are benzene, cadmium, arsenic, and chromium. These were selected as being components of oil field waste and having a likelihood to remain in solution for a long enough time to reach a human receptor...|$|R
40|$|With renewed {{interest}} in disposal of heat-generating waste in bedded or <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> <b>formations,</b> scoping {{analyses were conducted to}} estimate rates of waste package vertical movement. Vertical movement is found to result from thermal expansion, from upward creep or heave of the near-field salt, and from downward buoyant forces on the waste package. A two-pronged analysis approach was used, with thermal-mechanical creep modeling, and coupled thermal-viscous flow modeling. The thermal-mechanical approach used well-studied salt constitutive models, while the thermal-viscous approach represented the salt as a highly viscous fluid. The Sierra suite of coupled simulation codes was used for both approaches. The waste package in all simulations was a right-circular cylinder with the density of steel, in horizontal orientation. A time-decaying heat generation function was used to represent commercial spent fuel with typical burnup and 50 -year age. Results from the thermal-mechanical base case showed approximately 27 cm initial uplift of the package, followed by gradual relaxation closely following the calculated temperature history. A similar displacement history was obtained with the package density set equal to that of salt. The slight difference in these runs is attributable to buoyant displacement (sinking) and is on the order of 1 mm in 2, 000 years. Without heat generation the displacement stabilizes at a fraction of millimeter after a few hundred years. Results from thermal-viscous model were similar, except that the rate of sinking was constant after cooldown, at approximately 0. 15 mm per 1, 000 yr. In summary, all calculations showed vertical movement on the order of 1 mm or less in 2, 000 yr, including calculations using well-established constitutive models for temperature-dependent salt deformation. Based on this finding, displacement of waste packages in a salt repository is not a significant repository performance issue...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale methane {{releases}} in <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> mines {{have resulted}} in ignitions and mine fatalities as recently as 1979. Several past studies have implied that hazardous methane occurrences in U. S. salt domes are distributed neither uniformly nor randomly, but are geologically controlled and potentially predictable. A first step by the Bureau of Mines in addressing the problem of methane in <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> mines required {{development of a new}} test to determine volumes of gases in solid salt samples. This report considers the results achieved when 80 <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> samples were tested for gas content by dissolution in a controlled atmosphere chamber. Criteria were organized to delineate salt types based on geological occurrence. The presence of higher hydrocarbons was most common in samples containing larger quantities of methane. The presence of higher hydrocarbons appears to be useful in detecting methane hazards where some methane may be lost before gas content testing.

40|$|There {{have existed}} {{for some time}} {{relatively}} sparse creep databases {{for a number of}} <b>domal</b> <b>salts.</b> Although all of these data were analyzed at the time they were reported, to date {{there has not been a}} comprehensive, overall evaluation within the same analysis framework. Such an evaluation may prove of value. The analysis methodology is based on the Multimechanism Deformation (M-D) description of salt creep and the corresponding model parameters determined from conventional creep tests. The constitutive model of creep wss formulated through application of principles involved in micromechanical modeling. It was possible, at minimum, to obtain the steady state parameters of the creep model from the data on the <b>domal</b> <b>salts.</b> When this was done, the creep of the <b>domal</b> <b>salts,</b> as compared to the well-defined Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) bedded clean salt, was either essentially identical to, or significantly harder (more creep resistant) than WIPP <b>salt.</b> Interestingly, the <b>domal</b> <b>salts</b> form two distinct groups, either sofl or hard, where the difference is roughly a factor often in creep rate between the twcl groups. As might be expected, this classification corresponds quite well to the differences in magnitude of effective creep volume losses of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) caverns as determined by the CAVEMAN cavern pressure history analysis, depending upon the specific dome or region within the dome.

40|$|Use of Gulf Coast salt domes for {{construction}} of very large storage caverns by solution mining has grown significantly {{in the last several}} decades. In fact, a nationally important Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage occurs in large cavern arrays in some of these domes. Although caverns have been operated economically for these many years, these caverns have a range of relatively poorly understood behaviors, involving creep closure fluid loss and damage from salt falls. It is certainly possible to postulate that many of these behaviors stem from geomechanical or deformational aspects of the salt response. As a result, a method of correlating the cavern response to mechanical creep behavior as determined in the laboratory could be of considerable importance. Recently, detailed study of the creep response of <b>domal</b> <b>salts</b> has cast some insight into the influence of different salt origins on cavern behavior. The study used a simple graphical analysis of the limited non-steady state data to give a bound, or an approach to steady state, as an estimate of the steady state behavior of a given <b>domal</b> <b>salt.</b> This permitted the analysis of sparse creep databases for <b>domal</b> <b>salts.</b> It appears that a shortcoming of the steady state analysis was in masking some of the salt material differences. In an attempt to overcome the steady state analysis shortcomings, a method was developed based on the integration of the Multimechanism-Deformation (M-D) creep constitutive model to fit the transient response. This integration process essentially permits definition of the material sensitive parameters of the model, while those parameters that are either constants or material insensitive parameters are fixed independently. The transient analysis method has proven more sensitive to differences in the creep characteristics and has provided a way of defining different behaviors within a given dome. Creep characteristics, as defined by the transient analysis of the creep rate, are related quantitatively to the volume loss creep rate of the caverns. This type of understanding of the domal material creep response already has pointed to the possibility of establishing various distinct material spines within a given dome. Furthermore, if the creep databases for <b>domal</b> <b>salts</b> can be expanded, one could expect additional definition of domal geology and structure...|$|R

The results obtained are comparable to results in Polish <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> mines, in terms of occluded gas volumes per mass of rock salt. The notable difference between the Louisiana and Polish occluded gas mixtures is in the relative proportions of the individual gas species.

40|$|Salt storage {{projects}} in <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> {{are concerned with}} the position of the salt {{and the nature of the}} adjacent strata generally to a depth of about 4, 000 - 5, 000 feet. Salt diapirs which have reached this depth range are geologically dynamic and the position of the salt is controlled by the interplay of three different processes (upward salt movement, salt dissolution by ground water, and subsidence of the base of the salt). The interaction of these processes determines whether the salt stock (or its various components) is in an active, passive, or dormant stage. Each stage is related to geologic processes associated with salt movement and dissolution, cap rock formation and alteration, and the deposition and deformation of surrounding sediments. While these processes are commonly thought of at rates measured in geologic time (i. e., 1000 years or more), they may have a significant impact on storage projects (i. e., cavern closure and casing failure) over a period of 10 - 20 years or less.

40|$|The {{experimentally}} determined creep {{responses of}} a number of <b>domal</b> <b>salts</b> have been reported in, the literature. Some of these creep results were obtained using standard (conventional) creep tests. However, more typically, the creep data have come from multistage creep tests, where the number of specimens available for testing was small. An incremental test uses abrupt changes in stress and temperature to produce several time increments (stages) of different creep conditions. Clearly, the ability to analyze these limited data and to correlate them with each other could be of considerable potential value in establishing the mechanical characteristics of salt domes, both generally and specifically. In any analysis, it is necessary to have a framework of rules to provide consistency. The basis for the framework is the Multimechanism-Deformation (M-D) constitutive model. This model utilizes considerable general knowledge of material creep deformation to supplement specific knowledge of the material response of salt. Because the creep of salt is controlled by just a few micromechanical mechanisms, regardless of the origin of the salt, certain of the material parameters are values that can be considered universal to salt. Actual data analysis utilizes the methodology developed for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) program, and the response of a bedded pure WIPP salt as the baseline for comparison of the <b>domal</b> <b>salts.</b> Creep data from Weeks Island, Bryan Mound, West Hackberry, Bayou Choctaw, and Big Hill salt domes, which are all sites of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage caverns, were analyzed, as were data from the Avery Island, Moss Bluff, and Jennings salt domes. The analysis permits the parameter value sets for the <b>domal</b> <b>salts</b> to be determined in terms of the M-D model with various degrees of completeness. In turn this permits detailed numerical calculations simulating cavern response. Where the set is incomplete because of the sparse database, reasonable assumptions permit the set to be completed. From the analysis, two distinct response groups were evident, with the salts of one group measurably more creep resistant than the other group. Interestingly, these groups correspond well with the indirectly determined creep closure of the SPR storage caverns, a correlation that probably should be expected. Certainly, the results suggest a simple laboratory determination of the creep characteristics of a salt material from a dome site can indicate the relative behavior of any potential cavern placed within that dome...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} recent reviews, observations, {{and analyses}} {{believed to be}} imperative {{to our understanding of}} the recent two million cubic feet salt fall event in Big Hill Cavern 103, one of the caverns of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The fall was the result of one or more stress driven mechanical instabilities, the origins of which are discussed in the report. The work has lead to important conclusions concerning the engineering and operations of the caverns at Big Hill. Specifically, Big Hill, being the youngest SPR site, was subjected to state-of-the-art solutioning methods to develop nominally well-formed, right-circular cylindrical caverns. Examination of the pressure history records indicate that operationally all Big Hill SPR caverns have been treated similarly. Significantly, new three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging methods, applied to old (original) and more recent sonar survey data, have provided much more detailed views of cavern walls, roofs, and floors. This has made possible documentation of the presence of localized deviations from ''smooth'' cylindrical cavern walls. These deviations are now recognized as isolated, linear and/or planar features in the original sonar data (circa early 1990 s), which persist to the present time. These elements represent either sites of preferential leaching, localized spalling, or a combination of the two. Understanding the precise origin of these phenomena remains a challenge, especially considering, in a historical sense, the <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> at Big Hill was believed to be well-characterized. However, significant inhomogeneities in the <b>domal</b> <b>salt</b> that may imply abnormalities in leaching were not noted. Indeed, any inhomogeneities were judged inconsequential to the solution-engineering methods at the time, and, by the same token, to the approaches to modeling the rock mass geomechanical response. The rock mass was treated as isotropic and homogeneous, which in retrospect, appears to have been an over simplification. This analysis shows there are possible new opportunities regarding completing an appropriate site characterization for existing operating cavern fields in the SPR, as well as expansion of current sites or development of new sites. Such characterization should first be consistent with needs identified by this report. Secondly, the characterization needs to satisfy the input requirements of the 3 -D solutioning calculational methods being developed, together with 3 -D geomechanical analyses techniques which address deformation of a salt rock mass that contains inhomogeneities. It seems apparent that focusing on these important areas could preclude occurrence of unexpected events that would adversely impact the operations of SPR...|$|R
