5|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} attempting to explain his disappearance: that <b>he</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide,</b> was murdered by his Persian or Turkish enemies, or arrested and exiled to Siberia by the Special Corps of Gendarmes, among others.

Writer Axel Bakunts put forward the theory that Abovian was in Western Europe engulfed in the Revolutions of 1848.|$|E

Its subject is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce Bechdel.

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when <b>he</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS {{ceased to}} exist. Numerous {{members of the}} SS, many of them still {{committed}} Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an internment camp near Lüneburg, <b>he</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide</b> by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the International Military Tribunal in 1945–46.|$|E
5|$|Late in World War II, Hitler charged Himmler {{with the}} command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula; he failed to achieve his {{assigned}} objectives and Hitler replaced him in these posts.

5|$|Savary's {{return to}} port {{marked the end of}} the last attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of Wolfe Tone himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from Hoche at Buncrana. Tone was charged with treason and sentenced to death, though <b>he</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide</b> in Dublin before the sentence could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|After the assassination, Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus (Octavian). Along with Marcus Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and <b>he</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide</b> with his lover, Cleopatra. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of Augustus ("Exalted One"). He was convinced that only a single strong ruler could restore order in Rome.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. <b>He</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide</b> on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
