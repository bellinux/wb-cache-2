40|$|Paper Presentation: no. A 4 - 2 B 1 OBJECTIVES: Taxis are an {{important}} transportation mode {{but they tend to}} circulate around a city to search for customers. The circulation activity occupies spare road spaces and worsens traffic congestion and air quality. Numerous studies have been conducted to attempt modeling the route choices of drivers based on taxi GPS data. They can be used to model the local movements of drivers within a zone. However, most of these efforts have been put on modeling the route choices of occupied taxi drivers with a known destination and these studies did not model vacant taxi drivers' route choice behavior for finding the next customers. Without modeling the local customer-search movements of vacant taxis, effective and appropriate taxi regulation policies cannot be established to tackle the traffic congestion and air pollution problems. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: This paper proposes a cell-based model to predict local customer-search movements of vacant taxi drivers, which incorporates the modeling principles of the logit-based search model and the <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>model.</b> The logit-based modeling concept is used to handle multi-directional, discrete search choices for vacant taxi drivers and the <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>model</b> is reformulated and incorporated into the logit-based search model to capture the cumulative probability of successfully meeting a customer in each direction of customer-search. The proposed model assumes that vacant taxi drivers do not have clear destinations in customer-search after they drop off their preceding customers, but they travel towards an area with a high probability of meeting a customer. The local customer-search movements were extracted from the global positioning system data of 460 Hong Kong urban taxis and inputted into a cell-based taxi operating network to calibrate the model and validate the modeling concepts. EXPECTED RESULTS: The model results reveal that the taxi drivers' local search decisions are significantly affected by the (cumulative) probability of successfully picking up a customer along the search route, and that the drivers do not search their customers under the random walk principle. The proposed model helps predict the effects of the implementation of the policies in adjusting the taxi fleet size and the changes in passenger demand on the customer-search distance and time of taxi drivers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a flexible gravity-opportunities model for trip distribution in which standard {{forms of the}} gravity and opportunities models are obtained as special cases of a general opportunities (GO) model. Hence the question of choice between gravity or opportunities approaches is decided empirically and statistically by restrictions on parameters which control the global functional form of the trip distribution mechanism. The test for the gravity model is shown to be equivalent to {{a test of the}} IIA axiom where alternatives are destinations. The notational dichotomy between the two approaches is resolved by employing ordered trip matrices and transformations to permit row and column sum constraints to be applied. These constraints, often interpreted in various ways, are treated as normalisation terms and are therefore not strictly part of the form of the model. Doubly constrained, singly constrained and unconstrained versions of both models are developed throughout. A key step in the integration is the specification of an opportunity function which has as arguments destination-attribute variables such population, income or some other measure of opportunities and generalized cost/impedance-type variables relating origin and destination. This device obviates the mutual exclusiveness ordinarily required of these two sets of variables. The opportunity function is incorporated into a general proportionality factor which is defined by the difference in functions of cumulative opportunities; the latter are subjected to a convex combination of direct and inverse Box-Cox transformations. Different values of the parameters controlling these transformations generate contrasting families of models, notably the exponential and logarithmic intervening opportunities models and the gravity model. All models are shown to be embedded in a transformed triangular region over which likelihood function, response surface or simultaneous confidence interval contours may be plotted. These generalised gravity-opportunity concepts are applied to two well-known models: direct demand multimodal travel demand models, and the estimation of the OD matrix from link volumes. The second case is estimated empirically and here it is shown that a significant improvement is obtained over the gravity model, which is rejected, along with the logarithmic <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>model,</b> in favour of a more general direct opportunities version. ...|$|E
40|$|Taxi {{services}} play {{an important}} role in transportation systems by providing 24 -hour door-to-door services. However, taxis contribute significantly to congestion and air pollution problems, especially when excessive taxis circulate on roads searching for customers. It is thus necessary and important to properly model how taxis navigate on urban road networks in order to establish effective taxi regulation policies to mitigate these problems. Various taxi network models have been developed to investigate the consequences of a variety of taxi regulation policies. However, very few studies have sought to validate the models based on the real-world data. This thesis uses the global positioning system (GPS) data from 460 Hong Kong urban taxis for calibrations and validations of the proposed search models. At first, the zone choices of vacant taxi drivers in search of customers are modeled to determine the significant factors that influence their search decisions and to demonstrate the variations in their customer-search behavior at different times of day. Then, the sequential zone choices of vacant taxi drivers traveling to adjacent zones of their current locations for customers are further modeled to estimate the search paths taken to reach the customers from the zones visited sequence. Other than revealing the zonal distribution of vacant taxis, a cell-based logit-opportunity model, which incorporates the modeling principles of logit-based search model and <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>model,</b> is also formulated in this thesis to predict the local cruising movements of vacant taxis, and to estimate the required circulation distance and time to reach a customer. Based on the contributions of these search models, a two-stage modeling approach is consequently introduced in this thesis to consider both the zonal and local taxi customer-search decisions simultaneously. The first stage problem estimates the zonal distribution of vacant taxis and the second stage problem depicts the local search movements of vacant taxis in a cell-based network within the chosen zone in the first stage. The proposed model formulation is found to offer a great improvement in prediction accuracy on the zonal distribution of vacant taxis to the existing logit-based search models. The two-stage model can also be applied for forecasting the effects of adjusting the fare and fleet size to the vacant taxi trip distribution. Potential taxi policies are investigated and discussed according to the findings, and that provides insights for managing the taxi market of Hong Kong and other international cities with similar urban taxi services provided. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The urban {{development}} of green-field areas requires an assessment against economic, {{social and environmental}} sustainability objectives of which vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) and journey to work patterns by automobile is one important criterion. Current practice in Australia on travel demand forecasting applies strategic land-use and spatial interaction models calibrated {{for the whole of}} the metropolitan area to the proposed urban release area to estimate future VKT, among other travel indicators. This will give misleading results for spatial patterns of traffic in these release areas as demonstrated by previous research.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a flexible, inexpensive, interactive {{computer model}} {{specifically designed to}} act as an aid for planning routes for conventional bus systems in communities with populations between 20, 000 and 250, 000. The characteristics of these communities, the desires of decision makers, the cost and availability of data, and the special problems inherent in route planning are examined and a useful routing model is designed. A computer implementation of the structure of its major component was developed. Usage costs are examined. (An implementation of the entire model has not yet been completed.) The completed model will not replace community leaders or transit managers; instead, it will enable a decision maker to quickly and inexpensively test a potential route or operating decision without actually implementing it. To test the route, the decision maker need only input the operating decision or route choice. The routing model automatically traces the route through the community and estimates whom the route serves, how well, and at what cost. It predicts how many people will use the route, their geographic location, possibly their income distribution, the travel time, wait time, the walking distance they experience, and the operating cost of the route. Based on these estimates, the decision maker can alter any decision and immediately test the new route. In the course of model design, two new demand models are formulated: an alternative logit model for probability estimation or modal split calculations, and an extension of the <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>model</b> for desire prediction or trip generation.

Initially log-linear regression models were calibrated, incorporating a variety of independent variables.

To validate these methods a survey of ultimate trip end locations was carried out on the Rhymney line in South Wales. To give consistency with predictions from trip end models, methods were developed to constrain predicted trip numbers for each flow based on the total trips observed or predicted from origin stations.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} forecast demand from new local railway stations {{it is necessary}} to define the catchment areas which such stations will serve. Most existing forecasting methodologies tend to use relatively simplistic catchment definition methods, usually based on the all-or-nothing allocation of population units to stations and constant distance decay functions. Catchment boundaries in such cases are usually chosen either by approximating observed results from small-scale surveys or by maximising demand model fit across a calibration case study, but {{there is no guarantee that}} such methods reflect actual travel behaviour. However, the UK National Rail Travel Survey (NRTS) provides an extremely large dataset on ultimate trip origins/destinations and station access/egress, which should permit a comprehensive analysis of actual station catchments and therefore allow a generalised procedure for estimating theoretical station catchments to be developed. This paper describes such an analysis, carried out for the North-East and Wales regions of the UK. Firstly, NRTS data was used to assess the accuracy of various theoretical catchment definition methods, including crow-fly distance, road distance and road journey time buffer zones, with both overlapping and discrete boundaries. The results were disaggregated by Network Rail station category to allow variations between station types to be investigated. Extensive descriptive and exploratory statistical analysis of the NRTS data was then carried out. Inter-station variability was assessed, to establish the likelihood of a single generalised catchment boundary being suitable for all stations within a particular category. The relationship between access/egress mode and distance was then explored, along with the relative popularity of different access modes. One of the key aims of the analysis was to investigate station choice decisions, and the station chosen in each case was therefore ranked by access/egress distance from the trip origin/destination. These results were then disaggregated by station category, access distance (to both the nearest station and the station used), the proportion of total journey distance made up by access/egress, and station density. The results from the descriptive analysis were used to inform the development and calibration of station choice models capable of providing catchment population inputs for rail demand models. A range of models at disaggregate and aggregate levels were calibrated for the same case study dataset, including ordinal regression, multinomial logistic regression and <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>models.</b> In addition to their application in demand forecasting, the use of the models to assess abstraction by new stations was also investigated, by running the station choice models in the ‘before’ and ‘after’ situations and comparing the difference in the results. The outputs from the study can inform and enhance PDFH guidance on catchment definition for demand modelling, which is currently extremely basic, as well as forming the basis for guidance on forecasting access mode choice and station choice. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the recent work which has been undertaken on modelling the absolute demand for rail travel has focused on inter-urban trips, meaning that local and suburban travel has been somewhat neglected. This paper describes the development of flow-level absolute demand models based on LENNON ticket sales data for 85 local rail stations in South Wales. A range of log-linear regression models were calibrated on a dataset of 2, 440 flows, incorporating a variety of station-specific and flow-specific independent variables. Subsets of this dataset were used to test models which incorporated measures of intermodal competition {{and the presence of}} <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities.</b> GIS were used extensively in data processing and integration, and allowed flexible station catchment definition methods to be tested, including flow-specific catchments where population units were allocated to stations by minimising total travel time to the destination in question. To allow these methods to be validated a survey to collect information on actual station catchments was carried out on the Rhymney line and the results compared to the theoretical catchments. The flow level model predictions did not correspond with either observed or forecast station trip totals and in an attempt to give consistency between predictions, methods were developed to constrain the number of trips predicted for each flow based on the total trips observed or predicted from origin stations. Constrained flow level predictions were first obtained by using observed trip end totals to scale the results from unconstrained models. This was not entirely successful, so probabilistic trip distribution models were also calibrated using both linear and nonlinear regression.

40|$|International audienceTrip {{distribution}} {{laws are}} basic for the travel demand characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches {{have been considered}} in the last years. One {{of them is the}} so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed {{to be related to the}} population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} few years, a {{significant}} research effort {{has been made to}} understand human mobility patterns, both in the laws governing individual human trajectories [11, 12] and collective movements [6, 13, 14]. In the latter case, the most extensively used models are the gravity model [15, 16] and the more recent radiation model [6]. The gravity model assumes that the number of people travelling between two locations is directly proportional to some power of their population size, and decays as some power of the distance between them. Instead, the radiation model considers human movements as diffusion processes that depend on the population distribution over the space, reproducing Stouffer’s theory of <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> [17]. Both <b>models</b> are static and require some information in order to be adjusted: in the gravity model, parameters are fitted using real mobility data, provided by an independent source; the radiation model, in its original formulation, is parameter-free, but it requires accurate knowledge of the spatial population distribution. Both modelling approaches have been extensively tested, showing advantages and limitations. The gravity model has been successfully used to describe highway flows [18], air-travel [19, 20], commuting [8], and mobile phone calls between cities [21]. However, it has some relevant limitations, as the availability of data for calibration and the lack of a first principle derivation [6, 22]. On the other hand, the radiation model offers very good predictions for commuting patterns between US counties using only population data, but its applicability at different spatial scales has been debated since it does not succeed in capturing commuting inside urban or metropolitan areas [22 – 24] and it has never been used to model long distance travel patterns either.|$|R

30|$|From {{modeling}} perspective a {{great leap}} {{in the understanding}} of human mobility patterns represented the radiation model introduced by Simini et al. [5]. In contrast with earlier models that were phenomenologically argued, the radiation model started from a basic socio-economic optimization assumption and derived a simple and compact formula for commuter fluxes. Relative to the earlier used models the compact result derived in [5] has also the advantage that it is parameter free. When compared however with real commuting and population data, the model contains an undetermined proportionality constant that makes the connection between the population and available job number. In such sense one can argue that this model is a one free parameter model. Other models of similar complexity, built also on realistic assumptions are the population-weighted <b>opportunities</b> <b>model</b> (PWO) [6] and a novel version of it where also memory effects are considered [7].

40|$|In spatial {{interaction}} modelling, trips between {{origins and}} destinations {{within the same}} areal zone have a predominant influence on both {{the value of the}} gravity parameter and on the associated pattern of flows. Despite this, the relevant highly sensitive intrazonal impedance values are usually based on approximate average intrazonal distances or times. This situation has been identified in the literature as the ?self potential? problem. In this paper, integration over continuous space within the origin destination zones is applied to not only compute the intrazonal flows more accurately, but also to determine their influence on calibration {{of the value of the}} gravity parameter itself. In addition, whereas all trips are assumed to have destinations corresponding to nodes of the transport network, interzonal trips, starting from dispersed origins, are assigned shortest path routes to join the interzonal links at efficient intermediate points. In the analysis, further approximations incurred in evaluation of the sets of origin/destination flows between contiguous zones are also identified. The eventual aim is to develop practical ?rules of thumb? for correcting the conventional analysis. Flows between areal zones and facility nodes may occur along several plausible alternative paths, rather than via one abstract ?interzonal? path, as usually considered in conventional spatial interaction models. Such destination/route choice is easy to handle in the relatively uncongested conditions characterizing off-peak discretionary travel. This paper examines facility choice via alternative routes, as well as attempting to discern the influence of ?<b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities?.</b> It is indicated how <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> may influence discretionary travel positively, in contrast to their identified negative influence on the probability of choosing the final destination in journey to work travel.

This provides evidence {{of the role of}} spot markets in determining the pattern of commodity flows. ...|$|R
40|$|A spatial {{interaction}} methodology {{is developed}} for modeling flows in a hierarchical system. A competing and intervening destinations framework is employed to model and predict US state-to-state labor migration. This analysis {{is used to}} assess the importance of geographic variables in explaining variations in regional labor flows. Empirical findings suggest that US labor migration is largely explained by Newtonian and systemic forces [...] size, distance, locational accessibility, and <b>intervening</b> <b>opportunities</b> in a spatial hierarchy. It is also suggested that lagged migration or migrant stock {{is a product of the}} combined effect of these forces. ...|$|R
