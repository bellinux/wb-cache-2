As a container, an amphora {{was supposed to be}} strong, not too <b>heavy,</b> <b>shaped</b> in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, a rim of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base. The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container.|$|R

40|$|In using {{weight and}} diet advisors, people compare {{embodied}} agents with their actual selves {{and with the}} person they want to be: someone with an ideal weight; their ideal selves. In a laboratory and an online experiment, we scrutinized the effects of similarity with and idealness of an embodied agent feature on user involvement with, distance towards, and intentions to use the e-health advisor. The advisor's body size was either similar or dissimilar to the user's actual body size, and had an, according to the user, ideal (slender) or non-ideal (<b>heavier)</b> <b>shape.</b> Results indicated that the factor perceived idealness {{was more important than}} similarity for explaining involvement with, distance towards, and intentions to use the embodied agent, but in an unexpected way. Users regarded the heavier, non-ideal, e-health advisors as more trustworthy, which explained the larger part {{of the variance in the}} level of involvement, distance, and intentions to use a health advisor. Sometimes, it seems better to forget the stereotypical preference and design embodied agents that are not ideal. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Acheulean {{materials}} {{documented in}} FLK West dated c. 1. 7 Ma. {{are the focus}} of the present work. An original techno-functional approach is applied here to analyze the origin of Acheulean tools. According to the results, these tools were employed in different functional contexts in which tasks of different durations that transformed resources with different resistances were carried out. The exploitation of large and resistant resources suggests that the economic mechanism governing the manufacture of these tools was an increase in the demand of the work load. The decision processes underlying the production of these tools have thus an evident functional motivation. However, the presence of a refined handaxe in the studied sample indicates that the design form and production principles of handaxe manufacture were the result of an abrupt emergence rather than a long gradual development. The integration of mechanical and ergonomic investigation in our research has been crucial to explain how a core-and-flake industry gave way to a technology based on the production of large and <b>heavy</b> <b>shaped</b> tools...|$|R

40|$|This memory {{intends to}} bring the {{attention}} on some Sicilian urban areas (Territory of Agrigento – buildings and landscape of the Valley of the Temples) which are very interesting from the historical and architectural point of view. These urban settlements are characterized of buildings that are a remarkable evidence of arts and building techniques of the past. Today these urban settlements are marked by <b>heavy</b> <b>shapes</b> of building decay. This decay is determined by an improper use of them and by an extended absence of maintenance. In order to fill these breaks and to sew up again the urban tissue, it’s necessary to apply interventions of recovery and valorization. These recovery interventions must be able both to safeguard the historical heritage, and to constitute poles of reference and aggregation in the contemporary city. In order to reach this task the memory describes and illustrates some research and methodological experimentation experiences on the “Strategies for recovery and retraining of degraded historical areas”, which were {{carried out by the}} University of the Studies in Palermo and which take part of an important agreement with local regional Institutions. The researches have brought to interesting outcomes (relationships of international research) about studies on strategic process for recovery of the historical buildings in smaller urban centres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article gives a {{comprehensive}} analysis of reduplication in Rotuman (Oceanic). The main reduplication <b>shape</b> is a <b>heavy</b> syllable prefix (e. g., CVC-, CVV-), which we document {{with a list}} of 847 reduplicated words and native speaker elicitation. We argue that the <b>heavy</b> syllable <b>shape</b> is predicted in large part by the phonology of the incomplete phase, a system-wide generalization also requiring heavy syllables. The apparent markedness of the reduplicant thus follows from the phonology of phase and other independently motivated constraints for anti-gemination, under-application, and prosodic faithfulness effects...|$|R

5000|$|The Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck (tank terror) {{gave the}} German infantryman {{the ability to}} destroy any tank on the {{battlefield}} from 50-150 metres with relative ease of use and training (unlike the British PIAT). The Germans made use of large quantities of HEAT ammunition in converted 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 guns from 1942, also fabricating HEAT warheads for the Mistel weapon. These so-called Schwere Hohlladung (<b>heavy</b> <b>shaped</b> charge) warheads were intended for use against heavily armoured battleships. Operational versions weighed nearly two tons and were perhaps the largest HEAT warheads ever deployed. A five-ton version code-named Beethoven was also developed. Meanwhile, the British No. 68 AT rifle grenade was proving to be too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was needed, and this ultimately {{came in the form}} of the [...] "projector, infantry, anti-tank" [...] or PIAT. By 1942, the PIAT had been developed by Major Millis Jefferis. It was a combination of a HEAT warhead with a spigot mortar delivery system. While cumbersome, the weapon allowed British infantry to engage armour at range for the first time. The earlier magnetic hand-mines and grenades required them to approach dangerously near. During World War II the British referred to the Monroe effect as the [...] "cavity effect on explosives".|$|R

The sheets contain 0. 048 holes and a compensating number of electrons per formula unit, making the material a semimetallic superconductor. The results support the presence of two band superconductivity, although a discrepancy in the specific heat is noted.

5000|$|Bots are {{constructed}} with two basic tools: shapes and joints. Shapes include rectangles, circles and triangles. Shapes have different settings, {{such as the}} ability to fixate them to their position, the ability to toggle collision with other shapes (excluding the sandbox), and the ability to alter their density. In IncrediBots, density is a value between 1-30 that can be changed to make the <b>shape</b> lighter or <b>heavier.</b> <b>Shapes</b> actively interact with each other through joints. The types of joints are rotating, sliding and fixed. Fixed joints 'weld' the two shapes together and cannot break. Rotating joints allow for rotational movement, and have a 'motor' that can be enabled. Once enabled, the motor causes rotational movement between the shapes when the user-set key is pressed, or automatically if set to do so. Rotating joints also have a set power and speed (between 1-30), and user-defined upper and lower rotation limits much like a servo motor,these joints can break. They also have a floppy or non-floppy option, which toggles a rotational 'brake'. Sliding joints are similar to 2 dimensional pneumatic pistons. They connect two objects but are unique in that the two objects {{do not have to be}} overlapping, and in that they collide with other shapes and add weight to the objects. Like rotating joints, they have set power and speed (1-30). Sliding joints also have an auto-oscillation setting which makes it expand and contract automatically. A fourth joint, thrusters, were once available only to [...] "IncrediBots Supporters" [...] in the first two games, but is currently a default joint in IncrediBots 3. They simply create a set amount of force in a chosen direction, applying it when the activation key is pressed, or automatically if set. Combined, shapes and joints allow for a huge amount of flexibility in creation.|$|R

This article investigates the effects of rolling friction on various mechanical responses of virtual particle assemblies in simulated triaxial and oedometer tests.

Measurement could appear problematic on a sample with periodical relief structure (e. g. gratings with sub 10 μm periodicity) prepared in hard materials (e. g. silicon), when the structure height is greater than about 500 nm.
