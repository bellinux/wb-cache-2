5|$|A Professional Edition was {{announced}} December 11, 2001, with marketing aimed towards business owners. This version features Norton <b>Intrusion</b> Detection, which intercepts suspicious connections and attacks, {{such as the}} Code Red worm. <b>Intrusion</b> Detection focuses on Windows-based attacks only. Central management is also present in this version. Administrators configure firewall and productivity settings for client computers. Productivity settings allow administrators to block newsgroups, websites, and advertisements. The suite integrates with XP user accounts; settings can be personalized for each user.|$|E
5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} unauthorized network <b>intrusion.</b> A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any <b>intrusion</b> and in an attempt to identify the attacker. Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigations have}} a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or <b>intrusion</b> investigation (a specialist probe into {{the nature and extent of}} an unauthorized network <b>intrusion).</b>|$|E
40|$|Petrographic, chemical, and isotopic {{study of}} {{intrusive}} rocks related to porphyry copper mineralization {{in the northern}} Caribbean area and comparison of these data with similar information on other porphyry copper-related <b>intrusions</b> in island arc and craton regions yield support for the generally accepted, though inadequately tested, generaliza-tion that porphyry copper-related <b>intrusions</b> in island arcs are poorer in K-feldspar than are their craton counterparts. Although most of the mineralized island arc <b>intrusions</b> are quartz diorites, there are more potassic <b>intrusions</b> including quartz monzonites and syenites. All of these <b>intrusions</b> are lower in potassium than their craton counterparts and even the quartz monzonites lack K-feldspar phenocrysts. Island arc <b>intrusions</b> also appear to be depleted in lead and rubidium and to exhibit initial 87 Sr/ 8 øSr ratios of. 705 or less, which are lower than those measured for <b>intrusions</b> in cratonic settings. Copper and possibly zinc are enriched in the island arc <b>intrusions.</b> Chlorine contents are similar to accepted averages for craton <b>intrusions,</b> and fluorine is depleted in the quartz diorites and enriched in granodioritic island arc <b>intrusions.</b> These data indicate that island arc porphyry copper-related <b>intrusions</b> are compositionally more primitive than their craton counterparts and greatly restrict he involvement of epicrustal material {{in the development of}} these magmas...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic <b>intrusions</b> and {{hydrothermal}} activity have modified the diagenetic minerals. In the Ulster Basin, UK, {{most of the}} authigenic mineralization in the Permo-Triassic sandstones pre-dated tertiary volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> The hydrothermal fluids and heat-flow from the volcanic <b>intrusions</b> did not affect quartz and feldspar overgrowths. However, clay mineral-transformation, illite-smectite to illite and chlorite was documented near the volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> Abundant actinolite, illite, chlorite, albite and laumontite cementation of the sand grains were also documented near the volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> The abundance of these cementing minerals decreases away from the volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> In the Hartford Basin, USA, the emplacement of the volcanic <b>intrusions</b> took place simultaneous with sedimentation. The heat-flow from the volcanic <b>intrusions</b> and {{hydrothermal activity}} related to the volcanics modified the texture of authigenic minerals. Microcrystalline mosaic albite and quartz developed rather than overgrowths and crystals near the <b>intrusions.</b> Chlorite clumps and masses were also documented with microcrystalline mosaic albite and quartz. These features are localized near the basaltic <b>intrusions.</b> Laumontite is also documented near the volcanic <b>intrusions.</b> The reservoir characteristics of the studied sandstone formations are highly affected by the volcanic and hydrothermal fluids in the Hartford and the Ulster Basin. The porosity dropped from 27. 4 to zero percent and permeability from 1350 mD to 1 mD...|$|R
50|$|Plume {{magmatism}} {{is supported}} in some <b>intrusions</b> by geochemistry. In particular the Noril'sk-Talnakh <b>intrusions</b> {{are considered to}} be created by plume magmatism and other large <b>intrusions</b> have been suggested as created by mantle plumes. However, the story is not so simple, because most ultramafic-mafic layered <b>intrusions</b> also correlate with craton margins, perhaps because they are exhumed more efficiently in cratonic margins because of faulting and subsequent orogeny.|$|R

40|$|Depressed {{patients}} commonly experience intrusive memories. There is {{some evidence}} that ruminative responses to those <b>intrusions</b> are important for maintaining depressive symptoms. Three models concerning the interplay of <b>intrusions</b> and rumination in the prediction of depressive symptoms were tested in students in 2 studies (N = 711) : (a) rumination moderating between <b>intrusions</b> and depressive symptoms, (b) rumination partially mediating between <b>intrusions</b> and depressive symptoms, and (c) <b>intrusions</b> partially mediating between rumination and depressive symptoms. In our first, cross-sectional study, evidence was found for all models. In our second study, depressive symptoms were also measured prospectively. As for concurrent symptoms, we again found support for the mediation models but not for the moderation model. As for prospective symptoms, we only found evidence for the moderation model. Our findings suggest that rumination and <b>intrusions</b> are mutually reinforcing and that rumination about <b>intrusions</b> indeed contributes to the maintenance of depressive symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The Conuma River and Leagh Creek {{intrusive}} complexes {{are examples}} of mid-crustal portions of the Jurassic Bonanza island arc, located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The Conuma River locality exhibits layered <b>intrusions,</b> consisting of alternating hornblenditic and hornblende gabbroic cumulates, occurring with numerous, contemporaneous small volume mafic to intermediate <b>intrusions</b> in tonalitic rocks. The Leagh Creek <b>intrusions</b> exhibit extensive silicic and basaltic magma mingling. Both complexes are interpreted as products of multiple magma pulses into the solidifying host <b>intrusions.</b> Two new radiometric hornblende Ar-Ar ages suggest Early to Middle Jurassic ages for two <b>intrusions</b> {{from each of the}} complexes. Geochemical crystallization modeling shows a genetic link between the Conuma River cumulate hornblenditic and non-cumulate hornblende gabbroic <b>intrusions</b> via dominantly olivine fractionation. Conversely, most of the <b>intrusions</b> of both complexes cannot be related by simple crystallization modeling, suggesting a complex history, involving magma mingling and assimilation processes...|$|R
40|$|The Mesoproterozoic Mount Angelay igneous complex {{contained}} <b>intrusions</b> {{that were}} emplaced into amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks during two periods of ~ 1550 and post- 1540 Ma magmatism. Sm–Nd isotopic analysis together with mineralogical and chemical considerations {{suggest that the}} <b>intrusions</b> were produced from a Paleoproterozoic crustal source with a T 2 model age ~ 2200 Ma. On geochemical and petrological grounds, the ~ 1550 Ma trondhjemitic <b>intrusions</b> are interpreted to have been produced by melting of amphibolite under garnet-stable conditions (> 8 – 10 kbar). The late-syn to post-peak metamorphic timing of these <b>intrusions</b> suggested that they {{were associated with the}} tectono-thermal event that produced regional peak metamorphic mineral assemblages. The post- 1540 Ma <b>intrusions</b> are K-rich and consist of two groups of synchronously emplaced <b>intrusions,</b> (1) a high-K monzodiorite and monzogranite suite that range between 51 and 77 wt. % SiO 2; and (2) a high-K, Na-enriched hornblende monzonite. The chemistry and mineralogy of these <b>intrusions</b> suggested that they were derived via plagioclase-stable and garnet-unstable melting (30 million year period over which the K-rich post- 1540 Ma <b>intrusions</b> were emplaced suggested that mantle-derived material continued to be injected into the crust. A mantle component to these rocks, and the global distribution of Proterozoic <b>intrusions</b> with similar geochemical affinities, strongly suggests a world-wide period of mantle-induced crustal melting at that time. The dominant Paleoproterozoic isotopic composition of most of these <b>intrusions</b> suggests melting of similarly composed and matured source rocks...|$|R
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, <b>Intrusion</b> Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further <b>intrusion</b> attempts. The program provides notifications for <b>intrusion</b> attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

Brazil also has a large but still unexploited deposit near São Gabriel da Cachoeira, state of Amazonas, as well as a few smaller deposits, notably in the state of Roraima.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{year after}} the initial release, Microsoft quietly {{released}} the second version.

It includes Network Inspection System (NIS), a network <b>intrusion</b> detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs heuristics in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.|$|E
40|$|This body of {{research}} investigated cognitive and biological factors underpinning the development and maintenance of intrusive memories. <b>Intrusions</b> of neutral and aversive images, trauma film stimuli, and negative autobiographical memories were studied in healthy student participants. Study 1 investigated the impact of negative appraisals of <b>intrusions</b> on their subsequent occurrence. <b>Intrusions</b> of a trauma film were greater {{as a result of}} negative appraisal instructions relative to an instruction that <b>intrusions</b> are normal. These findings demonstrated the important rol e that appraisals play in the development of negative, spontaneous memories. Study 2 examined the role of FKBP 5 polymorphisms, which are involved in glucocorticoid regulation, in the development of intrusive memories. High-risk FKBP 5 allele carriers experienced more <b>intrusions</b> of neutral and aversive images, and delayed cortisol recovery after a cold pressor test (CPT), relative to low-risk carriers. This study highlighted the potential for stress-related genetic factors to heighten the risk of developing <b>intrusions.</b> Study 3 investigated the role of stress and sex hormones during the encoding of images on subsequent intrusive memories. Estrogen significantly predicted negative and neutral <b>intrusions</b> in women, while CPT-induced cortisol elevation predicted poorer free recall in men. These findings highlighted the complex influences of sex and stress hormones on emotional memory recall and <b>intrusions.</b> Study 4 investigated the role of stress in the maintenance of <b>intrusions</b> using a reconsolidation paradigm. Reactivation of a trauma film after exposure to a stressor resulted in greater <b>intrusions</b> relative to reactivation or stress alone. The findings from this study suggested a mechanism for the maintenance of <b>intrusions</b> via stress hormone activation during memory reconsolidation. Finally, Study 5 used a reconsolidation paradigm to explore the mechanism by which rumination maintains <b>intrusions.</b> Negative autobiographical memories were reactivated by half of participants and followed by a rumination or filler task. <b>Intrusions</b> did not differ significantly between groups; however, those who engaged in rumination after reactivation later rated the event as more negative, and reported greater avoidance of the memory. Overall, the findings from this thesis shed light on major models of <b>intrusions</b> and suggest potential mechanisms underlying unwanted memories...|$|R

5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the <b>intrusion</b> of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) pose a {{significant}} threat {{to human health}} and safety. During 1990 - 2003, {{the average cost of}} a deer/aircraft collision was $ 38, 000. Various methods of fencing and gating exist to reduce deer <b>intrusions</b> onto airports. We tested one style of electric fence (ElectroBraid) and an electric mat in separate tests on freeranging deer in northern Ohio by measuring deer <b>intrusions</b> and corn consumption at 10 sites. The fence reduced mean daily deer <b>intrusions</b> by 88 - 99 % in each test when the fence was powered. When power was turned on and off within a four-week period, <b>intrusions</b> decreased 57 %. Mean corn consumption differed between treated (< 2 - 6. 4 kg/day) and control sites (15 - 32 kg/day). In the electric-mat test, deer <b>intrusions</b> at treated sites decreased 95 % for the six-week treatment period. Control site <b>intrusions</b> initially decreased by 60 %, but returned to pretreatment levels by week 3. Mean corn consumption was similar between treated (16. 2 kg/day) and control sites (15. 7 kg/day). Results suggest that the electric fence and electric mat, under the conditions of the tests, may significantly reduce deer <b>intrusions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Testosterone {{promotes}} {{aggressive behaviour}} in male vertebrates during the breeding season, but {{the importance of}} testosterone in female aggression remains unclear. Testosterone has both beneficial and detrimental effects on behaviour and physiology, prompting the hypothesis that selection favours an association between aggression and testosterone only in certain contexts in which intense or persistent aggression may be beneficial. We tested this hypothesis in a year-round territorial female buff-breasted wrens (Thryothorus leucotis), by exposing free-living females to experimental <b>intrusions</b> in different social (either single female or male, or paired decoys) and seasonal (pre-breeding or breeding) contexts. Females responded more aggressively to <b>intrusions</b> by females and pairs than to males. However, female <b>intrusions</b> elicited stronger responses during pre-breeding, whereas responses to pair <b>intrusions</b> were more intense during breeding. Territorial females had elevated testosterone levels after female <b>intrusions</b> and intermediate levels after pair <b>intrusions</b> during pre-breeding, but the levels of testosterone remained low after these <b>intrusions</b> during breeding. These results demonstrate seasonal differences in circulating testosterone following territorial aggression in female buff-breasted wrens and are suggestive of differences according to social context as well. Context-dependent elevation of testosterone implies that selection acts directly on female vertebrates to shape patterns of testosterone secretion...|$|R
