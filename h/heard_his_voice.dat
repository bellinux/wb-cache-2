500|$|He {{said that}} his {{performance}} in [...] "I, Borg" [...] was driven by the memories of watching a childhood friend die, and the innocence that he felt given to his friends memory over time; [...] "When I first read the script. I <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> that's what it sounded like – full of wonderment and confusion about everything. That, to me, was Hugh." [...] Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the [...] finale/ opener [...] "", which he felt was similar to his previous ideas.|$|E
500|$|The {{tributes to}} Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, [...] "He {{is gone and}} I am {{supposed}} to cry, but I laugh. Every time I saw the man, every time I <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face." [...] Richie Ashburn, {{a member of the}} 1962 Mets, stated, [...] "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to... He was the happiest man I've ever seen." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times [...] wrote, [...] "God is certainly getting an earful tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|Neither vocal sample used on [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] was contractually cleared with Héctor Delgado or Jayson Musson, {{who were}} both shocked {{to hear the}} song after it became a hit. In February, Delgado was told by his former manager Javier Gómez that he <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> on the song and wanted to take legal action. According to Gómez, Diplo {{subsequently}} called Delgado {{and told him that}} he was unaware [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] sampled his voice when it was released as a single. Gómez called [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] "a clear breaking of intellectual property rights" [...] and said that since Diplo's call, lawyers for Machete Music have been negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation for the sample.|$|E
500|$|A second {{government}} {{force of}} about 200 men operating {{only a few}} thousand yards from the main fight learned of the disaster too late to help. [...] U.S. authorities said the communist radio jammers had knocked out both the main channel and the alternate channel on all local military radios. Versace was captured and taken to a prison deep in the jungle along with two other Americans, Lieutenant Nick Rowe and Sergeant Dan Pitzer. He tried to escape four times, but failed in his attempts.

500|$|Hordern {{viewed the}} 1950s {{as a good}} decade to appear in film, {{although}} he did not then particularly care for the medium. Writing in 1993 he said: [...] "With cinema one has to leap into battle fully armed. From the start of the film the character has to be pinned down like a butterfly on a board. One does not always get this right, of course, sometimes starting at the beginning of shooting a film on a comedic level that cannot be sustained." [...] He disliked his physical appearance, which he found to be [...] "repulsive", and as a result loathed watching back his performances. He preferred radio because the audience only <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> which he then considered his best attribute. Another reason was his recognition of the differences between his sense of personal achievement within a theatre compared to that on a film set: [...] "You get a certain sort of satisfaction in delivering what the director wants of you, but the chances of being emotionally involved are slim." [...] He acknowledged his good ability at learning lines, something which he found to be especially helpful for learning film scripts which frequently changed. [...] He enjoyed the challenge of earning as much value as possible out of a scene and revelled in being able to hit [...] "the right mark for the camera". With the experience of Nina still fresh in his mind, Hordern took a break from the stage and decided to concentrate on his film career.|$|E

2500|$|John Johnston, {{a son of}} James, {{devised a}} test for the witch, {{something}} no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina {{would say to the}} slaves if she thought they did something wrong. The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} meeting with Bukharin, the {{telephone}} rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from The Kremlin said, [...] "Comrade Stalin wishes to speak with you." [...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, {{what are they saying}} in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Susan Hill {{from the}} Daily Star {{reported}} that Lynsey {{would become the}} next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office {{to tell her that}} she would be involved in a [...] "really big storyline", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's [...] "steeliness" [...] helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and his guitar and I thought he was great [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before." ...|$|E
