40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the impact of large inflow of <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> on the Singapore {{manufacturing}} productivity using a panel data at the disaggregated industry level from 1998 to 2008. The results indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> do make productive contribution to manufacturing productivity, but it is much lower as compared to local workers. However, the author observe the declining capital-labour ratio with the increase in the flow of <b>foreign</b> <b>workers.</b> This is expected to have direct impact on the competitiveness of the manufacturing in the export market. Since new technologies are embodied in new capital investment, the declining capital-labour ratio indicates that workers might be producing output with less technology-intensive capital. Conversely, local workers are more productive with high capital investment, indicating that local workers are more skilled and hence there is more complementarity between capital investments and local human capital. Design/methodology/approach - The author implement a panel estimation of disaggregated industry level data of Singapore manufacturing from 1998 to 2008. The author use GMM estimation to control for any endogeneity issues in the estimation. Findings - The results indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> do make productive contribution to manufacturing productivity; but it is much lower as compared to local workers. However; the author observe the declining capital-labour ratio with the increase in the flow of <b>foreign</b> <b>workers.</b> Research limitations/implications - The data for <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> at the disaggregated level is not publically available and this is given for this research purpose. The data for <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> is limited as it does not have by educational levels. Practical implications - This is the first paper to study impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> on manufacturing sector at a disaggregated panel data.
