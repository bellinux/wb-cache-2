5|$|England won the toss and {{declined}} from 125/0 to 245 all out, {{the last five}} wickets tumbling for just 22 runs. Malcolm Marshall and Curtly Ambrose took all ten wickets between them. The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England {{had a chance to}} <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.|$|E

5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they pushed forward {{in an attempt to}} extend their lead. Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|As the Dalek discovers Rose, {{the video}} feeds to the Vault are lost, and the Doctor {{immediately}} sets off {{to try to}} <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Vault. The Dalek tries to kill Rose but it cannot, having found compassion from Rose's DNA. The Dalek is urged to kill van Statton, but Rose instead convinces to spare his life. She follows the Dalek as it makes {{its way to the}} highest part of the Vault and destroys the roof, exposing the area to natural sunlight that the Dalek basks in. The Doctor arrives and prepares to kill the Dalek, but Rose stops him, convincing him the Dalek has developed emotions. However, the Dalek is unable to cope with them, and it asks Rose to orders its own self-destruction to end its pain. Rose reluctantly agrees, and the Dalek shortly implodes thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As the peloton {{approached}} the Côte de la Redoute, {{there was a}} large crash. Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E

5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven new players to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout left only nine james to meld the new players into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and last place in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for last place at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> running for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
