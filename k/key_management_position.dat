40|$|Abstract The {{university}} {{as an organization}} is changing, incorporating elements of private sector management in an academic setting. In these transforming universi-ties middle management has changed as well. In this contribution changes in the role and position of the academic deanship are analysed in more detail. On {{the basis of a}} literature review, a description of the deanship is provided, including the main challenges this position entails. It is argued that the deanship has become more demanding, more senior, more strategic, more complex and more managerial in nature, though within the overall context of academe. We illustrate both the complex-ity and changing nature of the deanship by drawing on two empirical studies. Since research on middle management in universities is still rather thin, more research is welcome. Therefore we conclude with some suggestions for further research to enhance our understanding of what we see as a <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>position</b> within today’s universities.

40|$|Previous family {{business}} literature has analyzed how various management strategies or family tension has impacted profit. However, profit can vary {{due to the}} different family values and goals placed on the firm. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how the business philosophy of a {{family business}} influenced profit. The present study sought to examine how the family business 2 ̆ 7 philosophy, as in if they have a family-first or business-first orientation, influences profit. This study also investigates how the distribution of the business to the next generation, as well as how hiring family members who may not have the qualifications to key management positions, could decrease family business profit. Results showed that a family-first philosophy did not have a statistically significant effect on profit, while distributing the business to a family successor positively affected profit. The attitude that family members should be hired to a <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>position</b> regardless of their qualification did not significantly affect business profit.

40|$|In essay two, I study top {{executive}} compensation and CEO turnover {{and their relationship}} to firm performance in business groups in China, using a sample of listed subsidiaries and their parent companies in China. The empirical results support the hypothesis that the pay-performance sensitivity of managerial compensation (CEO turnover) in a listed firm is positively (negatively) related to the accounting performance of its parent company. In addition, I find a stronger relationship between the compensation (turnover) in a listed subsidiary and the performance of its parent company when the controlling shareholder's ownership is high. Using related party transactions to proxy for the correlation between the two firms, I find that management compensation in a listed firm is related to the performance of its parent company if related party transactions exist between them. Using brand name as a proxy for reputation, I find that management compensation and CEO turnover in group firms {{are more likely to be}} sensitive to the performance measures in their parent companies if both use the same brand name. In conclusion, the association between the listed subsidiary and its parent company may affect the pay-for-performance sensitivity to a parent company. Keywords: Communist Party of China (CPC), party secretary, performance; management compensation, business group, ChinaMy dissertation includes two essays. In essay one, I investigate the party control in China's listed firms. Along with state shareholding and government administration, the third source of political control of Chinese listed firms is the Communist Party of China (CPC). Using a unique hand-collected dataset that includes the party secretaries' information for listed firms between 2000 and 2004, I examine the existence and power of the party secretaries in companies and their influence on performance. The party secretary is the leader of party committee and exercises the power of the CPC at firm-level. Power is assessed by whether the party secretary concurrently holds another <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>position,</b> such as chairman or CEO, thus allowing him or her to exert influence on the managerial decisions of the firm. I find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and firms with many employees are more likely to have a party secretary or a powerful party secretary than are other firms. Party secretaries are more likely to have political reliability but less professionalism than are CEOs or other senior managers. The existence of a party secretary is negatively associated with a firm's performance, but only in SOEs. Non-state firms with a party secretary are more likely to have senior managers with political connections, but less professionalism, but I find no such significant results for SOEs. The firms with a party secretary or a powerful party secretary have lower labor productivity than do other firms, especially in SOEs and in regions with high unemployment rates. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the CPC has great influence over listed firms in China and that this influence should not be neglected in Chinese studies. Yu, Wei. Adviser: P. H.

30|$|Additionally, HE {{students}} in this study expressed concern regarding promotion opportunities in the Vietnamese hospitality industry. They perceived their future chances of being promoted to the managerial level as limited, and reported that they felt mechanisms for promotion lacked consistency in the industry. This appeared likely to impact on their long-term commitment to hospitality as a career. Evidence in this study confirms the phenomenon of limited diffusion of knowledge and skills at the managerial level in multinational hotel enterprises in developing countries (Andriotis 2002; Fortanier and Van Wijik 2010; Kusluvan and Karamustafa 2001). <b>Key</b> <b>management</b> <b>positions</b> are generally outsourced to maintain firm specific advantages (Andriotis 2002; Dunning 1988), and only basic operational level skill personnel are trained locally to assure service quality and performance (Ascher 1985; Dunning 1988; Kusluvan and Karamustafa 2001). Such outsourcing strategies for <b>management</b> <b>positions</b> were found to jeopardise employment opportunities in the local community (Fortanier and Van Wijik 2010; Kusluvan and Karamustafa 2001; Mowforth and Munt 2003). This also limits both potential upskilling for local HE trainees and graduates as they potentially transition from their academic learning environments into industry practice. The situation in the Vietnamese context also aligns with research elsewhere reporting the inability of many HE graduates to apply their knowledge and skills in their workplaces (Elias and Purcell 2004; Keep and Mayhew 2004). This has important implications for a clear differentiation between VET and HE in terms of academic and professional preparation for students at relevant levels, and confirms the importance of a differentiated career path for VET and HE graduates recognised by the hospitality industry.|$|R

The study included analysis of communication strategies used by women as compared to their male colleagues. We note that {{research in this area}} has previously been done, but there has been a fairly limited focus examining only female communication strategies. Our study shows that the women use a variety of communication strategies, rather than a single strategy, and the main conclusion we can draw is that the women are proficient in changing communication strategies and methods depending on their audience. The study also shows an unexpected fact that goes against the published research on female communication in typically male dominated roles: Women in male-dominated professions choose to take on the communication style of men, using straight, simple and factual communication, rather than detailed, less direct communication styles generally associated with women...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the effect of women directors on the performance of family firms with a case study of India. Existing literature on the subject has primarily focused on widely held firms, notably in the US. Given that ownership structure and governance environment of family firms are distinctly different from those of non-family firms, the {{evidence on the}} relationship between women on board and firm performance in the context of widely held firms may not apply in the context of family firms. India provides an ideal setting for analyzing this question as the presence of family firms is pervasive and since 2013 India has instituted gender quotas on corporate boards. Using a data-set of 10218 firm year observations over a ten year period from 2005 to 2014 which spans the pre-quota and post-quota years, we find robust evidence that women directors on corporate boards positively impact firm value and that this effect increases with the number of women directors on board.

This theme is developed to extend the concept of management expertise in museums and galleries to enable due consideration {{to be given to}} applications of management theory which are seen to be under-utilized yet appropriate to the changing environment in which museums and galleries currently operate. Thought is given to the attitudes and antecedents of the museum profession and their seeming reluctance to develop new management skills. The complexities of subject-specialists occupying <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>positions</b> within museums and galleries is discussed and the move to a more consultative approach to management is recommended. Part Two explores Organization Theory, its historical and contemporary view and its relevance to the museum and gallery context. An analysis of organizational structure questions the understanding by museum managers of the importance of appropriate structures to the successful and effective control of' museums and galleries. Following on from this is a detailed look at structural patterns and how best to understand and design appropriate structures within the environment of change currently affecting museums. To give guidance to this line of thought Organization Culture, Conflict and Change is examined to point out the importance of a cognizant approach to these subjects by senior museum professionals in order to provide the most appropriate structure within institutions which are required to function with historic collections in a competitive environment that has seen fundamental changes, generally, over the past twenty 11 years. 1...|$|R

The relevance of the topic is grasped in {{the context in which}} project management has been confronted with various shifts: from a technical / engineering function to a macro-economic organizational concern, from a tools-and-techniques view to an innovation-driven approach, from widespread adoption by the industrialized world to an accelerated growth in developing nations, too.
