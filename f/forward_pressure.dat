5|$|The English {{played the}} first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum {{dominated}} the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English <b>forward</b> <b>pressure.</b> The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in {{the first half}} of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the half way line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.|$|E

In order to properly counteract the additional <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> from the wing-backs in the system, other sides, including Ronald Koeman's Everton and Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham, also utilised the formation against Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies for a team is their forecheck. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking {{is an important part of}} the dump and chase strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one <b>forward</b> <b>pressures</b> the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one <b>forward</b> will apply <b>pressure</b> to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the left wing lock, which has two <b>forwards</b> <b>pressure</b> the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.|$|R
50|$|Elbows {{can also}} be used, at a more {{advanced}} stage, to control and restrict the opponent's range of movement by exerting <b>forward</b> elbow <b>pressure</b> on his elbows and forearms. This allows Wing Chun practitioners to trap more effectively at a very close range.|$|R

25|$|The second semi-final saw France face England. The boot of Jonny Wilkinson was the {{difference}} between the two sides, with England coming out victors in torrential rain: although France scored the game's only try after an early English line-out error, they never seriously threatened the English line otherwise. And with handling being difficult in the wet and windy conditions, England's superior <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> and territorial control forced France to concede a slew of penalties, of which Wilkinson kicked five, also adding three drop goals (two off his less-favoured right boot) - a remarkable display considering that the swirling winds made accurate kicking as difficult as the rain and mud made passing and running.|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily represent those of the Bank of Thailand. The paper addresses challenges facing monetary operations under an inflation targeting framework in light of large foreign exchange flows. Large foreign exchange flows, besides contributing to weaker interest rate pass-through, lead to an increasing obligation to sterilize. Moreover, changing composition of foreign exchange flows has posed further complications with regard to appropriate allocation of operational instruments. A quantitative assessment based on a simple but intuitive model suggests that flexibility is the key to achieve the optimal allocation of instruments, given the dynamism of global environment. Going <b>forward,</b> <b>pressures</b> from foreign exchange flows should remain, bringing about policy implications in terms of exchange rate policy cooperation and capital account liberalization...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{looks at}} {{financial}} market innovation {{and how it}} has led to the rapid growth of structured products. It explores the mechanisms that come into play as assets inside these products (mortgages, credit card receivables, etc.) suffer losses. The potential size of such losses is currently concerning financial markets, and the paper looks at various ways to quantify the issues and where, going <b>forward,</b> <b>pressures</b> are most likely to arise. The problem is seen mainly as a stock adjustment issue (related to inventories of assets etc.) that is going to require time to set right. Time could well be more important than the cost of capital. The idea of a super fund to buy up unwanted assets should be seen in this context. The paper goes on to look at financial market implications, including the credit supply process, spreads, and the dollar. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Camel soon {{gained an}} unfortunate {{reputation}} with pilots. Some inexperienced pilots crashed on take-off when the {{full fuel load}} pushed the aircraft's centre of gravity beyond the rearmost safe limits. When in level flight, the Camel was markedly tail-heavy. Unlike the Sopwith Triplane, the Camel lacked a variable incidence tailplane, so that the pilot had to apply constant <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the control stick to maintain a level attitude at low altitude. The aircraft could be rigged so that at higher altitudes it could be flown [...] "hands off". A stall immediately resulted in a dangerous spin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. [...] The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot {{does not have to}} maintain constant backward or <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). [...] Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. [...] Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{dimension}} {{is given to the}} concept of membrane fouling. In the already known fouling mechanisms for dead-end operated ultrafiltration membranes fouling is considered a radial phenomenon. However, fouling also appears to have longitudinal effects. Experiments were performed with a lab-scale test installation under constant flux conditions with demiwater that contained ferric hydroxide flocs as fouling components. The experiments showed that during operation capillaries became blocked by fouling plugs resulting in capillaries that were filled completely with solids. The presence of blockages, especially at the concentrate side of the capillaries, could not be detected by measuring the clean water resistance. However such blockages did result in an increased <b>forward</b> flush <b>pressure.</b> A combination of the clean water resistance and the <b>forward</b> flush <b>pressure</b> is suitable for determining the fouling of a membrane and the effectiveness of a cleaning procedure.

60|$|This {{time while}} I watched {{assemblies}} seated, men in hotels and passers-by, I fancied {{that he kept}} this habit of semi-tenseness at home among his own; {{that it was the}} complement of the man's still countenance, and his even, lowered voice. Looking at their footmarks on the ground they seem to throw an almost straight track, neither splayed nor in-toed, and to set their feet down with a gentle <b>forward</b> <b>pressure,</b> rather like the Australian's stealthy footfall. Talking among themselves, or waiting for friends, they did not drum with their fingers, fiddle with their feet, or feel the hair on their faces. These things seem trivial enough, but when breeds are in the making everything is worth while. A man told me once--but I never tried the experiment--that each of our Four Races light and handle fire in their own way.|$|E
50|$|A stop-{{check valve}} is {{a check valve}} with {{override}} control to stop flow regardless of flow direction or pressure. In addition to closing in response to backflow or insufficient <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> (normal check-valve behavior), {{it can also be}} deliberately shut by an external mechanism, thereby preventing any flow regardless of <b>forward</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{has changed}} {{significantly}} and modern forwards {{are expected to}} chase down and tackle defenders and in fact steal goals. Leigh Matthews triple premiership winning Brisbane Lions with players like Jason Akermanis excelled at applying <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> on opposition teams. Now shorter faster forwards, such as Aaron Davey are becoming increasingly popular for applying <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> and are credited with revolutionising the attacking game.|$|E
5000|$|The valves are {{structures}} {{that have a}} higher pressure drop for the flow in one direction (reverse) than the other (forward). This difference in flow resistance causes a net directional flow rate in the forward direction in oscillating flows.

40|$|It is {{standard}} practice to provide anechoic termination {{in order to}} obtain consistent gas pulsation measurement data for the positive displacement machinery in the compressor industry [1]. The same holds for the measurement of acoustic power generated by fans or compressors. The underlying idea is to eliminate reflected wave. This prompted several researchers {{to make use of the}} so-called two-microphone method or the transfer function method to decompose the standing wave into the two constituent progressive waves [2] in order to meet the exigencies of the industrial applications where an anechoic termination may not be available. This is particularly true of the refrigeration compressor industry where it is di$cult to control the terminal impedance in the suction or discharge lines of the regular testing facility in the factory environment [3]. However, it is generally not known or appreciated that the <b>forward</b> wave <b>pressure</b> or the associated power in a reflective environment is not equal to that in an anechoic environment. Therefore, extraction of the <b>forward</b> wave <b>pressure</b> from the standing wave pressure field by means of the two-microphone method is inherently falacious. This has been demonstrated by Lai through several tests on a simplified model [3]. The same is sought to be established here in a general way...|$|R

50|$|Wheel-barrowing is {{a problem}} that may occur when a pilot places {{excessive}} <b>forward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the flight controls of an aeroplane with a tricycle gear configuration during takeoff or landing. <b>Forward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the elevator control results in an upward force on the elevator surfaces in the aircraft's tail, thereby transferring weight from the main wheels of the landing gear to the nose wheel.
