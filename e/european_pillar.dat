50|$|The {{territory}} {{now known}} as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean mythological beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of Baal and Melqart; the latter lasted into Roman times as Hercules, mythical founder of both Cádiz and Seville. The Islote de Sancti Petri held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his Twelve labors; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster Geryon. Traditionally, the Pillars of Hercules flank the Strait of Gibraltar. Clearly, the <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> is the Rock of Gibraltar; the African pillar was presumably either Monte Hacho in Ceuta or Jebel Musa in Morocco. The Roman road that led from Cádiz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being Via Herculea, Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present coat of arms of Andalusia shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.|$|E

50|$|The <b>European</b> Communities <b>pillar</b> handled economic, {{social and}} {{environmental}} policies. It comprised the European Community (EC), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, until its expiry in 2002), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam also {{transferred}} {{the areas of}} asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters from the JHA to the <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar,</b> the remainder being renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the EU's European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) since 1998 has strongly affected the EU-NATO relationship. Starting with the Franco-British bilateral declaration at Saint-Malo in December 1998, the EU recognized the need for autonomous military capacities for actions outside NATO's framework. This policy challenged NATO's agreement to enhance the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) as a <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> within NATO, as agreed at NATO's Ministerial Meeting in Berlin in June 1996. As the {{development of}} the EU's ESDP between December 1998 and December 2000 indicated, the members of the EU have put more emphasis on developing ESDP within the EU rather than developing ESDI within NATO. Developing the ESDP inside the EU, however, tends to undermine NATO's concept of strengthening the <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> under the authority of the North Atlantic Council...|$|E

50|$|Upon its {{entry into}} force in 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon renamed the Commission of the European Communities the European Commission, {{reflecting}} the de facto name {{as well as the}} fact that the <b>European</b> Communities <b>pillar</b> was abolished {{along with the rest of}} the pillar system.|$|R
50|$|Concerns were voiced that an {{independent}} <b>European</b> security <b>pillar</b> {{might result in}} a declining importance of NATO as a transatlantic forum. In response to St. Malo, the former US-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put forth the three famous D’s, which outline American expectations towards ESDP to this day: no duplication of what was done effectively under NATO, no decoupling from the US and NATO, and no discrimination against non-EU members such as Turkey.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the first}} pillar {{followed}} {{the principles of}} supranationalism. The pillar structure of the EU allowed the areas of European co-operation to be increased without leaders handing {{a large amount of}} power to supranational institutions. The pillar system segregated the EU. What were formerly the competencies of the EEC fell within the <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar.</b> Justice and Home Affairs was introduced as a new <b>pillar</b> while <b>European</b> Political Cooperation became the second pillar (the Common Foreign and Security Policy).|$|R

30|$|Paid {{sick leave}} and {{sickness}} benefits are central {{parts of the}} social security systems of the European welfare states. The first preliminary outline of a <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> of social rights states that, “All workers, regardless of contract type, shall be ensured adequately paid sick leave during periods of illness” (European Commission 2016 a, 13). Sick pay and sickness benefits are important as protection of an employee’s income during periods of illness or injury. Without this financial insurance, employees that cannot afford the loss of income might be forced to work while sick. This can further deteriorate the employee’s health and might also have other unfortunate consequences, such as the spreading of disease and lower firm productivity (Scheil-Adlung and Sandner 2010; Hemp 2004; Hansen and Andersen 2008).|$|E
50|$|To save on resources, these {{separate}} executives {{created by}} the Rome Treaties were merged in 1965 by the Merger Treaty. The institutions of the EEC would take over responsibilities for {{the running of the}} EEC and Euratom, with all three then becoming known as the European Communities even if each legally existed separately. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty created the European Union, which absorbed the Communities into the <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar,</b> yet Euratom still maintained a distinct legal personality.|$|R
50|$|The Court did {{not have}} a defined legal status until the Treaty of Maastricht when it was made the fifth {{institution}}, the first new institution since the founding of the Community. By becoming an institution it gained some new powers, such as the ability to bring actions before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At first its audit power related only to the <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar</b> of the <b>European</b> Union (EU), but under the Treaty of Amsterdam it gained the full power to audit the finances of the whole of the EU.|$|R

30|$|In the 2016 State of the Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, {{called for}} {{increased}} efforts towards {{construction of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Social Rights, stressing that Europe was not social enough and it needed a change in that respect (European Commission 2016). Building upon this topic, in January 2017, President Juncker conceptualized his earlier statement specifically {{within the framework of}} the minimum wage policy, stressing that while all member states are free to set the minimum wage in line with the local conditions, “There is a level of dignity we have to respect” (Guarascio 2017). Such calls have been reflected also in the demands of the European citizens (Maselli 2016). In this paper, we would like to contribute to the debate started by President Juncker by attributing a monetary value to the notion of the “minimum level of dignity” for the individual EU countries and asses the scope for adjustments needed to achieve this aim.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} period the {{political}} and security infrastructure in Europe has changed dramatically, in particular {{after the collapse of}} communism in Central and Eastern Europe. This has resulted in a process of transformation not only within the former socialist countries, but also in the various political and security institutions.

The changing functions of WEU, which became clear especially after its `reactivation' in 1984 and the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty (1992), are reflected in this volume.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{framework}} for measuring {{the threat of the}} emergent European Security and Defense Program (ESDP) to the transatlantic link. There is a range of possible outcomes, outcomes that have varying implications for the U. S. as a global and European power. ESDP will emerge as either a strategic competitor to NATO that negates or significantly diminishes U. S. influence in Europe, or alternatively, ESDP might emerge as a strategic partner to NATO that restores the strategic balance in the Euro-Atlantic partnership with a reinvigorated <b>European</b> <b>pillar.</b> With the concept just {{a little over a year}} old, it is still too early to tell exactly how ESDP will mature and what form it will take. As it develops, though, it is useful to have some measures to help evaluate the direction being taken, either continuing toward partnership or diverging toward competition. Three criteria-indivisibility, improvement, and inclusiveness-are useful benchmarks for tracking the future course of Euro-Atlantic relations...|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the entry}} into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union {{comprised}} a system of three legal pillars, of which only the <b>European</b> Communities <b>pillar</b> had its own legal personality. The Treaty of Lisbon abolished this pillar system, and as a consolidated entity, the European Union succeeded the legal personality of the European Communities. Therefore, the EU is now able to sign international treaties in its own name. The European Union gained for example membership of the World Trade Organization immediately after the {{entry into force}} of the Treaty of Lisbon, since the European Communities was already {{a member of that}} organisation.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} two of the leading theories in international relations – neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism – by assessing their usefulness when applied to the case of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). At the end of the Cold War these two theoretical traditions came to opposite conclusions about the viability of the Atlantic Alliance in a world without the Soviet Union: Neorealism expected NATO’s demise, while neoliberal institutionalism expected it to remain the basis for transatlantic cooperation. While it is clear that the break-up scenario predicted by many realists in the early 1990 s has not materialized, it seems apparent that the structural forces of the international system are slowly pulling the North American and <b>European</b> <b>pillars</b> of NATO apart. The most recent manifestation of this is the conflict in Afghanistan, where NATO members have been unable to agree upon a coherent strategy and where Alliance solidarity has become severely strained. Although the final result of that conflict has yet to be determined, it has uncovered cracks in the Atlantic Alliance that are unlikely to be easily mended. The thesis concludes that the usefulness of each theory depends on what question one wants to answer, but that their usefulness overall is limited. Systems theories are so broad that they can explain almost any turn of events, and although they can help us understand direction of the international system, the condition for their falsification is difficult if not impossible to specify. The international structure is vital to understanding the context within which states act, but systems theories are in themselves insufficient to explain particular events...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the evolution and prospects of post- 1945 British policies regarding multinational European security institutions, particularly the European Union (EU), the Western European Union (WEU), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Specifically, this thesis analyses the factors behind the Blair government's 1998 proposal to strengthen the <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> of NATO and endow the EU with a defense dimension. This policy offers certain advantages for Britain's foreign and domestic policy agendas. Most of the other member nations of the European Union have responded favorably to the British policy shift since it has given a new impetus to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). This thesis examines the Blair government's initiatives in European defense, and assesses the ramifications of the December 1998 St. Malo declaration by Britain and France. In addition, it addresses how building the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) may strengthen both NATO and the European Union and assist in making the EU's CFSP a reality. U. S. Navy (U.

40|$|Cohesion {{policy is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} EU’s key instruments to strive for inclusive growth. At the same time, the impact of the economic crisis and years of austerity have put the social dimension of EU policy back on the agenda. The 2015 Five Presidents’ Report called for a ‘social triple A for Europe’, while the Commission recently presented the <b>European</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Social Rights, aiming to “serve as a compass for the renewed convergence within the euro area”. With the discussions on the EU budget and cohesion policy on the way, it is now high time to consider whether EU cohesion policy has the right tools to be a driver for social progress and deliver on the EU’s social objectives. In this Policy Brief, Claire Dhéret highlights the limitations of cohesion policy’s current functioning in addressing the new geographical divides emerging across the EU and argues that more prominence needs to be put on qualitative and human capital investment in the future. To that end, cohesion policy post 2020 will require some fundamental policy-readjustments, which also need to be embedded in a strong governance framework...|$|E
50|$|The EEC {{became the}} <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar</b> of the EU, with the ECSC and EAEC {{continuing}} {{in a similar}} subordinate position, existing separately in a legal sense but governed by {{the institutions of the}} EU as if they were its own. The ECSC's treaty had a 50-year limit and thus expired in 2002, all its activities are now absorbed into the European Community. The EAEC had no such limit and thus continues to exist. Due to the sensitive nature of nuclear power with the European electorate, the treaty has gone without amendment since its signing and was not even to be changed with the European Constitution intended to repeal all other treaties (the Constitution's replacement, the Treaty of Lisbon, likewise makes no attempt at amendment).|$|R
5000|$|All three pillars {{were the}} {{extensions}} of existing policy structures. The <b>European</b> Community <b>pillar</b> was {{the continuation of}} the European Economic Community with the [...] "Economic" [...] being dropped from the name to represent the wider policy base given by the Maastricht Treaty. Coordination in foreign policy had taken place {{since the beginning of the}} 1970s under the name of European Political Cooperation (EPC), which had been first written into the treaties by the Single European Act but not as a part of the EEC. While the Justice and Home Affairs pillar extended cooperation in law enforcement, criminal justice, asylum, and immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters, some of these areas had already been subject to intergovernmental cooperation under the Schengen Implementation Convention of 1990.|$|R

This idea was included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. With a legal personality, Union is, for instance, able to be part of international treaties. The Treaty of Lisbon also states that [...] "the Union shall replace and succeed the European Community," [...] with the effect that, once the Treaty entered into force, the EU obtained the membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which had belonged to the <b>European</b> Communities <b>pillar.</b>|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{the process of}} the European implementation of a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) at Maastricht in December 1991 until the Franco-British declaration on European defense at Saint-MlÌ o in December 1998, the EU's European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) etched out the initial concept of a <b>European</b> <b>Pillar</b> within the framework of NATO expressed in NATO's European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI). The Franco-British declaration at Saint- MlÌ o demonstrated the willingness of some EU member states to promote autonomous military capabilities within the EU that enables the EU to act outside of NATO's framework. The further development of ESDP led to concern among NATO officials and US diplomats regarding ESDP's potential challenging appearance to NATO. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed this concern about a growing EU opposition to the transatlantic policy of alliance. In January 2003, during the Iraq Crisis, Mr. Rumsfeld labeled France and Germany as the "Old Europe". The relation of ESDP to NATO is strongly affected by the national interests of leading European actors like France and Germany. The development of ESDP as either a competitor or support arm of NATO depends on whether the French or the German approach to European security becomes dominant. Major, German Air Forc...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the JRC-led research on ‘ICT-enabled Social Innovation to support the implementation of the Social Investment Package’ (IESI) conducted in partnership with the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. The IESI research is set out to help policymakers and practitioners use ICT-enabled social innovation to modernise welfare systems, provide better and more efficient social services, and ultimately increase the wellbeing and quality of life of citizens. The original research design, its theoretical framework and empirical findings contribute to the growing scientific interest on ICT-enabled social innovation in the field of social policy reforms, within the scope of the implementation of the social investment approach. Based on the analysis of evidence gathered through a documented collection of initiatives across the EU, the research also advances a proposal for developing a methodological framework to assess the social and economic impact of ICT enabled social innovation. The approach proposed is expected to support policymakers and relevant stakeholders in designing, monitoring and evaluating ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives, which could be transferred, scaled-up and replicated across Europe. Insights from the research contribute to the policy debate on the implementation of the <b>European</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Social Rights {{and the future of the}} Welfare State in the EU. JRC.

40|$|The Master's Thesis "The Special Relationship, the ESDP and the British National Interest at the Turn of the New Millenium" {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} of the United Kingdom to both the United States and the European Union during the premiership of Tony Blair. By using critical discourse analysis and applying three criteria {{within the framework of the}} procedural concept of national interest, the work seeks to determine whether the creation and further development of the European Security and Defence Policy was in the British national interest and whether it was compatible with the close UK-US relationship. After having examined the British public political discourse of three main political parties on security and defence, this thesis arrives at the conclusion that for Britain it was essential to keep NATO at the centre of its security, to maintain the close relationship with the US and to improve Britain's position in Europe. The core attitudes of the British political elite remained unchanged in the respected period. On the discourse level, the ESDP was in the British national interest as it was presented as an effort to strengthen the <b>European</b> <b>pillar</b> within NATO.

2500|$|After {{becoming}} {{de facto}} independent from the empire of Philip II of Spain around 1585 the country experienced {{almost a century}} of explosive economic growth. A technological revolution in shipbuilding led to a competitive advantage in shipping that helped the young Republic become the dominant trade power by the mid-17th century. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping—about half the <b>European</b> total. <b>Pillars</b> of this position were {{the dominance of the}} Amsterdam Entrepôt in European trade, and that of the Dutch East and West India Companies (VOC and WIC) in intercontinental trade.
