Within Fowler, the route serves the hamlet of Balmat (located on {{the eastern edge of}} Sylvia Lake) before intersecting NY58 in the hamlet of Fowler. Here, NY812 joins NY58 northeast along the southern bank of the now-unified Oswegatchie River to the village of Gouverneur, located in the town of the same name, where NY812 leaves NY58 but <b>joins</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route11 (US11) {{at the heart of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Delaware Route 9 Truck (DE 9 Truck) is a truck bypass of {{a stretch}} of DE 9 south of New Castle. It heads {{northwest}} from DE 9 on two-lane undivided Hamburg Road, passing through farmland with some development. In Tybouts Corner, the truck route turns northeast to join US 13 on the four-lane divided South Dupont Highway. The road passes through farmland with some residential and commercial development. Farther north, the road heads into business areas, passing under Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line before intersecting US 40 in State Road. At this point, US 40 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 13 and DE 9 Truck, with the road widening to eight lanes. In Hares Corner, DE 9 Truck turns east to follow DE 273 on two-lane undivided Frenchtown Road, heading east between business parks {{to the south and}} farm fields to the north. DE 9 Truck ends along with DE 273 at an intersection with DE 9 and the southern terminus of DE 141 west of New Castle.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after CR 557 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 40, {{the road}} enters Buena, Atlantic County and {{continues}} southeast into inhabited areas. After {{running through the}} commercial center of town, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and {{the eastern end of}} CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts {{for the remainder of the}} route.|$|E

5|$|At this point, DE 404 {{continues}} northeast concurrent with US 9 on East Market Street {{through the}} downtown area. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision railroad line {{and runs through}} residential areas with a few businesses. US 9/DE 404 heads east-northeast out of Georgetown and becomes Lewes Georgetown Highway, passing through farmland and woodland with some development. The two routes intersect the eastern terminus of US 9 Truck/DE 404 Truck a short distance east of Georgetown. In Gravel Hill, the road intersects DE 30. Following this intersection, US 9/DE 404 passes through more rural land, reaching a junction with DE 5 in Harbeson. Past here, the two routes cross a Delaware Coast Line Railroad line. Farther east, residential development near the road begins to increase. Upon reaching {{the area of the}} Five Points intersection in Nassau, US 9/DE 404 runs past homes and businesses, widening into a divided highway and coming to an intersection with DE 1D/DE 23. DE 23 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 9/DE 404 for a concurrency on a four-lane divided highway before the road comes to a junction with DE 1. Here, DE 23/DE 404 ends, US 9 Bus. continues northeast, and US 9 heads east for a concurrency with DE 1. At this intersection, access from eastbound DE 404 to northbound DE 1 is provided by a reverse jughandle.|$|E

25|$|The Somerville Circle <b>joins</b> <b>U.S.</b> Routes 202 and 206, and New Jersey Route 28. A {{bridge over}} the circle allows Route 202 to bypass the {{intersecting}} roads. Ever since the bridge {{was built in the}} 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation no longer considers the Somerville Circle a traffic circle, but the intersection still contains a 360 degree loop, interrupted on one side with traffic lights. According to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, the circle averages 11,786 vehicles a day.|$|E

25|$|Here, CR33 intersects and <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 202 for a {{third of}} a mile before turning north. It crosses CR 94 in {{downtown}} Garnerville. In fact, this used to be the former eastern terminus of CR94, until it was extended beyond US 9W/US 202 in West Haverstraw. CR33 then proceeds into the town of Stony Point for the final mile and a half of its run. It intersects CR 98 and CR 100 before coming to an end at CR 106. It really would be impossible to extend CR33 further north as Bear Mountain State Park lies close to its northern terminus.|$|E
