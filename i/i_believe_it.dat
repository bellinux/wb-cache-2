5|$|To me Reform Judaism is {{an irresistible}} conviction. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{to be the}} {{religion}} of the Jewish future, while I regard orthodoxy as a survival that may have a galvanized life now and then, but on the whole is doomed.|$|E
5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
5|$|I {{believe in}} all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever to the campaign... {{but it is not a}} smear if you point out the record of your opponent.|$|E

25|$|I {{believe all}} {{the works of}} the bridge are completed, and that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be {{perfectly}} secure and safe. The Company have as yet only laid one line of rails over this structure, and I beg to recommend that permission be given to open that one line.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{nothing of}} that part; but <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> as <b>it</b> was, that {{whatever}} was done, Amy had done it; and that, in short, Amy {{had made her}} away; and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> the more, because Amy came no more near me, but confirmed her guilt by her absence.|$|R
25|$|The whole {{continent}} of North America {{appears to be}} destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one nation, speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is indispensable {{that they should be}} associated in one federal Union.|$|E
25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E
25|$|Ladies and Gentlemen I {{accept the}} flowers as a memento of {{reconciliation}} {{between the white}} and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as {{it comes from a}} colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is myself. (Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E

25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|On November 2, 2005, {{the team}} was honoured, en masse, {{as members of the}} Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. In the {{induction}} ceremony, Phil Esposito spoke: [...] "A lot of people will go back and say 1972 changed the face of the game and actually <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> did. I'm not so sure it changed for the better, by the way. But it did change the way we think and look at hockey in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Following this {{introduction}} to his style and philosophy, Colbert listed {{a series of}} absurd [...] "beliefs that I live by", such as [...] "I believe in America. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> exists." [...] He alluded to outsourcing to China and satirized the traditional Republican opposition to [...] "big government" [...] by referencing the Iraq War. [...] "I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we {{have set up a}} fabulous government in Iraq." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My God, MacIan!" [...] {{he called}} out, showing his first emotion of that night. [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> the pace; it couldn't be the pace. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> us." ...|$|R
500|$|British Foreign Secretary William Hague {{announced}} Norgrove's death. In {{a written}} statement, {{he said that}} after receiving information on her location it was [...] "decided that, given the danger she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on that information." [...] Prime Minister Cameron defended the rescue attempt: [...] "Decisions on operations to free hostages are always difficult. But where a British life is in such danger, and where we and our allies can act, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is right to try".|$|E
500|$|Darwin also {{observed}} a luminous [...] "jelly-fish {{of the genus}} Dianaea" [...] and noted that [...] "When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is generally owing to minute crustacea. But {{there can be no}} doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent." [...] He guessed that [...] "a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere" [...] was probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin [...] "was lucky with most of his guesses, but not here", noting that biochemistry was too little known, and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved [...] "would have been too much for comfort".|$|E
500|$|Debs {{was noted}} {{by many to}} be a charismatic speaker who {{sometimes}} called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion. It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations. As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: [...] "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "How were {{we going}} to end this, without giving {{anything}} away, without making it too obvious, because the minute the audience's mind begins to work, you're on very dangerous ground. Because if you tell them too much, they're disappointed and if you don't give them any clues, they get confused. So it's that fine line of giving the audience as they walk out, okay, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> this or <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> that. We never gave more in the script." ...|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece for Foreign Policy, Max Boot {{outlines}} his views thusly: [...] "I am socially liberal: I am pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-abortion rights, pro-immigration. I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Michael Morell, former deputy {{director}} and twice {{acting director of}} the Central Intelligence Agency, resigned as a nonresident senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] Morell wrote, [...] "I cannot be part of an organization—The Kennedy School—that honors a convicted felon and leaker of classified information … the Kennedy School's decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence, an attempt that may encourage others to leak classified information as well." [...] Later that day, CIA director Mike Pompeo advised the university that he supported Morell's decision, and withdrew from his scheduled public appearance that evening at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Calling Manning an [...] "American traitor," [...] Pompeo wrote, [...] "While I have served my country as a soldier in the United States Army and will continue to defend Ms. Manning's right to offer a defense of why she chose this path, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is shameful for Harvard to place its stamp of approval upon her treasonous actions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--yes. <b>I</b> {{could hardly}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> at the time. <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> now, so I'm going back this afternoon to make quite sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's at Farnley, in Dorsetshire. Doctor South. You'd {{have to go}} down at once; his {{assistant}} has developed mumps. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> a very pleasant place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{at present}} {{it is like}} a nightmare," [...] he replied. [...] "We went from place to place and I preached the new salvation. I told them to trust in me and I would lead them to the light. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> Though the way I knew must be strewn with difficulties, though there were great risks and much suffering, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> saw the dawn of the millennium. <b>I</b> made them <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> saw <b>it.</b> They placed their trust in me. I have led them to the brink of God knows what!" ...|$|R
