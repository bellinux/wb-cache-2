The H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 -gas mixture is exhaust gas obtained from a hydrocarbon combustion process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The process for reforming hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon mixtures (educts) in hydrogen and carbon mono-oxide/their product gas, comprises mixing the <b>educt</b> (3) in first mixing stage (3) with oxygen containing gas mixture, mixing the mixture from the first mixing stage (4) with gas mixture containing oxygen, water (H 2 O), nitrogen (N 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), in a second mixing stage (4), and reacting the mixture of hydrocarbon oxidation with a catalyst in a reactor (1). The H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 -gas mixture are exhaust gas obtained from a hydrocarbon combustion process. The exhaust gas mixture contains 10 - 15 vol. % of carbon dioxide, 10 - 13 vol. % of water, 0 - 5 vol. % of oxygen and 73 - 75 vol. % of nitrogen. The exhaust gas mixture is subjected to pre-combustion process before the supply to the hydrocarbon educts. An Ambient air is supplied for the first- and the second mixing stage. A diesel fuel is used as the hydrocarbon <b>educt.</b> The hydrocarbon <b>educt</b> exhibits 40 - 60 degreesC, before the mixing in the first stage. The temperature of the O 2 containing gas mixture is 15 - 25 degreesC and H 2 O, N 2, CO 2 and O 2 containing gas mixture is 400 - 500 degreesC. The hydrocarbon oxidation is carried in the reactor at 850 - 1000 degreesC and at 0 - 10 bar. The ratio between the hydrocarbon <b>educt</b> to the oxygen containing gas mixture is 0. 31 : 0. 41, which {{is defined by the}} air number lambda (= actually supplied oxygen quantity/oxygen quantity required for the total oxidation). The ratio of the hydrocarbon <b>educt</b> to the H 2 O, N 2, CO 2 and O 2 containing gas mixture is 0. 25 : 0. 5, which is defined by a S/C (steam to carbon) ratio (= amount of material at water vapor in supplied gas mixture/amount of material at carbon atoms in the fuel <b>educt).</b> The ratio of S:C for both mixing stages is 0. 2 - 0. 5.

40|$|A {{chemical}} reaction {{is a process}} of transforming one set of molecules (educts) into another set (products). In the course of a reaction, chemical bonds which hold the atoms together are redistributed, so that each atom in a reaction <b>educt</b> appears in a specific position of a reaction product. Tracing atoms between educts and products refers to a non-trivial problem in computational chemistry and system biology, namely the “Atom Mapping Problem”. Our determination of atom mappings relies on the existence of an imaginary transition state (ITS), in which reacting bonds (formed, broken) are arranged in a cyclic topology. Cyclic mechanisms are very common in chemistry and almost all elementary homovalent and ambivalent reactions feature a cyclic ITS. The used approach aims at the identification of the cyclic ITS, that imposes additional restrictions on the bijection between <b>educt</b> and product atoms. Once the cyclic ITS is fixed, the overall mapping is easily derived. For this purpose we use Constraint Programming and we show that it is a very promising approach to solve the atom mapping task.
