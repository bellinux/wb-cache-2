50|$|During {{the early}} nineteenth century, large numbers of Dutch <b>farmers,</b> <b>forced</b> by high taxes and low wages, started immigrating to America. They mainly settled down in the Midwest, {{especially}} Michigan, Illinois and Iowa. In the 1840s, Calvinist immigrants desiring more religious freedom immigrated. West Michigan in particular has become associated with Dutch American culture, and the highly conservative influence of the Dutch Reformed Church, centering on the cities of Holland and (to a lesser extent) Grand Rapids.|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} been farmed since the Iron Age, and remains of those farms can still be seen, {{including}} the farmers' stone walls.

The original village of Degerhorn was emptied out by Gustav Vasa and the <b>farmers</b> <b>forced</b> out in the 1550s; in its stead he built a model farm which also produced for the royal stores {{at a time when the}} entire island was a royal hunting domain.|$|R

By 1473, trade {{had declined to}} the point that Quanzhou was no longer the headquarters of the imperial customs service for Fujian. The [...] "Japanese" [...] or [...] "dwarf" [...] pirates, most of whom were actually disaffected Chinese, forced Quanzhou's Superintendency of Trade to close completely in 1522. The Sea Ban that followed did not help the city's traders or fishermen: they were forced to abandon their access to the sea for years at a time and coastal <b>farmers</b> <b>forced</b> to relocate miles inland.|$|R

30|$|Agriculture still consumes 77 {{per cent}} of the water, {{especially}} in the arid north, an area greatly affected by climate change (CC). Industry uses ten per cent and domestic users thirteen per cent of water. The growing megacities are also overexploiting their aquifers, producing subsidence and water pollution together with changes in land use, thus reducing water infiltration into the aquifers during the monsoon. Regional and temporal water stress is further aggravated by unsustainable production processes, where mining and agribusiness hog the water needed by indigenous people and small <b>farmers,</b> <b>forcing</b> them to migrate to the urban centres or illegally to the US.|$|R
5000|$|Larson here redeems {{the term}} [...] "market revolution" [...] from the {{treatment}} accorded it by Charles Sellers....Sellers reified the market revolution, {{making it an}} actor in his story—indeed, its villain. Sellers's wicked [...] "Market" [...] ruined the lives of happy subsistence <b>farmers,</b> <b>forcing</b> {{their sons and daughters}} to become a proletariat in the service of a repressive bourgeoisie. By contrast, Larson shows how the market revolution was made by the people themselves, bit by unwitting bit. His own stance toward this process is richly ironic and nuanced; he never fails to point out ambiguities and paradoxes.|$|R
5000|$|This {{view was}} echoed by bioethicist Michael Reiss and moral philosopher Roger Straughan who explain {{in their book}} Improving Nature?: The Science and Ethics of Genetic Engineering that fears about the {{consolidation}} of power by a few agrochemical companies over farmers is a main argument against new genetic engineering technology in agriculture: [...] "At its extreme, this fear belongs to the conspiracy-theory genre and, to caricature somewhat, envisages powerless <b>farmers</b> <b>forced</b> to pay ever increasing amounts to anonymous international companies who profit from {{the cost of the}} crop seed and from the cost of the herbicides used to spray them." ...|$|R

30|$|This {{transition}} {{may be due}} to {{the breakdown}} of viable exchange relations between pastoralists and local <b>farmers,</b> <b>forcing</b> the Fulani to acquire land and grow their own food, instead of getting it from farmers in exchange for dairy products and manure. It may also simply be a natural income diversification strategy enabled by the long-term settlement of the Fulani in this area. This is almost certainly the case in the 23 % of households who own large amounts of land and sell most of their crops for cash. However, it is likely that the former reason is responsible for the widespread uptake of arable agriculture observed. It is interesting to note that the Fulani, along with local farmers, mostly grow crops that provide little or no residues (hay and threshed grain heads) for animals to graze.|$|R
