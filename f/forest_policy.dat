Nepal has a {{long history}} of returning public forests to local people as part of its community forestry programme. In principle the community forestry programme is designed to address both environmental quality and poverty alleviation. However, concern has been expressed that <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> emphasise environmental conservation, and that this has a detrimental impact on the use of community forests in rural Nepal where households require access to public forest products to sustain livelihoods. To study the effect of government <b>policies</b> on <b>forest</b> use, an economic model of a typical small community of economically heterogeneous households in Nepal was developed. The model incorporates a link between private agriculture and public forest resources, and uses this link to assess the socioeconomic impacts of <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> on the use of public forests. Socioeconomic impacts were measured in terms of household income, employment and income inequality. The results show that some <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> have a negative economic impact, and the impacts are more serious than those reported by other studies. This study shows that existing <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> reduce household income and employment, and widen income inequalities within communities, compared to alternative <b>policies.</b> Certain <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> even constrain the poorest households’ ability to meet survival needs. The findings indicate that the socioeconomic impacts of public <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> may be underestimated in developing countries unless household economic heterogeneity and forestry’s contribution to production are accounted for. The study also demonstrates that alternative policies for managing common property resources would reduce income inequalities in rural Nepalese communities and lift incomes and employment to a level where even the poorest households could meet their basic needs...|$|R
25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National <b>Forest</b> <b>Policy,</b> which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National <b>Forest</b> <b>Policy</b> noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2008. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Many {{studies have suggested}} various kinds of <b>forest</b> <b>policies,</b> management planning and practices to help forests adapt to climate change.

We argue that policy and management recommendations aimed at integrating adaptation into national <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> and practices in Africa should start with an inventory and careful examination of existing policies and practices {{in order to understand}} the nature and extent of intervention required to influence the adaptation of forest ecosystems to climate change. This paper aims to contribute to closing this gap in knowledge detrimental to decision making through the review and analysis of current <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> and practices in Burkina Faso and Ghana and highlighting elements that have the potential to influence the adaptation of forest ecosystems to climate change. The analysis revealed that adaptation (and mitigation) are not part of current <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> in Burkina Faso and Ghana, but instead policies contain elements of risk management practices which are also relevant to the adaptation of forest ecosystems. Some of these elements are found in policies on th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> {{concerned with}} the adequate provision of forest related externalities. Despite {{the use of the}} forest vocation land (FVL) in the legislation of many Latin American countries, the discussion in the scientific literature about <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> based on it is modest. This paper seeks to contribute to this debate. The paper presents facts, defines concepts, examines analytical frameworks, and investigates policy alternatives related to these externalities in private lands. The paper concludes that FVL is a useful model for the design of <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> that seek to assure the provision of forest related externalities. Such policies are: especially adequate for developing countries because they are relatively easy to understand; are less intrusive in the forest business decision making processes and, thereby, allow for greater freedom of action; are less costly to monitor, enforce, and comply with; reduce corruptive activities and illegality associated with forests; and do not require adjustments as technologies and market conditions change. ...|$|R
50|$|The Fourth National Forest Plan {{entered a}} {{transitional}} phase of <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> from mainly focusing economic functions to enhancing overall forest benefits including public and recreational benefits.

The KFS put special emphasis on developing valuable forest resources and fostering competitive forestry industry, thereby increasing public benefits for the people. The government-led <b>forest</b> management <b>policies</b> turned into autonomic forest management in the private forest sector, based on the capability and discretion of forest owners. To achieve implementing objectives for sustainable forest management, the KFS consolidated legal and institutional systems by newly enacting the Framework Act on Forest, the Act on Promotion and Management of Forest Resources, the Act on the National Forest Management, the Act on Forest Culture and Recreation and the Act on Promotion of Forestry and Mountain Villages.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} evaluate past <b>forest</b> management <b>policies</b> and property rights regimes in achieving sustainability of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) in Bangladesh. The adequacy of <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> to reflect regimes of property rights in their design and implementation is examined using content analysis. The analysis synthesises <b>forest</b> <b>policies</b> of four distinct historical time periods, and the embedding of property rights during those periods using Schlager and Ostrom's typology. The findings reveal the inadequacy of the existing state property rights regime to secure the livelihood of 3. 5 million people in marginalised and disadvantaged forest-dependent communities, and to achieve sustainability in the SMF by reversing the trend of rapid reduction of forest resources. The challenge, therefore, is to find an alternative property rights regime to address the missing link between conservation and livelihood-security of forest-dependent communities using sustainable management practices in the SMF. ...|$|R
