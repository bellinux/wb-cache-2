40|$|This {{comprehensive}} review {{provides an overview}} about placebo and nocebo phenomena in antidepressant trials. Improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> may partly be explained through methodological issues such as natural course of depression and regression to the mean, but also fundamentally reflect investigators' and participants' expectations. A meta-analysis by our group of 96 randomized placebo-controlled trials showed large placebo responses to antidepressant medication. Moderator analyses revealed substantially larger placebo responses in observer ratings compared with self-report. Effect sizes in observer ratings showed strong increase with publication year while this effect was not found for patients' self-ratings. This reflects the strong influence of investigators' expectations. The analysis of ‘nocebo effects’, e. g. adverse effects in <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of antidepressant trials also confirms the impact of expectations: nocebo symptoms reflected the typical side-effect patterns expected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drug group, with higher symptoms rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of tricyclic antidepressant trials compared with <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of trials testing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. While <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> response seems to be similar for women and men, gender differences were found for nocebo rates. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> conclusion, we discuss potential implications for clinical trial designs and argue for interventions aimed at optimizing positive expectations of treatment benefit while minimizing the impact of adverse effects...|$|R

25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>group,</b> and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk.

2500|$|It was {{previously}} assumed that placebo response rates {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, [...] "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition.

The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood {{to be difficult to}} treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>group.</b> Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response.

As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds. Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage. [...] Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure (renal failure).

In 2009 Becker et al. reported on a U.S. trial that enrolled 62 patients with known statin-associated myalgias. Half got a RYR product (3600mg/day, 13mg monacolins, 6mg monacolin k) for 24 weeks; and half were administered a placebo. In the treated group, LDL-cholesterol declined 21%.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{provide an}} {{accurate}} {{estimation of the}} magnitude of effect of lithium in short-term efficacy studies conducted in patients with moderate to severe manic episode. METHODS: All placebo-controlled randomized studies submitted to the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) in which lithium was used as the third study arm were selected for the meta-analysis. The studies were part of registration files submitted to the MEB between the years 1997 and 2005. In addition, Medline and EMbase searches were conducted with the key words 'manic' ('mania' for the EMbase search) and 'placebo' in order to identify additional placebo-controlled studies of lithium. This search was updated until March 1, 2006. Two effect size indicators were used based on the primary outcome measure of each study: Cohen's standardized effect size based on <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> mean change from baseline, and numbers needed to treat (NNT) based on <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> treatment response defined as >or= 50 % improvement from baseline on day 21. RESULTS: Six studies were identified.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{meta-analysis}} of the efficacy results from 3 placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials of slow-release mesalamine (Pentasa) for the acute treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease. METHODS: Three trials fulfilled the selection criteria (double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies in adult patients treated with Pentasa 4 g/day for active Crohn's disease). The efficacy and safety was evaluated in these trials by using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) as the primary efficacy variable. The study duration was 16 weeks in all 3 trials. The total numbers of patients were 304 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pentasa 4 -g/day treatment <b>groups</b> and 311 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups.</b> A meta-analysis was performed based on the study reports. RESULTS: For <b>the</b> intent-to-treat patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pentasa groups, the overall mean reduction of the CDAI from baseline to the final visit was - 63 points. The corresponding CDAI change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> was - 45 points; the net difference was - 18 points. Compared with <b>placebo,</b> <b>the</b> 4 -g/day dose of Pentasa was associated with a statistically significant overall improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CDAI from baseline to the final visit (P = 0. 04). When the meta-analysis was restricted to protocol correct patients, the effect of Pentasa became more pronounced (overall mean reduction of - 83 CDAI points; P = 0. 02, compared with <b>placebo).</b> Contrary to <b>the</b> consistent effects with Pentasa, the trial-specific reductions of <b>the</b> CDAI with <b>placebo</b> differed significantly between the trials. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis of 3 large, double-blind, randomized studies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of active Crohn's disease confirms that Pentasa 4 g/day is superior to <b>placebo</b> <b>in</b> reducing <b>the</b> CDAI but the clinical significance of the magnitude of this difference is not clear...|$|R

They were assessed {{on the basis}} of symptoms and endoscopy examination. Ulcer healing observed by endoscopy was significantly better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TDB treated group (18 of 20) than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> treated <b>group</b> (six of 17). There was no statistical difference in symptomatic improvement. Nineteen patients with duodenal ulcers proved by endoscopy were randomized in a double-blind trial and given TDB and a placebo for four weeks. Ulcer healing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TDB treated group (eight of nine) was significantly better than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> treated <b>group</b> (two of 10). No significant difference was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> symptomatic improvement of both groups. It is concluded that TDB is an effective agent for the treatment of chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY This study {{compares the}} effect of the {{combination}} of octreotide plus methylprednisolone with octreotide and placebo on biochemical and clinical parameters of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograpy (ERCP) induced pancreatitis. Two hundred and twenty two patients were randomised to receive either octreotide plus methylprednisolone, octreotide or placebo. There was no difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> median serum amylase at 2 to 24 hours after ERCP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three groups. Clinical pancreatitis, developed in 11 patients -one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> octretode plus methylprednisolone, four <b>in</b> <b>the</b> octretode and six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups,</b> although there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups. This study suggests a tendency that octreotide plus methylprednisolone may protect against ERCP- induced pancreatitis.
