In the early 1970s, Pinheiro {{became a member of}} the Confederation of Agricultural Workers, supported by the Catholic Church, through which he and Mendes began to set up human blockades, a technique known in Portuguese as the <b>empate.</b> The first <b>empate</b> took place in March 1976 in a rubber estate near Brasileia, when 60 men spent three days in trenches in order to stop logging. In the words of Chico Mendes, [...] "They put themselves in front of the chain saws, and the workmen retreated. They were afraid. There was an enormous pressure afterward from the authorities, but from there on, it proved to be the only way." [...] These protests were nonviolent, and some claim that they but had limited success. They did, however, attract international attention to the plight of the rubber tappers. Unfortunately, the ranchers responded very violently. They even used the local police to threaten, torture and kill many of union members.|$|E

On December 13, 2016, philologist Ahmadou <b>Empaté</b> Bâ published an article in Les Mots et les Lettres questioning Lefrère's method, mainly by demonstrating that the distinction between poets and poetasters is not as obvious as one may be led to believe by his reasoning.|$|E

Vários pesquisadores procuram quantificar essa vantagem no futebol internacional, porém quando se trata de futebol brasileiro, poucos estudos se dedicaram à pesquisa nessa área. Devido a isso, o presente estudo teve como objetivo comparar a VC no Campeonato Brasileiro das Séries A e B. Foram analisadas todas as partidas nas condições de vitórias, <b>empates</b> e derrotas em casa, das temporadas 2003 a 2009, tanto na série A quanto na série B. Para quantificar a VC, foi utilizada a metodologia de aproveitamento percentual de pontos, proposto por POLLARD (1986). Foi encontrada uma VC maior na Série B (69 ± 2, 3 %) em relação à Série A (65 ± 2, 3) (p The Home Advantage (HA) {{has been}} an important object of study in world football. Several researchers have sought to quantify HA in the international soccer, {{but when it comes to}} Brazilian soccer, few studies have been devoted to research in this area. The present study aimed at comparing the HA in the Brazilian Championship Series A and B. All the games were analyzed in terms of wins, draws and defeats at home, in the seasons from 2003 to 2009 in both series A and series B. To quantify the HA, we used the method of recovery percentage points, proposed by POLLARD (1986). There was a greater HA in Series B (69 ± 2. 3 %) compared to Series A (65 ± 2. 3) (p < 0. 05). It was concluded that, in Series B of the Brazilian Championship, the factor "play at home" has greater advantage than in the Brazilian Series A season...|$|R

Seu objetivo {{principal}} foi analisar a importância relativa dos stakeholders das Instituições de Ensino Superior (IES) para o Desempenho Social Corporativo, segundo a percepção dos Gestores das IES Brasileiras. Como objetivos secundários, identificou aspectos da Teoria dos Stakeholders segundo a percepção dos Gestores, como a Distribuição de Recursos e Geração de Valor, a Gestão para Stakeholders e a Saliência de Stakeholders, e analisou as percepções sobre os stakeholders de acordo com o perfil do respondente e o perfil da IES no qual o respondente atua como Gestor. Após a validação de um questionário do tipo survey por especialistas, o instrumento foi enviado por e-mail para 2. 391 IES Brasileiras. Foram obtidas 88 respostas completas. Foi possível identificar diferenças na importância relativa dos stakeholders de acordo com os diferentes aspectos pesquisados - no geral, maior importância relativa para Corpo Docente, Corpo Discente e Corpo Técnico-Administrativo, e menor para Fornecedores. No que tange à satisfação dos stakeholders para com as IES, proxy de Desempenho Social Corporativo, houve <b>empate</b> técnico entre os stakeholders.
