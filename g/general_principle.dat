For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E

50|$|The <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of European Union law {{are rules}} of law which a European Union judge, sitting {{for example in}} the European Court of Justice, has to find and apply but not create. The European Community Treaty (EC Treaty) {{expressly}} allows European Union judges to apply <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> common {{to the laws of}} Member States when determining the non-contractual liability of the European Community. In practice the European Court of Justice has applied <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> to all aspects of European Union law. In formulating <b>general</b> <b>principles,</b> European Union judges draw on a variety of sources, including: public international law and its <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> inherent to all legal systems; national laws of the member states, that is <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> common to the laws of all member states, <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> inferred from European Union law, and fundamental human rights. <b>General</b> <b>principles</b> are found and applied to avoid the denial of justice, fill gaps in European Union law and to strengthen the coherence of European Union law.|$|R
40|$|Without {{pretending to}} {{describe}} and discuss the longstanding doctrinal debate on <b>general</b> <b>principles,</b> this chapter aims at exploring some controversial issues concerning the process of principles-generation, including {{the question of the}} consensual or non-consensual nature of this source of law and the question of the autonomy of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> from other sources of international law. It also addresses the role of international courts and tribunals in the determination and application of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as well as the role of states in promoting the use of <b>general</b> <b>principles.</b> The authors submit that lawmaking by <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> is a hybrid process which combines consensual and non-consensual elements. In particular, while the determination of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> inevitably accords certain discretion to the interpreter, such discretion does not mean complete detachment from state consent...|$|R
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent <b>general</b> <b>principle</b> of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like O(h²). It is generally {{faster than the}} Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same <b>general</b> <b>principle</b> as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the <b>general</b> <b>principle</b> was that landlords were not liable for {{injuries}} suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E

50|$|The <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of European Union law are <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of {{law which}} are applied by the European Court of Justice and the {{national}} courts of the member states when determining the lawfulness of legislative and administrative measures within the European Union. <b>General</b> <b>principles</b> of European Union law may be derived from common legal principles in the various EU member states, or <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> found in international law or European Union law. Amongst others the European Court of Justice has recognised fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity as <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of European Union law. <b>General</b> <b>principles</b> of law should be distinguished from rules of law as <b>principles</b> are more <b>general</b> and open-ended {{in the sense that}} they need to be honed to be applied to specific cases with correct results.|$|R
40|$|This article reassesses {{the legal}} {{character}} of ‘the <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law recognized by civilized nations’, {{being one of}} the two unwritten sources of international law. The <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law are, however, the most controversial source of international law and have continued to divide the opinions of scholars and judges alike since their inception. Some view them as private law analogies, others as emanations of natural law and there are those who conflate them with custom. This article seeks to identify the appropriate methodology for ascertaining the existence of the controversial ‘general principles of law’. It does so by going back to the preparatory works of Article 38 (1) (c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice and then critically assessing the practice of states and the case law of the Court on identifying <b>general</b> <b>principles.</b> It will be argued that <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law are an important source of international law in their own right with a systemic function in the international legal order and a distinct methodology for their ascertainment. Three categories of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> will be distinguished based on the nuanced methodologies for their ascertainment applied by the International Court of Justice and its predecessor, namely, <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of international law, <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of domestic law and <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of procedural law.

5|$|A <b>general</b> <b>principle</b> {{concerning}} dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("where {{there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is}} a collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, we {{will deal}} {{with the role of}} ‘general {{principles}} of law recognized by the major legal systems of the world’ as a source of international criminal law. ‘General principles of law’ have been identified and used as a source of law by international tribunals since the adoption of the Statute of the PCIJ in 1920 and have been used to fill gaps in international law with regard to issues on which no treaty or customary rules exist. In the field of international criminal law, <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> have also been identified as a source of law, and used for the same purpose, in the jurisprudence of the ICTY and the ICTR and in the Statute of the ICC. Despite numerous international tribunals having recourse to <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> when identifying applicable law, a ‘certain mysticism’ attaches to them and many questions remain as to how <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> can, and should be used, to clarify and develop international law. In particular, uncertainty persists with regard to how <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> are to be identified and which techniques should be implemented to extract <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> from principles of domestic law. While general sources of law have the potential to play a very important {{role in the development of}} international criminal law by avoiding situations of non liquet, without clarification as to how such principles are to be identified, the full potential of this source of law cannot be exploited, which can impede the development and evolution of international criminal law. This chapter focuses on the use of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as a source of international criminal law and focuses on how international tribunals have dealt with the issue of identifying <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> through a review of national laws. Section 1 of the chapter provides a brief analysis of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as a source of public international law and discusses how the ad hoc tribunals have used <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as a source in their jurisprudence, with a particular focus on the tribunals’ approach in identifying <b>general</b> <b>principles.</b> Section 2 then focuses on Article 21 of the ICC Statute which outlines the applicable law of the court and analyses how <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> fit into the hierarchy of sources set out in this provision. This chapter also provides an analysis of the methodology the court uses in identifying <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> in the early jurisprudence of the ICC. The chapter concludes with some thoughts on how <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> can be better exploited to ensure the continuous and dynamic development of international criminal law at the ICC...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, I {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between customary international law and <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law. Both are distinct sources of public international law (Art. 38 (1) (b) and (c) of the Statue of the International Court of Justice). In a first step, I analyze the different meanings of principles as a “source” of international law. Second, I consider different approaches to principles as a norm type in legal theory. Third, I discuss attempts in international legal doctrine to facilitate conceptual issues by either unifying <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as a source with the source of customary international law or by equating <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> as a source and as a norm type. Finally, I propose that the delimitation between customary international law and <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law as sources of international law should follow the distinction between situations dominated by factual reciprocity (which justify customary norms) and situations where such factual reciprocity is absent (which justify <b>general</b> <b>principles).</b> The jurisgenerative processes leading to the emergence of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of international law are processes of changing identities and argumentative self-entrapment...|$|R
40|$|<b>General</b> <b>principles</b> of law are {{a primary}} {{mechanism}} for “gap-filling” in international criminal law. However, their interpretation by tribunals has been fitful, contradictory, and misguided.

This Article critiques the various conceptions of <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> developed by scholars and tribunals based on the criteria of formal and material validity and exposes the problems with their application in light of comparative law and criminal law theory. The Article challenges international criminal tribunals’ reliance on surveys of municipal legal rules as the primary tool for the derivation of <b>general</b> <b>principles.</b> It recommends a more limited role for <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> focused on material validity in the development of international criminal law. Additionally, it urges tribunals to engage with other sources, especially treaties, to alleviate the problem of gaps in international criminal law...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of law may fall into all three categories of sources of law. <b>General</b> <b>principles</b> of domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are <b>general</b> <b>principles</b> of international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. <b>General</b> <b>principles</b> of the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like.
