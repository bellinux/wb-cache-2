50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> {{are divided}} into two types: Two-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> or four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units.</b> Two-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe {{supplies}} either cold or hot water to the unit depending {{on the time of}} year. Four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe fan coil unit is most commonly used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> are an {{excellent}} delivery mechanism for hydronic chiller boiler systems in large residential and light commercial applications. In these applications the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> are mounted in bathroom ceilings {{and can be used}} to provide unlimited comfort zones - with the ability to turn off unused areas of the structure to save energy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason that}} these DC <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Units</b> are, despite their {{apparent}} relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels {{compared to their}} AC motor driven counterparts {{of only a few}} years ago. A straight swap, AC to DC, will reduce electrical consumption by 50% but applying Demand and Occupancy dependent fan speed control can take the savings to as much as 80%. In areas of the world where there are legally enforceable energy efficiency requirements for Fan Coils (such as the UK), DC <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Units</b> are rapidly becoming the only choice.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master of Science Thesis was {{to develop}} an MS Excel-based {{calculation}} tool for cooling and heating capacities in Halton Group´s new product, the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit.</b> The <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> is commonly used in passenger cabins of cruisers to cool or heat the cabin air. The number of customer orders of the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> has been increasing, therefore, Halton Group’s subdivision Marine had a need to get this tool to save time, which had earlier gone to calculations for each unit order separately. Cooling demand consists of two kinds of heat loads: latent and sensible heat load. The part of the heat load which is caused by evaporation, is called the latent heat load. The latent heat load comes from for example the cabin, when the passenger's skin is sweating and from the shower facilities when water vapor is released into the cabin air. Sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system that has as its sole effect a change of temperature. This Thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part will offer a basic theoretical background for the features that will be dealt with in the second part. The basic principles of <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit,</b> heat transfer properties between air and water and other mathematical functions that have been used in this work are presented in the first part. The structure of the calculation tool and operations manual, are presented in the second part. As a result of this work, the calculation tool was developed and found to be appropriate for designing as well as improving the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{concealed}} <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> will typically {{be installed}} within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The {{return air grille}} and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted {{to and from the}} <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a return air plenum.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{simplicity}} and flexibility, <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> {{can be more}} economical to install than ducted 100% fresh air systems (VAV) or central heating systems with air handling units or chilled beams. Various unit configurations are available, including horizontal (ceiling mounted) or vertical (floor mounted).|$|E
50|$|Small air handlers, {{for local}} use, are called {{terminal}} units, and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called blower coils or <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units.</b> A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, {{is known as}} a makeup air unit (MAU). An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, {{is known as a}} packaged unit (PU) or rooftop unit (RTU).|$|E
50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> {{circulate}} hot or {{cold water}} through a coil in order to condition a space. The unit gets its {{hot or cold}} water from a central plant, or mechanical room containing equipment for removing heat from the central building's closed-loop. The equipment used can consist of machines used to remove heat such as a chiller or a cooling tower and equipment for adding heat to the building's water such as a boiler or a commercial water heater.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> (FCU) is {{a simple}} device {{consisting}} of a heating and/or cooling heat exchanger or 'coil' and fan. It {{is part of an}} HVAC system found in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. A <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> is a diverse device sometimes using ductwork, and is used to control the temperature in the space where it is installed, or serve multiple spaces. It is controlled either by a manual on/off switch or by a thermostat, which controls the throughput of water to the heat exchanger using a control valve and/or the fan speed.|$|R
50|$|A unit {{ventilator}} is a <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> {{that is used}} {{mainly in}} classrooms, hotels, apartments and condominium applications. A unit ventilator can be a wall mounted or ceiling hung cabinet, and is designed to use a fan to blow outside air across a coil, thus conditioning and ventilating the space which it is serving.|$|R
5000|$|In this setup, {{there is}} an outdoor air system that dumps preconditioned air (accounting for latent load and partial {{sensible}} load) directly into the space in its own duct/diffuser. There is a separate system (e.g. <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit)</b> that takes air from the space and conditions it to meet the remaining space sensible load.|$|R
50|$|A year-long {{trial of}} a {{groundwater}} cooling system began in June 2006 at Victoria station. If successful the trial will be extended to 30 other deep-level stations. For this trial Metronet installed London South Bank University's system comprising three <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> which use water that has seeped into the tunnels and is pumped from the tunnels to absorb the heat after which it is discharged in the sewer system. The scheme {{was one of the}} winners in the Carbon Trust's 2007 Innovation Awards.|$|E
5000|$|The 0-10 Volt {{signal voltage}} can be set via a simple {{potentiometer}} and left or the 0-10 Volt signal {{voltage can be}} delivered to the fan motors by the terminal controller {{on each of the}} <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Units.</b> The former is very simple and cheap but the latter opens up the opportunity to continuously alter the fan speed depending on various external conditions/influences. These conditions/criteria could be the 'real time' demand for either heating or cooling, occupancy levels, window switches, time clocks or any number of other inputs from either the unit itself, the Building Management System or both.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} any {{engineering}} {{project is to}} anticipate a need and meet that need through prediction analysis and design. Over 70 % of the nation’s energy is consumed by building infrastructure such as HVAC systems, electrical, etc. HVAC systems use boilers to generate hot water or steam to heat buildings and chillers to provide cold water for cooling. The overall solar evaporative <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> project involves the design and construction {{of a system that}} will heat and cool air using a solar collector and an evaporative chiller. This report covers the design and construction of the evaporative chiller specifically. The evaporator harnesses the latent heat of vaporization to chill a fin tube heat exchanger which can then provide chilled water to an air handling device called a <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit.</b> Testing will consider input and output water temperature, relative humidity, as well as input and output air temperature in order to compare the changes and develop a value for efficiency of the system.

40|$|AbstractRadiant cooling is an {{alternative}} air-conditioning that havs been implemented successfully in high latitude regions. In tropical region as Thailand, radiant cooling is quite challenge due to its cooling performance being limited by high-moisture ambient air. This paper reports an investigation of radiant cooling in a tropical building. The study comprises full-scale experiments of a radiant cooling system with cool panels installed in a room of a laboratory building. A separate <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> was installed to remove humidity of the ventilation air before suppluying it into the room. A software namely TRNSYS was used to model the systems {{in order to determine}} the heat extraction rate of the cool panels. Thermal comfort level in the room was evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) index. The results show that the radiant cooling is able to use for air conditioning for human comfort in tropical buildings. However, a sophistical system to control temperature of the chilled water supplied to the cool panels and the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> for the ventilation air dehumidification is inevitably required...|$|R
50|$|The coil {{receives}} hot or {{cold water}} from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through heat transfer. Traditionally <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> can contain their own internal thermostat, or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a Building Energy Management System (BEMS), {{the control of the}} fan coil unit will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.|$|E
50|$|The main {{building}} of the Mailman School of Public Health, the Allan Rosenfield Building, was constructed in 1930. It is located at 1050 Riverside Drive in the Columbia University Medical Campus. The building, named after Allan Rosenfield, the long-time Dean of the Mailman School of Public Health {{and one of the}} giants in the world of public health, has been recently renovated to create an energy-efficient, environmentally-considered fit-out.  The new space was designed  to extend natural light as much as possible, and to do so in an energy-efficient manner.  Other sustainable features include efficient lighting with occupancy sensors, Energy Star office equipment and appliances, high efficiency <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units,</b> water conserving fixtures achieving over a 30% water usage reduction, and low/no VOC building materials and low-emitting furniture systems.|$|E
50|$|Mixing systems {{generally}} {{supply air}} {{such that the}} supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity. In cooling mode, the cool supply air, typically around 55 °F (13 °C) (saturated) at design conditions, exits an outlet at high velocity. The high velocity supply air stream causes turbulence causing the room air to mix with the supply air. Because the entire room is near-fully mixed, temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room. Diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply air stream. Most often, the air outlets and inlets are placed in the ceiling. Supply diffusers in the ceiling are fed by <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> in the ceiling void or by air handling units in a remote plant room. The fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the ceiling void and mix this with fresh air and cool, or heat it, as required to achieve the room design conditions. This arrangement is known as 'conventional room air distribution'.|$|E
50|$|In {{high-rise}} residential construction, typically each <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>unit</b> {{requires a}} rectangular through-penetration {{in the concrete}} slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or {{at least on the}} chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.|$|R
50|$|DC motors {{allow the}} speed of the fans within a <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> to be {{controlled}} by means of a 0-10 Volt input 'Signal' to the motor/s, the transformers and speed switches associated with AC <b>Fan</b> <b>Coils</b> are not required. Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. <b>Fan</b> <b>Coils</b> will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> is likely to be too noisy for most commercial applications.|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} of cooling-based dehumidification, which can perform both dehumidification and cooling, can be considered. Supplementary cooling equipment with dehumidification can also be considered, which {{uses the same}} heat transfer medium, {{in order to avoid}} {{an increase in the number}} and kinds of heat sources. Therefore, the <b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> (FCU) was selected as the additional system for dehumidification and supplementary cooling, because the FCU is typical equipment that uses water as the heat transfer medium, as does the radiant panel, and adopts the cooling-based dehumidification.|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the London Underground's {{ventilation}} fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels and the recent system on the Jubilee line extension was designed to allow cooling of the tubes at night. Fans over the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night. Following a successful demonstration of a heat pump in 2001 funds {{were given to the}} School of Engineering at London's London South Bank University to develop a prototype; work began in April 2002. A prize of £100,000 was offered by the Mayor of London during the hot summer of 2003 for a solution to the problem, but the competition ended in 2005 without a winner. A year-long trial of a groundwater cooling system began in June 2006 at Victoria station. The University's system comprised three <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> <b>units</b> that use water that has seeped into the tunnels and is pumped from the tunnels to absorb the heat after which it is discharged in the sewer system. The scheme was one of the winners in the Carbon Trust's 2007 Innovation Awards. In 2012 air cooling units were installed on platforms at Green Park station using cool deep ground water and at Oxford Circus using chiller units at the top of an adjacent building. New air-conditioned trains are being introduced on the sub-surface lines, but space is limited on tube trains for air-conditioning units and these would heat the tunnels even more. The Deep Tube Programme, investigating replacing the trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, is looking for trains with better energy conservation and regenerative braking.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>Coil</b> <b>Unit</b> design falls principally {{into two}} main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, {{in the first}} type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, {{and in the other}} type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are {{considered}} thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.|$|R
