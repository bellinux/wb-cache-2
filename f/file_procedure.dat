40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} orbital polyacrylamide gel injection for the correction of anophthalmic enophthalmos. Methods: Noncontrolled clinical trial of 21 patients (14 with ocular implants, 5 with phthisis bulbi, and 2 with dermis-fat graft). Orbital CT was performed to estimate the volume of polyacrylamide gel needed to restore orbital volume. Polyacrylamide gel was injected using a 22 -gauge (30 x 0. 7 min) needle transcutaneously inserted in the lateral third of the lower eyelid, directed to the orbital muscle cone. A second injection was administered 15 days later. if necessary. CT was repeated 30 days after the last procedure. Exophthalmometry was performed before Bind 90 days after <b>file</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results: The mean total volume injected per orbit was 2. 4 +/- 0. 7 ml (range 1 - 3. 5 ml). The volume of the enophthalmic orbit increased front 26. 9 +/- 5. 0 ml to 29. 3 +/- 4. 9 ml (p < 0. 001). The mean difference in exophthalmometry readings was 3. 3 +/- 1. 6 mm (range, 1. 5 - 8. 0 mm) before the procedure and 1. 0 +/- 0. 9 mm (range, 0. 0 - 3. 0 mm) after 3 months (p < 0. 001). Adjustment of the ocular prosthesis or fabrication of a new one was necessary in 11 patients (52. 4 %), and the mean volume of the ocular prosthesis was reduced front 2. 0 +/- 0. 6 ml to 1. 6 +/- 0. 6 ml (p = 0. 003). All patients {{were satisfied with the}} aesthetic results. No serious adverse events were observed. The initial results were maintained 1 year after the procedure. Conclusions: Polyacrylamide gel injection in the orbital space effectively reduces enophthalmos in ocular prosthesis wearers...|$|E
