5|$|Douglas Engelbart, {{the founder}} of SRI's Augmentation Research Center (ARC), was the primary force behind the design and {{development}} of the multi-user oN-Line System (or NLS), featuring original versions of modern computer-human interface elements including bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, and precursors to the <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> such as the computer mouse. As a pioneer of human-computer interaction, Engelbart is arguably SRI's most notable alumnus. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E

5|$|The browser was forked from Galeon, after developers' {{disagreements}} about Galeon's growing complexity. Since then Web {{has been}} developed {{as part of the}} GNOME project and uses most of GNOME's technology and settings when applicable. It is part of the GNOME Core Applications. As required by the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), Web maintains a clean and simple <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> with only a required minimum number of features exposed to users by default. The browser's functionality and configurability can be extended with official and third-party extensions.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{software}} developers {{are responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E

5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface.</b> He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{possible}} to access Xgrid from the command line, the Xgrid <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface,</b> a program bundled with Mac OS X Server and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all Mac OS X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of Mac OS X Server. This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with Mac OS X Server.|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E

First released in September 2008, the Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android operating system, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time, such as Symbian operating system, BlackBerry OS, and iOS. The operating system offers a customizable <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface,</b> integration with Google services such as Gmail, a notification system that shows a list of recent messages pushed from apps, and Android Market for downloading additional apps.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, SAS {{released}} {{a number of}} components to complement Base SAS. SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, {{as well as the}} SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and time series analysis. A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The Food and Drug Administration standardized on SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002. Vertical products like SAS Financial Management and SAS Human Capital Management (then called CFO Vision and HR Vision respectively) were also introduced. JMP was developed by SAS co-founder John Sall and a team of developers {{to take advantage of the}} <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> introduced in the 1984 Apple Macintosh and shipped for the first time in 1989. Updated versions of JMP were released continuously after 2002 with the most recent release being from 2016.|$|E
5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> {{currently used}} for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E

5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface,</b> including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
