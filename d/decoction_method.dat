40|$|Background/Aim. Data on {{phytochemical}} and pharmacological {{investigations of}} genus Cirsium Mill. (Asteraceae) are scarce. Some {{data suggest that}} decoctions or infusions prepared from these plants are used in folk medicine as tonics, particularly in inflammatory, liver and stomach diseases. So far {{there have been no}} pharmacological investigations related to Cirsium ligulare (C. ligulare) Boiss. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} estimate antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activities of aqueous extracts of C. ligulare herb prepared as 5 % and 10 % <b>decoctions.</b> <b>Methods.</b> Antioxidative activity was determined using the method of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging. Investigations of anti-inflammatory (a model of systemic inflammatory response induced by endotoxin of Escherichia coli and carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model for local inflammatory response), as well as gastroprotective effects (a model of stress-ulcer induced by absolute ethanol), were conducted in adult female Wistar rats that were given the aqueous extracts of C. ligulare herb per os. Indomethacin and ranitidine were used as reference drugs for evaluation of local anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective effects, respectively. Results. The results demonstrated that aqueous extracts of C. ligulare herb produced strong antioxidative activity, diminished body weight loss induced by endotoxin, significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema, and prevented the ulcerogenic action of absolute ethanol. Both anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activities of the extract tested were comparable to those of the reference drugs. Conclusion. Presented results justify the traditional use of C. ligulare herb decoctions and further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations are warranted.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the cytotoxicity, reduction in nitric oxide production and anti-oxidative {{activity of the}} aqueous leaf extract from Tithonia diversifolia (T.  diversifolia) in an in vitro model. Methods: Leaves of T.  diversifolia were collected from natural habitats and extracted with distilled water using the <b>decoction</b> <b>method.</b> The cytotoxic effect of the extract in terms of cell viability was determined using RAW 264. 7  cells and human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) via the mitochondrial respiration method using the MTT reagent. The effect of the extract on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264. 7  cells was measured using the Griess reagent. The chemical antioxidant was evaluated by ABTS- and DPPH-radical scavenging assays. Results: The half-maximal cytotoxic concentration values were 145. 87  μg/mL and 73. 67  μg/mL for human PBMCs and RAW 264. 7  cells, respectively. In the presence of phytohemagglutinin-M, the IC 50 on PBMCs proliferation was 4. 42  μg/mL. The non-cytotoxic range of the extracts inhibited LPS-induced nitrite production in RAW 264. 7 cells with an IC 50 value of 11. 63  μg/mL. To {{determine the}} anti-oxidative properties, the N-acetyl cysteine equivalent antioxidant capacity of the extract was (32. 62  ±  1. 87) and (20. 99  ±  2. 79) mg N-acetyl cysteine/g extract, respectively determined by the ABTS-radical and DPPH-radical assay. However, the extract did not confer death protection in a hydrogen peroxide-induced RAW 264. 7 co-culturing model. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the immunomodulation caused by the aqueous leaf extract of T.  diversifolia, resulting from the inhibition of phytohemagglutinin-M-induced PBMCs proliferation and LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264. 7 macrophages.

40|$|Siamese {{neem tree}} (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. var. siamensis Valeton) is a {{medicinal}} plant found in Thailand. Youngleaves and young flowers of this plant are commonly consumed as a bitter tonic vegetable. The flowers {{are also used}} fortreatment of fever. The flower extract {{has been reported to}} exhibit in vitro free radical scavenging activity and can inhibitlipid peroxidation of bronchogenic cancer cell line. Active compounds in the flowers are flavonoids such as rutin andquercetin. The content of these compounds in the crude extract depends on the method of extraction. Therefore, the appropriateextraction method promoting high yield of total flavonoids and high free radical scavenging activity was investigated inthis study. Six different extraction methods, i. e. maceration, percolation, decoction, soxhlet extraction, ultrasonic extraction(UE), and microwave assisted extraction (MA) were carried out for extracting dried powder of Siamese neem tree young flowers. The solvent used for maceration, percolation, and soxhlet extraction was 50 % ethanol, while distilled water was used for decoction and MA, and both solvents were used for UE. The content of crude extract, free radical scavenging activity, and total flavonoids content of each extract were investigated and compared. Comparing the various extraction <b>methods,</b> <b>decoction</b> provided an extract containing a high amount of total flavonoids (17. 54 mgRE/g extract) and promoting the highest scavenging activity at EC 50 11. 36 g/ml.

Rats in the Aristolochia fangchi group were orally administered with 8. 1 g/(kg·d) of Aristolochia fangchi and the normal control group was administered with equal volume of distilled water for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hour urine was collected at different time points (before, after 2 - and 4 -week administration and 2 weeks after administration) and their 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired and subjected to data process, including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) or orthogonal signal correction (OSC). The contents of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) and histopathological changes of the renal tissues were also detected. Results: The content of BUN of the Aristolochia fangchi group was markedly {{higher than that of}} the normal control group after 2 -week administration (P< 0. 05), and cellular edema in tubular endothelial cells, structure damage of glomeruli and inflammatory cell infiltration were found in the kidney. Along with the lasting of administration to 4 -week, the renal injury in the Aristolochia fangchi group became more serious, and the contents of BUN and SCr were all significantly higher as compared with the normal control group (P＜ 0. 05). Two weeks after administration, the content of BUN in the Aristolochia fangchi group was still higher than that in the normal control group (P＜ 0. 05), and the pathological changes in renal tissues were not different from those on the 4 th week. The urine of the Aristolochia fangchi group could be readily discriminated from the normal control group at every time point based on PCA. During the whole administration period, compared with the normal control group, the concentration of urinary taurine was increased time-dependently, while the citrate was decreased in the Aristolochia fangchi group. The concentration of hippurate was increased at the 2 nd week and the 6 th week (2 weeks after drug withdrawal) but decreased at the 4 th week; the concentration of creatinine/creatine was increased at the 4 th week but decreased at the 6 th week; the concentration of 2 -oxo-glutarate was decreased and the concentration of trimethylamine oxide was increased at the 4 th and 6 th week.
