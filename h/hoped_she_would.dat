5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E

A few months later, both King and Abernathy contacted her about coming to Montgomery, Alabama, to sing at a rally {{to raise money for the}} bus boycott. They also <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> inspire the people who were getting discouraged with the boycott.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{subjects}} Coleridge discusses in the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series, only Siddons and Richard Sheridan represent the theatre. The poem discusses many of Siddons's theatrical roles, including her performances in various plays by William Shakespeare. The poem also compares Coleridge's witnessing of the performances {{to a child}} hearing stories told to him. Coleridge's feelings towards Siddons continued to be favourable and he even wrote a play that he <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take a part. However, that play was not produced.|$|E

After her death, she waited in the Hall of Mirrors for Daniel, so that the two could advance to the afterlife together. With Daniel's own passing, the two were finally able to be together the way they could not be in life.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor's {{marriage}} in 1254 {{to the future}} Edward I of England {{was not the first}} marriage her family planned for her. The kings of Castile had long made a tenuous claim to be paramount lords of the Kingdom of Navarre in the Pyrenees, and from 1252 Ferdinand III's heir, Eleanor's half-brother Alfonso X of Castile, <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> marry Theobald II of Navarre. To avoid Castilian control, Margaret of Bourbon (mother and regent to Theobald II) in August 1253 allied with James I of Aragon instead, and as part of that treaty solemnly promised that Theobald would never marry Eleanor.|$|E

Although Amy was described as cute by Alex Huhtala of Computer and Video Games and the staff of Sega Saturn Magazine, Jem Roberts of the British Official Dreamcast Magazine called her a [...] "little-pink-dog-type-thing." ...|$|E

On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun.

500|$|Although Cindy Williams {{was cast}} as Laurie Henderson, the actress <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> get {{the part of}} Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark.

For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not have to cut his hair. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a stetson to cover his hair. Producer Francis Ford Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. [...] "George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public," [...] Jack reflected.

Oatman described the encounter as a meeting between friends.|$|E
500|$|Amy {{is a happy}} {{character}} with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in foster care it shows in her persona. Though it is often {{hard for people to}} understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and <b>hoped</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E
