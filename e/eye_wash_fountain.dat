5000|$|Plumbing {{fixtures}} are exchangeable devices using {{water that}} can be connected to a building's plumbing system. They {{are considered to be}} [...] "fixtures", in that they are semi-permanent parts of buildings, not usually owned or maintained separately.

50|$|The {{two women}} argue over whether Sally will move Robert against doctor's orders. Beth locks {{the three of}} them into the bedroom, which leads to a {{physical}} struggle over the key during which Sally breaks a mirror, inviting seven years bad luck. Beth threatens to burn Sally's face with acid, which leads to a stalemate. The three stay in the room until Robert's crisis is over. A doctor pronounces him healthy, but Robert refuses to go home with Sally. Sally throws the vial of acid on Beth's face only to discover that Beth was bluffing; the vial contained only <b>eye</b> <b>wash.</b>|$|R

The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an <b>eye</b> <b>wash,</b> since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|R
25|$|Although mayim acharonim {{was once}} not widely practiced (for example, until {{recently}} {{it did not}} appear in many Orthodox Passover Haggadahs) it has undergone something of a revival and has become more widely observed in recent years, particularly for special meals such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Conservative Judaism has supported discontinuing the practice of mayim acharonim {{on the grounds that}} the rabbis of the Talmud instituted it as a health measure, and since modern foods no longer contain preservatives so dangerous as to cause blindness upon contact with the <b>eyes,</b> <b>washing</b> the hands after meals is no longer required and can be discontinued by contemporary rabbinic decision.|$|R

"songs {{are small}} poems, {{thoughts}} or observations, some very short, and speak in straightforward, witty, and often surprisingly modern {{terms of the}} simple life they led - close to nature, their animals and to God. Some are literal translations and others, were translated (where existing translations seemed inadequate.) Robin Flower has written in The Irish Tradition: “It was not only that these scribes and anchorites lived by the destiny of their dedication {{in an environment of}} wood and sea; it was because they brought into that environment an <b>eye</b> <b>washed</b> miraculously clear by a continual spiritual exercise that they had that strange vision of natural things in an almost unnatural purity.” ...|$|R
50|$|Facial cleanliness: Children with grossly visible nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies {{on their}} faces are {{at least twice as}} likely to have active {{trachoma}} as children with clean faces.Intensive community-based health education programs to promote face-washing can significantly reduce the prevalence of active trachoma, especially intense trachoma (TI). If an individual is already infected washing one’s face is strongly encouraged, especially a child, in order to prevent re-infection. Some evidence exists that washing the face combined with topical tetracycline might be more effective in reducing severe trachoma compared to topical tetracycline alone. The same trial found no statistically significant benefit of <b>eye</b> <b>washing</b> alone or in combination with tetracycline eye drops in reducing follicular trachoma amongst children.|$|R

Boric acid is applied in a very dilute solution as an <b>eye</b> <b>wash.</b> Dilute boric acid {{can be used as}} a vaginal douche to treat bacterial vaginosis due to excessive alkalinity, as well as candidiasis due to non-albicans candida. As an antibacterial compound, boric acid can also be used as an acne treatment. It is also used as prevention of athlete's foot, by inserting powder in the socks or stockings, and in alcohol solution can be used to treat some kinds of [...] (ear infection) in both humans and animals.

60|$|Flannagan felt {{rather than}} saw that others were {{closing in on}} him, and then, {{fortunately}} for himself, he thought, he managed to draw his weapon. It was just as Billy was fading through the doorway into the room beyond. He saw the revolver gleam in the policeman's hand and then it became evident why Billy had clung so tenaciously to his schooner of beer. Left-handed and hurriedly he threw it; but even Flannagan must have been constrained {{to admit that it}} was a good shot. It struck the detective directly in the midst of his features, gave him a nasty cut on the cheek as it broke and filled his eyes full of beer--and beer never was intended as an <b>eye</b> <b>wash.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Prolonged {{contact with}} {{propylene}} glycol is essentially non-irritating to the skin. Undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed. Exposure to mists may cause eye irritation, {{as well as}} upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications. [...] However, limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals. It is therefore recommended that propylene glycol {{not be used in}} applications where inhalation exposure or human eye contact with the spray mists of these materials is likely, such as simulated fogs for theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for emergency <b>eye</b> <b>wash</b> stations.|$|R
25|$|The {{transition}} from an agricultural {{economy to a}} mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period since World War II has witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.

50|$|Böttcher America today {{manufactures}} {{and sells}} {{materials for the}} printing industry: printing rollers, printing blankets, and printing chemicals such as press <b>washes,</b> <b>fountain</b> solutions, and printing aids. These products {{can be used for}} a variety of markets (offset printing, rotogravure, flexography and digital printing).Böttcher America can supply rollers to customers as either “exchange” or “recover”. The “Roller Recover Program” allows customers to send Böttcher America used rollers to be recovered with new rubber. A customer can also order rollers through the “Exchange Roller Program” and a press-ready roller will be shipped. The customer is billed for the rubber only and has 60 days to return the core(s).Böttcher is the OEM roller supplier to the major sheet-fed press manufacturers including Heidelberg, MAN Roland, KBA, Komori and Mitsubishi.Böttcher America has won two awards for its products. In 1993, the company won a GATF award in recognition of the glaze free rollers technology (79 Series Rubber Compounds). In 2005, Böttcher America won a new PIA/GATF award for its Chameleon rubber roller compound which enables printers to switch freely among different inks (conventional, UV or hybrid) without changing printing rollers.|$|R

While agriculture continues to be the state's dominant industry, Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators, <b>washing</b> machines, <b>fountain</b> pens, farm implements, and food products that are shipped around the world.|$|R
6000|$|At this sink Hetty found a {{girl with}} heavy, gold-brown, artistic hair and plaintive <b>eyes,</b> <b>washing</b> two large [...] "Irish" [...] potatoes.

From a rose-pink kimono edged with Nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniature-painter living in a kind of attic--or [...] "studio," [...] as they prefer to call it--on the top floor. Hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was; but it certainly wasn't a house; because house-painters, although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street, are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home.|$|R
