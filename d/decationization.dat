40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of the nature of modifying acids (mineral, organic and heteropolyacids), and their combination on the composition and structure of the iron oxide rich clinoptilolit from Shankanay field in Kazakhstan for creation of selective catalysts in hydracarbon processing and sorbents for extracting ions of lanthanide and actinide elements. It is shown that sequential processing of natural zeolite in optimal conditions, by hydrochloric and sulfosalicylic acids lead to intensive <b>decationization</b> and dealumination, as well as maximum removal of iron ions from the zeolite framework without destroying it. It is found that the combination of activated clinoptilolite with hydrochloric acid and phosphotungstic heteropolyacid contributes to obtain catalyst system with high surface area and acidity...|$|E
40|$|Many polycation-based gene {{delivery}} vectors show high transfection in vitro, but their cationic nature generally leads to significant toxicity and poor in vivo performance which significantly hampers their clinical applicability. Unlike conventional polycation-based systems, decationized polyplexes {{are based on}} hydrophilic and neutral polymers. They are obtained by a 3 -step process: charge-driven condensation followed by disulfide crosslinking stabilization and finally polyplex <b>decationization.</b> They consist of a disulfide-crosslinked poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylamide) (pHPMA) core stably entrapping plasmid DNA (pDNA), surrounded by a shell of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). In the present paper the applicability of decationized polyplexes for systemic administration was evaluated. Cy 5 -labeled decationized polyplexes were evaluated for stability in plasma by fluorescence single particle tracking (fSPT), which technique showed stable size distribution for 48 h unlike its cationic counterpart. Upon the incubation of the polymers used {{for the formation of}} polyplexes with HUVEC cells, MTT assay showed excellent cytocompatibility of the neutral polymers. The safety was further demonstrated by a remarkable low teratogenicity and mortality activity of the polymers in a zebrafish assay, in great contrast with their cationic counterpart. Near infrared (NIR) dye-labeled polyplexes were evaluated for biodistribution and tumor accumulation by noninvasive optical imaging when administered systemically in tumor bearing mice. Decationized polyplexes exhibited an increased circulation time and higher tumor accumulation, when compared to their cationic precursors. Histology of tumors sections showed that decationized polyplexes induced reporter transgene expression in vivo. In conclusion, decationized polyplexes are a platform for safer polymeric vectors with improved biodistribution properties when systemically administere...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{therapy is}} {{considered}} a promising treatment for current intractable diseases. However, the clinical applicability of gene therapy is highly dependent {{on the development of}} safe and efficient gene delivery vectors. So far, viral vectors have been used for clinical applications, but due to severe risks associated with viruses, cationic polymers have been evaluated as alternatives to viral vectors. Cationic polymers can easily form nanosized particles with plasmid DNA (pDNA), named polyplexes, via electrostatic interactions and possess an enormous chemical and structural flexibility. Polycation-based vectors have demonstrated high efficiency in vitro, however, they induce severe toxicity and possess suboptimal efficiencies in vivo, mainly due to their cationic nature, which significantly hampers their clinical applicability. With our work we have developed an alternative to conventional polycation-based polyplexes: decationized polyplexes. Unlike the cationic polymer based systems, decationized polyplexes are formed by hydrophilic and neutral polymers and can be obtained by an innovative 3 -step process: polyplex formation by electrostatic interaction between pDNA and a polycationic precursor, structure stabilization by disulfide crosslinking, and finally removal of cationic charge - <b>decationization.</b> Structurally, decationized polyplexes consist of a disulfide-crosslinked poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylamide) (pHPMA) core stably entrapping plasmid DNA (pDNA), surrounded by a shell of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Retention of pDNA in the nanoparticles is exclusively based on physical entrapment given by the disulfide crosslinks, which provides an intracellularly triggered release profile, since disulfides are cleaved under the higher reducing environment present inside the cells. Through our study decationized polyplexes have demonstrated important advantages when compared to their cationic counterparts, such as much lower degree of nonspecific uptake and high degree cell specific uptake when decorated with targeting moieties as demonstrated by several cell uptake studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed lower cellular toxicity and in vivo nanotoxicity studies using a zebrafish model showed remarkable lower teratogenicity and mortality profile from decationized polyplexes. Stability evaluation in biological fluids a high stability for prolonged periods was found. Finally, in an in vivo biodistribution study, using tumor bearing mice, decationized polyplexes have shown greater retention in blood circulation and higher target tissue (tumor) accumulation. Given their important advantages, decationized polyplexes were also investigated and optimized for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery purposes, showing that decationized polyplexes {{can be used as a}} platform for different gene delivery modalities. In conclusion, decationzed polyplexes have demonstrated to be an important contribution for the development of safer polymeric gene delivery systems especially for targeted therapies. Importantly, the requirements for decationized polyplexes optimization have been identified, that will be the focus of future studies to further improve transfection efficiency and in vivo performance...|$|E
