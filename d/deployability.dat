[...] This worked against the vehicle; as weight increases, cost goes up and maneuverability goes down. The contractors worked to bring the weight down. The Army maintained that heavy armor was needed to protect the squad from acceleration forces that come with an underside blast, and that thicker underbelly plates and [...] V-shaped hulls do not give enough protection. [...] More armor would come from the vehicle being larger for more internal space for the soldiers, and to allow for features such as floating floors for blast deflection and extra headroom. [...] The Army also said heavy weight would not affect <b>deployability</b> because the Bradley it was planned replace already requires [...] strategic airlift transport aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|The Kiowa Warrior, {{sometimes}} referred to by its acronym KW, is the armed version of the OH-58D Kiowa. The main difference that distinguishes the Kiowa Warrior from the original AHIP aircraft is a universal weapons pylon found mounted {{on both sides of}} the aircraft. These pylons are capable of carrying combinations of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, air-to-air Stinger (ATAS) missiles, 7-shot 2.75 in (70 mm) Hydra-70 rocket pods, and an M296 [...]50 caliber machine gun. The standard of performance for aerial gunnery from an OH-58D is to achieve at least one hit out of 70 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle 800 to 1200 m away. The Kiowa Warrior upgrade also includes improvements in available power, navigation, communication and survivability, as well as modifications to improve the aircraft's <b>deployability.</b>|$|E
50|$|General Atomics {{revealed}} in April 2015 that its Gen 3 High Energy Laser (HEL) completed beam quality and power measurements tests. The Gen 3 laser {{has a number}} of upgrades that provide improved beam quality, increased electrical to optical efficiency, and reduced size and weight; the assembly is small at only 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.5 m, and is powered by a compact Lithium-ion battery to demonstrate <b>deployability</b> on tactical platforms. Beam quality remained constant through the 30-second demonstration, proving that the beam quality of electrically-pumped lasers can be maintained above 50 kilowatts. General Atomics plans to have the laser module deployable on their Avenger unmanned aerial vehicle by 2018.

5000|$|In {{a similar}} {{review of the}} second volume, Davis said that {{the first thing he}} noticed was the [...] "impressive credits list" [...] that the book contained. His first {{impression}} was that it was [...] "more of the same" [...] kind of material as the first edition. He was disappointed by the artwork, {{with the exception of the}} cover, saying that there was very little of it, and almost all of it came from old sources. However, Davis felt that the second volume was an improvement in many ways: [...] "The encounters look good for the most part, with none of the '876 Undead' excesses of BoL I. ... The encounters struck me as better planned and with more good ideas than many of those in BoL I. This may be a result of having so many contributors - even a creative genius can't possibly write 30-odd encounters, as Ward and Breault did, and make each a gem. There are more notes on lead-ins and setting up in this volume, which cuts down on the GM's preparation work without affecting the <b>deployability</b> of the encounters - the only thing you are constrained by is the terrain type." [...] Davis suggested that the volume was useful to anybody running campaigns below the tenth level, as well as those designing their own adventures.|$|E
5000|$|On June 29, 2017 Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler {{made the}} {{following}} statement after the House Armed Services Committee markup of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act:“The Obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from Members of Congress, is ill-conceived and contrary to our goals of increasing troop readiness and investing defense dollars into addressing budget shortfalls of the past. By recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. Surgeries alone could cost $1.35 {{billion over the next}} 10 years. For perspective, examples of other things the DoD could spend $1.35 billion on include 13 F-35's, 14 Super Hornet F-18’s, 2 B-21 long-range strike bombers, 8 KC-46's, all A-10 wing replacements or increased end strength of our troops.This policy is costly and a threat to our readiness. The <b>deployability</b> of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery. This recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation’s wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. It makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve. Transgendered individuals undergoing treatment are not eligible for special duties like flying status, personnel reliability program, and jobs requiring certain Security Clearances.This is also an issue of fairness.  Currently we refuse entrance into our armed forces for lesser physical issues, such as flat feet, bunions, asthma, and sleep walking. I had a constituent denied entrance into the JAG program because she had a bunion, yet accession standards are set to be modified to allow transgendered individuals into a military where they will be unable to fully serve. This is a senseless and highly unfair double standard.Military service is a privilege — not a right — predicated on the singular goal of fighting and winning our nation’s wars. All decisions on personnel and funding should be made with this in mind. High entry and retention standards are required because failure in the job costs lives. Last year's transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, 2 Combat Group {{combined}} with the Canadian Airborne Regiment to form the Special Service Force, a formation of the Canadian Army. This latter-day Special Service Force represented a compromise between the general-purpose combat capabilities of a normal brigade and the strategic and tactical flexibility that derived from the lighter and more mobile capabilities of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. The Force was a brigade-sized command with strength of 3,500, created to provide a small, highly mobile, general-purpose force that could be inserted quickly into any national or international theatre of operations. To this end each unit in the Force had a parachute sub-unit {{that would be used}} to support the Airborne Regiment. The 8th Canadian Hussars Armoured Regiment had 2 squadrons, [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B," [...] equipped with Cougar 6 wheeled armoured vehicles, and [...] "D" [...] Squadron, an armoured reconnaissance Squadron equipped with Lynx vehicles. In 1987, the 8th Canadian Hussars deployed to Canadian Forces Base Lahr in the former West Germany, while the Royal Canadian Dragoons replaced them in the Special Service Force at Petawawa after redeploying from Lahr. The 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, had a parachute battery (E Battery) with 105 mm L5 Pack Howitzers and 2 Combat Engineer Regiment provided an Airborne Engineer Troop. Command and supporting elements of SSF Headquarters and Signals were Airborne, as were a platoon provided from 2 Field Ambulance and a Tactical Air Movements Section from 2 Service Battalion. In keeping with the Total Force concept that evolved in the late 1980s a number of combat arms units of the Army Reserve were assigned operational taskings to provide subordinate units in order to augment the Special Service Force when required. These sub-units were trained and kept at a high state of readiness and were provided by units from the Central Militia Area (later re-designated as Land Forces Central Area and now known as the 4th Canadian Division). Including the Parachute Company of the Queen's Own Rifles, elements of the 2nd Field Engineer Regiment, and a composite battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery, among others. Though ultimately the Special Service Force's readiness and <b>deployability</b> were never tested as a formation, its units and soldiers served in operations both at home and around the world.
