500|$|In January 1969, Kennedy {{defeated}} Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin {{to become}} Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by {{the inevitability of}} having {{to run for the}} position; [...] "Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path", Time magazine reported, but [...] "he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect". The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, [...] "I know that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> ass shot off one day, and I don't want to." [...] Indeed, there were a constant series of death threats made against Kennedy for {{much of the rest of}} his career.|$|E
500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I think I have a few more fights left in me." ...|$|E

50|$|Cricket writer Samir Chopra later wrote:The {{names of}} the {{tourists}} that year were a mixture of the giggle-inducing and the dramatic. It was the autumn of 1979, and the last Packer-depleted Australia side to turn out for the ACB was in India. Those of us that greeted them that year knew little of what reluctant tourists they were, about how they felt cheated and betrayed by their overlords, and how they griped and belly-ached about their touring and playing conditions... All we knew was that Indian cricket was suspended in a bizarre netherworld, one where the world's best cricket players all seemed to be playing in a poorly attended circus in Australia, while second-stringers were sent to our shores. But I still thought the Packer players were mercenaries and still paid obeisance to nation-based cricket, so these players were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all <b>my</b> attention.|$|R

journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23

probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in
