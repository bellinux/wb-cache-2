5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, {{to eat and}} kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole.

Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer.

5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals.

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of artificial selection {{as they were}} useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort {{may have been too}} little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
