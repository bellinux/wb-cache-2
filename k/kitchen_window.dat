Some scenes {{included}} photography errors, including one in which light shines through a <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> from outside {{even though it is}} supposed to be nighttime. Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

60|$|I {{have many}} a time strolled sorrowfully along, with a sad heart {{and an empty}} stomach, about five o'clock, and looked wistfully down the areas in {{the west end of}} the town; and seen through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> the fires gleaming, and the joints of meat turning on the spits and {{dripping}} with gravy; and the cook maids beating up puddings, or trussing turkeys, and have felt for the moment that if I could but have the run of one of those kitchens, Apollo and the muses might have the hungry heights of Parnassus for me. Oh, sir! talk of meditations among the tombs--they are nothing so melancholy as the meditations of a poor devil without penny in pouch, along a line of <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> towards dinner-time.|$|R
50|$|Other bedrooms, as well {{as living}} rooms, dining rooms, and kitchens, are in a Western style. They usually have modern {{synthetic}} floor coverings.

25|$|The {{gun battle}} raging around 1395 Lakeview Road continued, however. Gunmen fired wildly in all {{directions}} from the upper floor windows. According to police, at one point a gunman {{stepped out of the}} house into the narrow passageway between 1395 and 1391 Lakeview, fired a few random shots, and went back inside. When he appeared at a <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> a few minutes later, police shot and apparently killed him (ending gunfire from {{the first floor of the}} structure).|$|E
25|$|Bob Clendenin as Tom Gazelian – Jules' widowed {{neighbor}} who expresses his attraction {{for her in}} weird ways, makes wine in his garage, and is always doing things for Jules and the gang without getting anything back {{in an attempt to}} become part of their group. He is frequently found to be peering into Jules' <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of in the kitchen with the others. His behaviour is often weird and creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{begins in}} 1992 with an elderly woman, Aliide Truu, {{who lives in}} a remote portion of Estonia. The woman had {{isolated}} herself from the surrounding society and watches the youth of her nation, including her daughter, leaving the countryside for the more urban regions and Finland. One day while looking out the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> she discovers Zara, the granddaughter of her sister Ingel. Zara had been forced to partake in the sex trade by the Russian Mafia but escaped them. The only guide she had to help her find help, was a photograph from her grandmother with Aliide's name on it. The story then continues with a series of flashbacks which develops the relationship of Aliide and her sister, which hinged upon their competition for the love of Hans Pekk during World War II. The story ends as Aliide begins to reconcile herself with her jealousy of her sister and Zara's redemption from her disenchantment with the world caused by her sexual subjugation.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{visitors}} fleeing through the courtyard were saved by the cook and manageress of the Hôtel du Palais, M.

[...] The identification of charred remains {{by the use of}} dental records was a landmark in the early history of forensic dentistry.|$|R
50|$|The design {{attempts}} to balance community life and personal privacy. The community layout and homes were designed {{with the concept}} of a privacy gradient, where privacy increases as one goes {{toward the back of the}} house. For example, sitting on one's front porch is an invitation to socialize, while sitting on the back porch does not. <b>Kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> are in the front of every house.|$|R
60|$|The {{important}} hour drew nigh. Christmas was to {{be passed}} by the Carabas family, the Beaconsfields, the Scropes, and the Clevelands at Lord Courtown's villa at Richmond; at which place, on account of its vicinity to the metropolis, the Viscount had determined {{to make out the}} holidays, notwithstanding the Thames entered his <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> and the Donna del Lago was acted in the theatre with real water, Cynthia Courtown performing Elena, paddling in a punt.|$|R
500|$|In the film, [...] "Helen Reed" [...] {{sees the}} {{attacker}} before being shot. However, Katie Starks was {{shot through the}} same window as her husband and did not see her attacker until he tried crawling through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> Mrs. Starks {{ran out of the}} house, but was not chased. At the end of the film, the officers chase the Phantom and shoot him in the leg, but the real Phantom was never chased or shot at all.|$|E
500|$|Black {{travels to}} Garry's {{home with a}} deputy, Kevin Reilly (Steve Bacic). Daubed in blood on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> are the numbers [...] "1 28 15", which Reilly notes {{no one has been}} able to understand. Black also listens to a {{recording}} of Garry's confession, which details the murders meticulously. Black convinces Garry's attorney to allow him an interview, insisting he will be entirely impartial. Garry tells Black he had planned the murders for some time, motivated by hatred for his wife and monetary concerns. Black refutes this, pointing out that Garry had carved a wooden angel as a gift for his wife that same day, using the chisel that was the murder weapon. Smith, realizing that Black does not believe Garry to be guilty, dismisses him from the case.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) [...] and Pam (Jenna Fischer) are {{attempting}} to get bargain deals on wedding plans from Andy (Ed Helms). When Pam turns down his ideas, Andy suspects that Pam might be acting controlling and cruelly to Jim, {{in the same way}} Angela (Angela Kinsey) treated Andy. Andy warns Jim, who tries to convince Andy that he and Pam are really happy. Andy remains convinced that Pam will betray him, so Jim asks Andy to provide for his emotional needs (as a prank). After Jim feigns crying on Andy's shoulder, Andy blames the office for Jim's emotional troubles and asks them to apologize. Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) tells Andy that Jim is just messing with him. Andy does not believe her until he sees Jim grinning through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> When Andy confronts Jim, Jim assures him that he and Pam are really happy and that Andy will find someone else one day.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to one of}} the largest populations of students anywhere on campus, James College is also home to several hundred ducks, geese, other assorted wildfowl, and rabbits. In the summer term, particularly, it is not unusual to find whole flocks of birds patrolling the quads and pecking at <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> or rabbits hopping past one's bedroom window. There have been occasions where ducks have been, accidentally, allowed to enter the houses and flats of James College.|$|R
60|$|Next day, about 3.40 P.M., a hansom drew up at {{the corner}} of Albany Grove. The fare alighted, and sauntered past Mr. Fulton's house. Rangoon, the Siamese puss, was sitting in a scornful and leonine attitude, in a tree of the garden above the railings, outside the open <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> whence came {{penetrating}} and hospitable smells of good fare. The stranger passed, and as he returned, dropped something here and there on the pavement. It was valerian, which no cat can resist.|$|R
5000|$|Reduced crime:Ted Hollamby {{insisted that}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> {{overlooked}} the pathways and avenues of the estate, and that front doors {{faced each other}} across the avenues. This is a far more effective anti crime measure than CCTV cameras, and prefigured the now ubiquitous [...] "Safer by Design" [...] strategies of urban architects and planners. In a multi-storey apartment block, unobserved corridors, walkways, and stairwells can create a high crime area. This was illustrated by the crime rate on the Broadwater Farm estate. However, regeneration, which eliminated the unobserved stairwells and walkways, transformed the estate into a low crime area.|$|R
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
500|$|In June 1974, Lennon and Pang {{returned}} {{to live in}} New York City. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool—while living at his aunt Mimi's house—he and Pang adopted two cats which they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album, the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street, where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23, 1974, from their terrace, which had {{a panoramic view of}} east New York. To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon's [...] "official" [...] photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, [...] "I’m not going to call up the newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night'". Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived.|$|E

60|$|They {{walked out}} under the trees to the brook-side and stood {{listening}} to the tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond. The light faded early on these September evenings, and the smoky mist had begun {{to rise from the}} water when they turned back again. The <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows</b> were already growing yellow, and through them the faithful Millicent could be seen bustling about in her preparations for supper. But Cynthia, having accomplished her errand, would not go in. She could not have borne to have any one drive back with her to Brampton then, and she must not be late upon the road.|$|R
2500|$|He painted three known color {{advertisements}} for General Electric's all-steel [...] "Monitor Top" [...] refrigerator in 1930. The {{first and most}} elaborate featured two boys running a lemonade stand, with their mother looking on through the open <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> It appeared as a full-page ad in many different magazines {{at roughly the same}} time. It's also shown in a video slideshow, which salutes the first affordable model for residential use (though at a hefty price). His other [...] "Monitor Top" [...] credits were of a girl playing with blocks (that spell out the company's initials), and two dressed-up girls listening to an enthusiastic sales boy.|$|E
2500|$|She invited groups not {{normally}} invited to presidential residences {{to visit her}} in Áras an Uachtaráin; from the Christian Brothers, a large religious order who ran schools throughout Ireland but had never had its leaders invited to the Áras, to G.L.E.N., the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the 14th Dalai Lama during his tour of Europe. She put a special symbolic light in her <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> in Áras an Uachtaráin which was visible {{to the public as}} it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish folk custom). Robinson's symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an Ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world. [...] She visited Rwanda where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war. After her visit, she spoke at a press conference, where she became visibly emotional. As a lawyer trained to be rational, she was furious at her emotion, but it moved many who saw it. One media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in 1990, journalist and Sunday Tribune editor Vincent Browne, passed her a note {{at the end of the}} press conference saying simply [...] "you were magnificent." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
60|$|I was fortunate, {{during my}} stay, in having {{experience}} of every variety of weather--from a dead calm {{to a regular}} gale. It was {{towards the end of}} my visit that the gale came on, and it lasted two days.

The spray rose above the <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> (70 feet on the tower), in such solid masses as to darken the room in passing, and twice during the storm we were struck by waves with such force as to shake the tower to its foundation.|$|R

I thought of the nearness of the laboratory to our <b>kitchen</b> <b>windows,</b> of the tremendous energy of the explosive with which the model-torpedo was charged, {{of the mass of}} combustibles of all kinds by which it was surrounded, of the thousand and one possibilities of the case, and of my own inexcusable madness in not being more careful.|$|R
