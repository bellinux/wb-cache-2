5000|$|The Expedition {{arrives on}} the planet Lantea (ATL-984) to find Atlantis still underwater. With power nearly exhausted, a {{failsafe}} releases the city and it rises to the surface. The episode [...] reveals that the expedition actually arrived at Atlantis twice, {{the first time in}} an alternate timeline. The first time, there was no failsafe and most of the personnel <b>drowned.</b> <b>Weir,</b> the only survivor, travels back 10,000 years in a puddle jumper she found fitted with a time machine. There, she changes the timeline by convincing the Ancient Janus to help her ensure the survival of the city and her people.|$|E
40|$|In aquatic systems, in-stream {{structures}} such as dams, weirs {{and road}} crossings can act as barriers to fish movement along waterways. There is a growing array of technological fish-pass solutions for the movement of fish across large {{structures such as}} weirs and dams. However, most existing weir structures lack dedicated fishways, and fish often {{have to rely on}} drowned conditions to move upstream. In order to assess the adequacy of a given or proposed weir for upstream fish passage under drowned conditions, it is necessary to determine, firstly, the hydraulic properties of the <b>drowned</b> <b>weir</b> with respect to the requirements of the fish community and, secondly, the duration and timing of drowning flows with respect to the hydrograph for the site and the likely timing of fish movements. This paper primarily addresses the first issue. A computer program has been developed and incorporated in a simple-to-operate spreadsheet for the determination of the hydraulic characteristics of a <b>drowned</b> <b>weir</b> which are important to fish movement. The program is based on a theoretical analysis of drowned weirs and subsequent extensive verification in laboratory experiments. Inputs to the program include site information comprising channel cross-section data, channel slope, and channel roughness, and weir information comprising weir height and the required minimum drowned depth over the weir for migrating fish passage. The program then calculates the flow rate at which the required level of drowning occurs, the velocity characteristics above the weir (including transverse distributions), and flow depths and velocities upstream and downstream of the weir. The paper discusses (briefly) the theoretical background of the program and its experimental verification. A case study is then presented that illustrates the use of the program in the field to assess fish passage opportunities at an existing weir and to develop a case for retrofitting a fishway. Some discussion is also provided on the contribution of a modelled drownout volume to the assessment of how significant a barrier a weir is to fish passage. It is shown that the program is an important new additional tool in the assessment of the adequacy of weir structures in providing for fish movement and informing associated fish passage solutions.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increase}} of diversity {{in the design of}} complex hydraulic structures. Thus {{there is a need to}} establish adequate mathematical models and software with complete description of processes. These models should be focused on certain classes of problems, which statements may change during the simulation. So, in our opinion, so-called self-organizing simulation models are perspective, they adapt to changes in the operating practice of the objects that require rapid adjustments in the boundary conditions and the field of simulation. Results of development of self-adapting complexes of numerical models, permitting calculation of complex water passageway systems with varying flow regime on separate parts (discharge; movement on the dry bottom, provided hydraulic head in free-flow downstream tunnel etc.). Presented system traces the movement of modeling area boundaries (when filling and dumping water passage sections) and chooses the appropriate boundary condition with changing flow regime on the border of modelling area of the flow (free-flowing weir – <b>drowned</b> <b>weir).</b> Given results of numerical simulation of real systems make it possible to consider proposed approach as efficient...|$|E
50|$|The main weir {{connects the}} second island to the {{opposite}} bank on the Kennington, Oxfordshire side. This is {{the location of the}} infamous Sandford Lasher, a treacherous weirpool where many have <b>drowned.</b> Another <b>weir</b> links the two lower islands.|$|R
5000|$|The pool {{below the}} weir, known as Sandford Lasher, has been notorious since the 19th century {{because of the}} number of {{individuals}} who have <b>drowned</b> there. <b>Weirs,</b> like the one at Sandford Lasher, generate powerful currents that can trap and hold a victim (and often attempted rescuers) underwater at the base of the structure; hence their reputation as [...] "drowning machines".|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{problems}} of using of measurement method Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to measure velocity {{fields in the}} flowing water in front, above and behind <b>drowned</b> titling <b>weir</b> gate. The aim was to obtain information about the distribution of speed {{in the area of}} interest for the verification or calibration of the numerical model. Experiments were carried out in inclinable channel connected to the hydraulic circuit with a pump and storage tank at the Water Management Research Laboratory (LVV) of Institute of Water Structures at the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Brno University of Technology. Hydraulic inclinable channel has cross-section with dimensions of 0. 4 × 0. 4 m and length of 12. 5 m. The measured area has cross-section approximately 0. 2 m wide and 0. 4 m high and its length is 1 m. The results of physical modelling allowed a comparison of experimental data with numerical simulation results of this type of flow in the commercial software ANSYS CFX- 12. 0...|$|R
50|$|Six {{months later}} the body is found but it is unrecognisable. Cornelius can not bear to {{officiate}} at the burial servoce and sends for Joshua to do it instead. Their sister comes to visit and tells them that {{on the night of}} her engagement she heard someone calling her name and wonders whether it {{had anything to do with}} the unfortunate man who had <b>drowned</b> in the <b>weir.</b> After she leaves Cornelius expresses that he wants to confess everything to her but Joshua talks him out of this. The two brothers do not then see each other for a long while but meet again at the Christening of Rosa's son. Afterwards they are drawn back to the weir where their father drowned. Cornelius muses that he often thinks of suicide and Joshua replies that this thought has come to his mind also.|$|R
5000|$|Some critics—notably D. H. Lawrence—see {{the novel}} as {{a study of the}} way {{communities}} control their [...] In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitable bride for her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be a witch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia's supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her in effigy. Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time—by <b>drowning</b> in the <b>weir</b> like any woman instead of floating, witchlike—she proves her essential innocence to the community.|$|R
50|$|Following his {{dismissal}} from a draper's shop, {{where his}} father had placed him as an apprentice, protagonist Alfred Polly (John Mills) {{finds it hard to}} find another position. When a telegram arrives informing him of his father's death, he returns to the family home. With a bequest of £500, Polly starts to consider his future; and a friend of his father's, Mr Johnsen (Edward Chapman), urges him to invest it in a shop - an idea that Polly hates. Whilst dawdling in the country on a newly-bought bicycle, Polly has a brief dalliance with a schoolgirl, Christabel (Sally Ann Howes); but later marries a cousin, Miriam Larkins (Betty Ann Davies). Fifteen years later, Polly and his wife are running a drapery in Fishbourne, and the marriage has descended to incessant arguments and bickering. While walking in the country, Polly decides to commit suicide but he also sets his shop ablaze {{in the hope that the}} insurance will assure Miriam's prosperity; he botches the arson job and, instead of killing himself, rescues an elderly neighbour and becomes a minor local celebrity. Still unhappy, Polly leaves Miriam and is hired by a rural innkeeper (Megs Jenkins) as handyman and ferryman; however, he soon realises that the position was open because the innkeeper's brother-in-law Jim (Finlay Currie) is a drunkard who chases any other man away from the inn. Polly clashes with Jim until the latter accidentally <b>drowns</b> in a <b>weir</b> when he is chasing Polly. Several years later, Polly returns to Fishbourne to find Miriam operating a tea-shop with her sister, in the belief that Polly has drowned, and he returns to his happier life at the inn.|$|R
