500|$|The {{game was}} first {{shown to the}} public at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2005 in a short pre-rendered trailer. It was later {{announced}} during Nintendo's press conference at the E3 2006. Nintendo revealed in May 2006 that Corruption would be released as a launch title for the Wii console, but a few months later it was delayed to 2007. In April 2007, Fils-Aimé stated in an interview that Corruption was [...] "not going to ship by June" [...] and set it at a summer 2007 release date at the earliest. Later he opined, [...] "when we release it, it will be perfect. And if that's a little later than <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> have liked, I'm hoping they're going to be happy." [...] In late April 2007, IGN editor Matt Casamassina revealed that Corruption would be shown in detail during May of that year, and that the game would be released on August 20, 2007, in the United States. Nintendo of America later announced to have moved the release date to August 27, 2007, but Nintendo finally announced an [...] "in stores" [...] date of August 28, 2007. The game was later released in Europe on October 26, 2007, and in Japan on March 6, 2008. In the Japanese version, the game's difficulty level is decided by answering to [...] "a questionnaire from the Galactic Federation", in contrast to the North American version where the difficulty level is chosen directly by the player. Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe said that an idea for a questionnaire came from Retro Studios.|$|E
2500|$|Falwell {{condemned}} homosexuality as {{forbidden by}} the Bible. Gay rights groups called Falwell an [...] "agent of intolerance" [...] and [...] "the {{founder of the}} anti-gay industry" [...] for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant's 1977 [...] "Save Our Children" [...] campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the repeal of the ordinance, Falwell told one crowd, [...] "Gay <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> just as soon kill you as look at you." [...] When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them [...] "brute beasts" [...] and stated, [...] "this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there'll be a celebration in heaven." [...] He later denied this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, [...] "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals." [...] Amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a Teletubby being a homosexual role model for homosexual recruitment and stating that LGBT organizations angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the September 11 attacks happen.|$|E
6000|$|Kennicott {{considered}} it, and mumbled to Calibree, [...] "Think you <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> like to {{stop and}} try {{a ride on the}} merry-go-round?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1993 {{would be}} Ryan's next Brier appearance. This time Ryan {{had moved from}} Edmonton, Alberta to Kelowna, British Columbia. In 1993, Ryan played third for Rick Folk which lost the final to Russ Howard from Ontario. Ryan and <b>Folk</b> <b>would</b> return to the 1994 Labatt Brier where they won, getting their revenge against Howard in the final. At the 1994 World Championships, Ryan would win his second World Championships, as their team {{defeated}} Jan-Olov Nässén of Sweden in the final. Ryan and <b>Folk</b> <b>would</b> return to the Brier again in 1995, however they finished 6-5.|$|R
5000|$|In certain myths, {{the moss}} <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> ask humans for breast milk {{to feed their}} young, [...] or steal little human {{children}} [...] - motifs found in changeling lore.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'd obey fast enough, if <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> {{only speak}} like you do--not drive one about like a dog, when one knows one {{is every bit}} as good as they.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can find}} lots of pretty Christmas greens out there," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to the door; [...] "perhaps your <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> like to have some." ...|$|E
60|$|Farms {{were rather}} {{scattered}} in that neighborhood, but occasionally they passed country homes, {{when all the}} <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> rush forth to learn what the drumming and fifing meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a conundrum," [...] {{returned}} Andy. [...] "But I {{have heard}} it said that many city-born <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> rather die between brick walls than live amid green fields." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{three and}} a loaf. I wish these fine <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> stay at home till they're asked; and I want to finish {{trimming}} my hat" [...] (bonnet she meant).|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Henchard's rejoicings couldn't {{say good}} morning to this," [...] said one. [...] "A man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> go up to that bleak place to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now it was}} {{the thought}} of what <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> say when they heard that Adam Lambert had disappeared, and was, of a truth, not {{returning}} home, which kept Sir Marmaduke still lingering in England.|$|R
60|$|Their tongues {{a little}} {{loosened}} by the punch, the old <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> have sung his praises to {{the verge of}} tediousness had he not almost sternly interrupted them.|$|E
6000|$|Grant smiled very gravely. [...] "I {{think you}} had better take mine. If they found a lady's {{handkerchief}} round my head, Allonby's <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> wonder how it got there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, he's a sight fer sore eyes. First time anybody {{sees him}} they either laughs er chokes. The movin'-pictur' <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> go crazy over him. Ever seen a movin'-pictur'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Civilized <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> have {{no use for}} him afterwards," [...] Harding broke in. [...] "We want sane, normal men on this continent. Neurotics, hoodoos and fakirs {{are worse}} than a plague; there's {{contagion}} in their fooling." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Sign of the Four, Small wonders [...] "how my <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> stare {{when they}} saw their ne'er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores" [...] when {{justifying}} his decision to help end Achmet's life for the treasure he carried.|$|R
6000|$|Suppose, when now {{the house}} is dumb, When lights are out, and ashes fall - Suppose their ancient owners come To claim our spoils of shop and stall, Ah me! within the narrow hall How strange a mob would meet and go, What famous <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> haunt them all, Octavo, quarto, folio! ...|$|R
60|$|And {{when they}} reached St. Albans, there would be that wretched couple, kissing under the Abbey walls. Then these <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> go and be pirates until the {{marriage}} was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious, what a mix-up!" [...] exclaimed Johnny Chuck. [...] "With Chippy {{being called}} a Tree Sparrow and a Tree Sparrow called Chippy, I should think <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> get all tangled up." ...|$|E
60|$|Patience {{was rather}} startled by seeing him laboriously tying up a posy of wild rose, honeysuckle, and forget-me-not, {{and told him}} the Bristol <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> not buy those common wild flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye are a grand lady, but hard, I think, as some <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> call ye bonny. I am a poor sewing {{woman with}} the need to strive hard, an' always, to keep hunger from the door--but in the hearts of us there is no that {{difference}} between you an' me. No--bide ye and listen." ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{an ancient}} Kupala belief that the eve of Ivan Kupala {{is the only time}} of the year when ferns bloom.

6000|$|How {{soon would}} the watches find the body? Having found it, {{what would they}} do?

6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} never will be. Everybody thinks Sam is lying, {{and if we}} should tell of the coal we {{discovered}} the <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> say for sure he stole the money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "he {{was across the}} {{frontier}} by that time, and I don't know that most <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> have done it, if they'd had the warning the boys sent me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And your {{sick people}} in the meantime?'Puck demanded. 'We persuaded them {{on the north side}} of the street to lie out in Hitheram's field. Where the plague had taken one, or at most two, in a house, <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> not shift for fear of thieves in their absence. They cast away their lives to die among their goods.' ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} or two she stood quite still, her senses {{strained}} to grasp the meaning, the purport of the present situation--this madman on the watch outside--the young Count, key in hand, swaggering up to the back door at ten o'clock, when most <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> be at supper in the barn, her father gone, the village street wrapped in darkness! ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{the music}} of tom-tom and chac-chac, the {{coloured}} <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> dance perpetually till ten o'clock, after which time the rites of Mylitta are silenced by the policeman, {{for the sake of}} quiet folk in bed.

6000|$|When she was gone, Mrs. Lander asked, [...] "What do you s'pose your <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> {{say to your}} goin' to Europe, anyway, Clementina?" [...] as if {{the matter}} had been already debated between them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack. My <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> give a {{good deal}} to smooth the whole matter over. But, instead of {{becoming}} reconciled to the situation, old Uncle Barney apparently is becoming more bitter as time goes by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose you're giving Shanks {{his chance}} of making good. The trouble is, he's forced to take the chance, whether he wants or not. Some <b>folks</b> <b>would</b> sooner live like dogs than decent citizens." ...|$|E
6000|$|...

2500|$|Jones {{was first}} {{teamed up with}} {{experienced}} producer and engineer Jay Newland. Bacchus thought that Newland's experience in jazz, blues, rock, country and <b>folk</b> <b>would</b> give him a [...] "feeling for her sound." [...] Together they cut around nine demo tracks, of which six formed her debut Blue Note release, the sampler First Sessions, while the rest were set aside for her debut album. First Sessions was released in 2001.|$|R
