25|$|None of {{the lines}} {{constructed}} ever made a profit. Freight rates were the same for broad and narrow-gauge railways, despite higher direct costs. Most of the loadings were goods such as timber, potatoes and lime, which were charged at a low rate. Most freight was outbound, so many trains travelled towards the terminals almost empty. And despite originating the traffic, the lines were only credited with {{a portion of the}} <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> The amount credited to the lines did not cover the cost of running trains, and the more traffic the larger the loss. However, particularly in the 1920s, the traffic generated by the narrow-gauge lines was appreciated by the railways and the lines survived for up to 60 years before closure.|$|E

50|$|International freight forwarders, NVOCCs {{and customs}} brokers often charge for {{transferring}} documents to another transportation company at destination. This fee {{is a part}} of the ocean <b>freight</b> <b>charges,</b> being paid by the importer at the port of discharge in the International Commercial Term (incoterm) FOB (free on board), and by the exporter at the origin in the incoterms CFR (cost and freight) and CIF (cost, insurance and freight). This fee is separate from documentation fees charged by carriers and NVOCCs as part of the <b>freight</b> <b>charges</b> on a bill of lading and is separate from other fees for document preparation or for release of cargo. Some companies call this an administration fee, document fee, document transfer fee, but it exists in some form in most destinations and is well known to most shippers. Steamship carriers do not have this fee.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} {{advantage of the}} project {{is that it will}} eliminate transshipment costs at import and export ports, as well as the long road journeys to reach these ports, thereby offering significant cost savings in the overall <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> Barges can be loaded directly close to the point of manufacture, and discharged within a couple of hundred kilometres of the final point of delivery. Transport cost savings are estimated at more than US$1,000 per FEU (forty-foot equivalent container).|$|E

50|$|LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh {{was created}} in 2015 after LAUGFS Gas {{acquired}} a controlling stake Petredec Elpiji in Bangladesh and was fully consolidated in 2016. It has a LPG import, bottling and distribution facility in Mongla Port with a storage capacity of 1800MT which is being expanded to 2200MT and satellite filling stations {{in different parts of}} Bangladesh are being built. LAUGFS Gas hopes to invest around $120 million in Bangladesh during the first four years and since LAUGFS gas's entry to the Bangladesh market <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> for LPG has been reduced from 170-200 USD per tonne to 110-100 USD per tonne.|$|E
50|$|The {{currency}} adjustment factor (CAF) is a fee placed on top of <b>freighting</b> <b>charges</b> for carrier companies. The charge was developed to account for constantly changing exchange rates between the dollar and other currencies. Thus its goal is to offset any losses from constantly fluctuating exchange rates for carriers.Calculation basis & methodology might vary from carrier to carrier.|$|R

On New Year’s Day, 1870, Mansfield hosted an open house. Fisk invited Stokes to join him at the party and there introduced him to Mansfield. Stokes became a frequent visitor to Mansfield’s home.|$|R
50|$|Blankenbuhler {{replaced}} the Shay locomotives with 40-passenger gasoline-powered railcars for the 1916 season. Some {{of the last}} freight hauled over the 9-miles from Silver Plume to Waldorf was 100,000 pounds (50 tons) of telephone poles, wire, insulators and supplies for Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph {{in the summer of}} 1917. This was for the Argentine Pass segment of a long-distance telephone line from Denver to Leadville. Because the railroad was exclusively a tourist line at this time, all freight had to be hauled at night or early in the morning. The <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> for this load of telephone supplies was $500, or $1.11 per ton-mile. In contrast, the average freight rate in the United States in 1915 was under $0.008 per ton-mile.|$|E
50|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed in}} Dunedin early in 1881 {{but it was not}} until New Zealand Shipping Company's steamer S S Mataura arrived over twelve months later that New Zealand Refrigerating Company directors: John Roberts, Edwin Spence and Alexander Begg took responsibility for overseeing the loading of freshly killed stock owned by runholders for freezing on board ship. As well as the 3,844 sheep, 6 bullocks and 77 sucking pigs the Mataura carried: hares, rabbits, fowls, ducks, barracudas, hapuka, pukeko, frost fish, cheeses, hams and a cask of penguin skins. The New Zealand Refrigerating Company made a tiny profit but the shipping company's costs of the voyage exceeded their <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> The shippers on their own account were pleased with results but the overfat sheep were unsaleable.|$|E

25|$|Certain of Hardrick's {{works are}} lost, {{including}} Lady X and murals painted for a WPA commission for local Indianapolis schools. The {{story of the}} loss of Lady X reveals the strained finances of Hardrick in 1933. The Harmon Foundation had been exhibiting the piece and returned it to Hardrick via Railway Express. The artist was unable to pay the <b>freight</b> <b>charges</b> to retrieve the work, and records of its present location are unavailable.|$|R
25|$|Passengers {{headed up}} river would {{disembark}} {{at the lower}} Cascades, travel on the portage road along the north bank, and then board the sidewheeler Mary upriver to the next head of navigation, The Dalles. <b>Freight</b> <b>charges</b> were high, $50 a ton on cargo from Portland to The Dalles, but Belle and Mary still could not handle the demand, and other steamers came on the routes, driving rates down to $30 a ton.|$|R
50|$|Patrons eating just dessert paid 35 {{cents for}} a piece of cake or a slice of pie, another nickel would buy you the house specialty. Although it sounds like steal by today's standards, the Lodge was not {{considered}} cheap eats at the time. It was a special occasion to eat out and many families made a ritual of going to the Lodge for Sunday lunch after church. Due to the remote location, many food items required a <b>freight</b> <b>charge.</b> As many ingredients as possible were locally sourced. The rich cream used in the banana cream pies came from the Matanuska Maid dairy co-op just down the road, but items like bananas had to be transported all the way from Seattle.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the cash salaries paid by the Casa da Índia, captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and {{a certain number of}} boxes of assorted goods (caixas forras de fretes e direitos, or caixas de liberdades, [...] "liberty chests"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships free of <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit. Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' × 3' × 2.5' ...|$|E
50|$|All {{technology}} uses {{energy to}} transform the material into a desirable object or uses some form of mechanics combined with another form to make something better. The cheaper energy is, the wider the class of technologies that are considered economic. This is why technological history {{can be seen as}} a succession of ages defined by energy type i.e. human, animal, water, peat, coal, and oil. The Romans used water power, and watermills were common throughout the Empire, especially to the end of the 1st century AD. They were used for cereals milling, sawing timber and crushing ore. They exploited wood and coal for heating. There were huge reserves of wood, peat and coal in the Roman Empire, but they were all in the wrong place. Wood could be floated down rivers to the major urban centres but otherwise it was a very poor fuel, being heavy for its caloric value. If this was improved by being processed into charcoal, it was bulky. Nor was wood ever available in any concentration. Diocletian's Price Edict can give us a glimpse of the economics of transporting wood. The maximum price of a wagon load of 1,200 lbs of wood was 150 d.(denari). The maximum <b>freight</b> <b>charge</b> per mile for the same wagon load was 20 d. per mile. Room heating was normally better done by charcoal braziers than hypocausts. But hypocausts did allow them to exploit any poor-quality smoky fuels like straw, vine prunings and small wood locally available. Hypocausts also allowed them to generate a humid heat for their baths.|$|E

50|$|Maritime {{transport}} is watercraft carrying people (passengers) or goods (cargo). Freight transport {{has been}} achieved widely by sea throughout recorded history. Although the importance of sea travel for passengers has decreased due to aviation, it is effective for short trips and pleasure cruises.
