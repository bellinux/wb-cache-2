5|$|By 1994, Copeland's {{mother had}} {{separated}} from Robert. After living with various friends and boyfriends, DelaCerna moved {{with all of}} her children into two small rooms at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, California. In early 1996, Cantine convinced Copeland to attend a ballet class at her local Boys & Girls Club. Cynthia Bradley, a friend of Cantine's, taught a free ballet class at the club once a week. Copeland attended several classes as a spectator before participating. DelaCerna allowed Copeland {{to go to the}} club after school until the workday ended. Bradley invited Copeland to attend class at her small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. Copeland initially declined the offer, however, because her mother did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car,</b> was working 12–14 hours a day, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E

25|$|Ngata {{acted as}} a major force behind the revival of arts such as kapa haka and carving. He also enacted a {{programme}} of land development, which helped many iwi retain and develop their land. Ngata became very close to Te Puea, the Waikato kingite leader, who {{was supported by the}} government in her attempt to improve living conditions for Waikato. Ngata transferred four blocks of land to Te Puea and her husband and arranged extensive government grants and loans. Ngata sacked the pakeha farm development officer and replaced him with Te Puea. He arranged for her to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> to travel around the various farms. Te Puea's husband was also given a large farm at Tikitere near Rotorua. The public, media and parliament became alarmed at the flow of funds from government to Te Puea during the recession. A Royal Commission was held in 1934 that found Ngata guilty of maladministration and misappropriation of funds to the value of 500,000 pounds. Ngata was forced to resign.|$|E
25|$|Michael Waltrip {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Bill Davis Racing in 2006 as Davis was going to switch to Toyota in 2007, which was the selected manufacturer for Waltrip's new team as well. This enabled Waltrip to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> to drive as he built his team. NAPA Auto Parts, Waltrip's sponsor, followed him to his new team and Waltrip ran a Dodge Charger for 2006. The team bought points from Penske Racing's No. 77 team, which shut down after it lost sponsorship. Since the listed owner of the No. 77 was Doug Bawel, whose Jasper Motorsports team was absorbed by Penske a few years earlier, his name was registered as owner and the No. 55 ran under the Waltrip-Jasper Racing banner for 2006. The arrangement called for the points {{to be transferred to}} Waltrip's new ride at MWR for 2007, which they were, however Waltrip failed to make the top-35 in points, which meant Waltrip would have to qualify on time in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Kings {{bought an}} acre of land on a bare {{hillside}} at Warrandyte, a small settlement in the Yarra valley, about 25km north-east of Melbourne. In the early 1950s, it was a rural area, rather isolated, and lacking most of the services now taken for granted in suburban areas (such as roads, water, sewerage and electricity). The Kings asked the architect, Robin Boyd (cousin of the artist, Arthur Boyd), to design a house for them. Boyd designed a basic, one-roomed house, which could be extended in modules over time. They did much of the building work themselves. They moved into the house at Christmas, 1952. They had no electricity {{for the first six}} months and no hot-water system for three years and the house had tanks for water. They did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> for a couple of years. During this time, the Kings’ two daughters, Joanna and Angela, were born. King later referred to their lifestyle at this time as ‘suburban pioneering’, though such pioneering was not uncommon in the outer suburbs of Melbourne at this time.|$|E

25|$|As a teenager, Ian argues {{with his}} father Pete Beale (Peter Dean) over his desire to become a caterer but his {{grandmother}} Lou Beale (Anna Wing) encourages him. He starts several businesses and buys a local café soon after graduating from catering college. Ian has several failed romances, including with his childhood friend, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), with whom Ian remains close, fellow student, Tina Hopkins (Eleanor Rhodes) and his cousin, Elizabeth Beale (Lucy Bayler). Ian gets engaged to Cindy Williams (Michelle Collins) in 1989; however, a one-night stand with her former lover Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) leaves her pregnant. Cindy marries Ian and claims that the baby she is expecting, Steven Beale, is his, resulting in Ian attempting suicide when he learns the truth. He recovers and causes Simon to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> accident in revenge so Simon, Cindy and Steven leave Walford together. Ian immerses himself in his catering business but his exploitative working practices alienate his friends, employees and family. He and Cindy later reconcile and Ian is overjoyed to become a father to twins, Peter Beale and Lucy Beale. After opening a fish and chip shop, Ian becomes so obsessed with building his business empire that he neglects Cindy, who decides to leave him for his half-brother, David Wicks (Michael French). Ian wins custody of their children, and makes Cindy so miserable that she hires John Valecue (Steve Weston), a hitman to kill him. Ian is shot but is only clipped by the bullet and recovers. Cindy leaves the country with Steven and Peter and spends a year in Italy before Ian traces them and retrieves the boys. Cindy returns to Walford and wins back {{custody of the children}} but is implicated in Ian's shooting. She is jailed on remand and dies several months later in prison during childbirth.|$|E

Although he impresses Zelda, Homer and Marge think she is a [...] "hoochie" [...] and only likes Grampa because he can drive. After he crashes Homer's car in a drag race with a rival seniors gang, Homer gets particularly livid with Grampa and takes his keys away, forbidding him to drive ever again.

500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{direction}} of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically {{a shift from}} the production focus to market focus. [...] The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s {{was to create a}} product of high technical quality. If you created a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the production orientation.

2500|$|By 1918, {{half of all}} cars in America were Model T's. All {{new cars}} were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Any {{customer}} can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> painted any color that he wants {{so long as it}} is black". Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).|$|E

The training for B class licence requires 18 hours of instructed driving, including a spell on a slippery driving course, and 19 theory lessons. After this, the person must pass a computerized theory test and a driving test in city traffic with a minimum length of 30 minutes. C class training is similar, but longer.|$|E
