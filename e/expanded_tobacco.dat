40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{recent trends}} in smoking {{initiation}} by adolescents with trends in inflation-adjusted cigarette pricing and tobacco marketing expenditures. DESIGN: We examined smoking initiation trends in demographic subgroups of adolescents aged 14 - 17 years {{during the decade}} 1979 - 1989. Data on cigarette pricing and tobacco marketing expenditures were adjusted for inflation and plotted over this same period. SETTING: Large population surveys, United States. SUBJECTS: 140, 975 ever-smokers aged 17 - 38 when surveyed in 1992 or 1993, who reported on age of smoking initiation during the decade 1979 - 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Initiation rate was calculated as the number in an age group who reported starting to smoke regularly in a year, divided {{by the number of}} never-smokers {{at the start of the}} year. Trends were evaluated by linear and quadratic models. RESULTS: From 1979 to 1984, adolescent initiation rates decreased, but increased thereafter, particularly among males, whites, and those who, as adults, reported never having graduated from high school. Cigarette price increased throughout the decade as did tobacco marketing expenditures, especially for coupons, value-added items, and promotional allowances. CONCLUSION: Availability of cheaper cigarettes is not likely to be a cause of increased smoking initiation by adolescents. Although other influences cannot be ruled out, we suspect that the <b>expanded</b> <b>tobacco</b> marketing budget, with its increased emphasis on tactics that may be particularly pertinent to young people, affected adolescent initiation rates. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of tobacco smoke {{research}} from the early 1950 s to the mid- 1960 s it was repeatedly asserted that a) tobacco and many tobacco components {{were involved in the}} pyrogenesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), several of which were reported to initiate tumors on the skin of laboratory animals and b) tobacco additives (flavorants, casing materials, humectants) were highly likely to be similarly involved in PAH pyrogenesis. Extensive knowledge on PAHs was deemed highly necessary because of their claimed importance in the smoking-health issue. The numerous assertions about the generation of PAHs in cigarette mainstream smoke (MSS) triggered extensive and intensive research both within and outside the Tobacco Industry to define the nature of the PAHs, their per cigarette MSS delivery amounts, their precursors, etc. It was not until 1960 that VAN DUUREN et al. (1) reported three specific aza-arenes in cigarette MSS that were asserted to be involved in smokers’ respiratory tract cancer. As noted in a recent Letter to the Editors (2), the presence of these three aza-arenes in tobacco smoke has never been confirmed. Between 1960 and 1965, other MSS components (phenols as promoters, polonium- 210, N-nitrosamines, ciliastatic compounds) were asserted to be responsible for smoking related diseases. However, no major assertions were made that phenols, polonium- 210, or the N-nitrosamines were derived from flavorants, casing materials, or humectants. Some investigators did report that several ciliastats were derived from added sugars and glycerol. The ciliastat proposal was drastically diminished in importance by the findings in the 1960 s that only a relatively small proportion of the ciliastats reached the smoker's cilia. During that time, pertinent skills and competencies in research on tobacco smoke composition, particularly the PAH fraction, have been developed. Such skills permitted the isolation in crystalline form of 14 PAHs and the quantitation of these and many other PAHs. They were also used to put in perspective the pyrogenesis of PAHs from a) specific tobacco components, b) additives, and c) processed tobaccos (reconstituted tobacco sheet [RTS], <b>expanded</b> <b>tobacco).</b> R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJRT) pioneered the use of RTS (1953) and expanded tobaccos (1969) in cigarette blends and generated much previously unpublished data on the effect of such processed tobaccos on MSS composition...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY From 1997 - 2006 {{the tobacco}} {{industry}} and tobacco trade organizations contributed $ 464, 700 to Ohio state political candidates and political parties, including $ 88, 400 during the 2005 - 6 election. From 1997 - 2006 {{the tobacco industry}} and tobacco trade organizations made 77. 2 % of their total contributions to individuals and organizations affiliated with the Republican Party. Starting in 2000, health advocates made attempts to introduce clean indoor air regulations to all public and work places in Lucas County through the regulatory authority of the County Board of Health. These attempts were opposed by forces allied with the tobacco industry, and included legal and legislative challenges. In 2002 the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Boards of Health {{do not have the}} authority to regulate tobacco products. In 1998, the state settled its lawsuit against the tobacco industry through the Master Settlement Agreement, which awarded the state about $ 350 million per year. In 1999, Governor Bob Taft (R) formed the Tobacco Task Force to outline a plan for how Ohio would use the Master Settlement Agreement money awarded to the State. This plan specified the formation of the Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation to coordinate Ohio’s tobacco control programs {{and the creation of a}} trust fund/endowment to fund the Foundation with $ 1. 1 billion in MSA revenue by 2008. Through 2008 the Ohio Legislature has redirected the majority of the Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation’s funding to the State’s general fund. The Foundation has received only 32 % of the originally planned funding recommended by the Tobacco Task Force. From 1997 - 2006, Ohio has increased the State’s excise tax on cigarettes twice. In 2002 the tax was increased $. 21 to a total of $. 55 and in 2005 the tax was increased $. 70 to a total of $ 1. 25. None of these funds were directed to Ohio’s tobacco control programs. The Ohio Department of Health has a very small and limited Tobacco Risk Reduction Program that is completely funded by grants from the US Centers for Disease Control that has historically ranged between $ 1 - 2 million. The Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation is a government funded independent foundation that is charged with running and coordinating all of Ohio’s tobacco control programs. Due to the redirection of originally planned funding, the Foundation’s annual budgets have leveled off at $ 45 million, short of the CDC recommended minimum $ 62 million in annual tobacco control program expenditures for Ohio. In order to maintain even this reduced level of activity, the Foundation has had to start spending down its principle. Absent a new infusion of funds, it will be forced to cease operations in 2016. The Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation’s community grants program effort has <b>expanded</b> <b>tobacco</b> control infrastructure throughout the state and accelerated the pursuit of local clean indoor air efforts throughout Ohio. Local efforts to pass comprehensive clean indoor air ordinances in Ohio produced variable results with some tobacco control successes, such as in Columbus, and some setbacks, such as in Toledo. In 2005, the American Cancer Society and a coalition of Ohio health groups formed Smoke Free Ohio, a campaign to pursue a statewide comprehensive clean indoor air law through a ballot initiative. The campaign was run primarily by the American Cancer Society and received some criticism from tobacco control advocates for being too hierarchical and insulated. In response to the Smoke Free Ohio campaign, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company backed a competing campaign called Smoke Less Ohio, which was a ballot initiative to amend the State’s constitution and introduce an extremely weak state clean indoor air ordinance that exempted bars, restaurants, bowling alleys and bingo parlors. The Smoke Less Ohio initiative would also have preempted future local ordinances that were more strict and overturned 21 local ordinances in Ohio that were already in place. Health advocates (mainly the American Cancer Society) spent $ 2. 7 million supporting the Smoke Free Ohio campaign and tobacco interests (mainly RJ Reynolds) spent $ 6. 7 million supporting Smoke Less Ohio. On November 7, 2006, Ohio became the 15 th state in the US to go smoke free when the Smoke Free Ohio campaign passed with 58 % of voter in favor and the Smoke Less Ohio campaign failed with only 36 % of Ohioans in favor. While the law was enacted in December 2006, enforcement did not start until the Ohio Department of Health finalized enforcement rules, which it did in April 2007. During this delay, pro-tobacco interests worked to create confusion and undermine public support for and compliance with the law. Consequently public confusion and non compliance with Ohio’s new clean indoor air law was common. The American Cancer Society and other health groups generated a tremendous amount of political credibility when they successfully passed the Smoke Free Ohio initiative by a convincing margin. However, these health groups were nsuccessful in using their new political power along with underlying public support to aid implementation of Ohio’s clean indoor air law and to exert political pressure to restore funding for the Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{tobacco use}} in the United States has {{declined}} over the past 20 years, cigarette use among college students remains high. Additional research is thus needed to determine how university tobacco control policies and preventive education programs affect college students' smoking behaviors.

College smoking policies were obtained from a survey of college administrators and from college websites. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of individual smoking policies and programs on the odds of cigarette smoking. Results Of the individual programs, only having a preventive education program on campus was associated with lower odds of smoking. The existence of smoking cessation programs and designated smoking areas were associated with higher odds of smoking. Policies governing the sale and distribution of cigarettes were insignificantly associated with smoking.

The physical addiction to nicotine explains why over 30 % of Americans continue to smoke or use tobacco despite their desires and efforts to quit. The testimony summarized in this paper recommends four broad strategies for preventing tobacco-caused cancers in the United States: a) mandating and reimbursing effective treatments for nicotine addiction; b) increasing Federal and state tobacco excise taxes and earmarking a fraction of tax revenues for tobacco prevention and cessation; c) enacting other policy changes to prevent tobacco use and addiction among children, including expanded clean indoor air legislation, comprehensive youth tobacco access legislation, and the regulation of tobacco products and their advertising and promotion; and d) <b>expanding</b> <b>tobacco</b> control research and critical Federal research support.

Beyond its effects on morbidity and mortality, tobacco use has dramatic social and economic consequences, consuming healthcare budgets, robbing families of their primary wage earners, and hindering economic development.

40|$|Calls for {{institutional}} investors to divest (sell off) tobacco stocks threaten the industry's share values, publicise its bad behaviour, and label it as a politically unacceptable ally. US tobacco control advocates began urging government investment and pension funds to divest {{as a matter}} of responsible social policy in 1990. Following the initiation of Medicaid recovery lawsuits in 1994, advocates highlighted the contradictions between state justice departments suing the industry, and state health departments <b>expanding</b> <b>tobacco</b> control programmes, while state treasurers invested in tobacco companies. Philip Morris (PM), the most exposed US company, led the divestment opposition, consistently framing the issue as one of responsible fiscal policy. It insisted that funds had to be managed for the exclusive interest of beneficiaries, not the public at large, and for high share returns above all. This paper uses tobacco industry documents to show how PM sought to frame both the rhetorical contents and the legal contexts of the divestment debate. While tobacco stock divestment was eventually limited to only seven (but highly visible) states, US advocates focused public attention on the issue in at least 18 others plus various local jurisdictions. This added to ongoing, effective campaigns to denormalise and delegitimise the tobacco industry, dividing it from key allies. Divestment as a delegitimisation tool could have both advantages and disadvantages as a tobacco control strategy in other countries...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is no recent {{comprehensive}} global {{analysis of}} lung cancer mortality in women. We describe contemporary mortality rates and trends among women globally. Methods:Weused theWorldHealth Organization’s CancerMortality Database covering 65 populations on six continents to calculate age-standardized (1960 Segi world standard) lung cancer death rates during 2006 to 2010 and annual percent change in rates for available years from 1985 to 2011 {{and for the most}} recent five data years by population and age group (30 – 49 and 50 – 74 years). Results: Lung cancer mortality rates (per 100, 000) among young women (30 – 49 years) during 2006 to 2010 ranged from 0. 7 in Costa Rica to 14. 8 in Hungary. Rates among youngwomenwere stable or declining in 47 of 52 populations examined. Rates among women 50 to 74 years ranged from 8. 8 in Georgia and Egypt to 120. 0 in Scotland. In both age groups, rates were highest in parts of Europe (Scotland, Hungary, Denmark) and North America and lowest in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Rates in older women were increasing for more than half (36 / 64) of populations examined, including most countries in Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe and South America.

40|$|IntroductionAlthough {{tobacco control}} {{activity}} in the United States {{during the past several}} years has increased dramatically, tobacco use continues to have devastating consequences among all age cohorts. MethodsIn November 2003, a survey of tobacco control practices and policies in health insurance plans was conducted by America's Health Insurance Plans' national technical assistance office. The survey was the fourth and final survey conducted as part of the Addressing Tobacco in Managed Care program. Of the 215 plans in the sample, 160 (74 %) completed the survey. Collectively, these plans represent more than 60 million members of health maintenance organizations. ResultsFrom 1997 to 2003, health insurance plans have demonstrated increasing use of evidence-based programs and clinical guidelines to address tobacco use. The number of plans providing full coverage for any type of pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation has more than tripled since 1997. Plans have also shown substantial improvement in their ability to identify all or some of their members who smoke. Similarly, a greater percentage of plans are using strategies to address smoking cessation during treatment for other chronic diseases and after acute events such as a myocardial infarction. ConclusionDespite improvements, important opportunities remain for health insurance plans and other stakeholders to <b>expand</b> their <b>tobacco</b> control activities and transfer the lessons learned to other health problems...|$|R

Tobacco could be supplied through other non-profit enterprises. The elimination of profit driven behaviour from the supply of tobacco would enhance the ability of public health authorities to reduce tobacco use.

Plants that have been maintained in constant darkness for a prolonged period reinitiate the circadian rhythm upon illumination: the LHCP mRNA level resumes its rhythmic behavior with a period of roughly 24 hours. The same circadian fluctuation of LHCP mRNA is observed upon illuminating etiolated tobacco seedlings, demonstrating that the circadian rhythm is not dependent on the presence of mature chloroplasts. In vitro transcription experiments with nuclei isolated from green plants during various times of the day indicate that the diurnal as well as the circadian changes of the level of LHCP RNA are due, at least in part, to changes in the rate of LHCP mRNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} step in understanding influence of growth environment on carbon metabolism in plants is {{to gain a better}} understanding of effects of light quality on the photosynthetic system. Electron microscopy was used to study chloroplast ultrastructure in developing and fully <b>expanded</b> leaves of <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Burley 21). Brief exposures to red or far-red light at the end of each day during growth under controlled environments influenced granum size, granum number and starch grain accumulation in chloroplasts, and the concentration of sugars in leaf lamina. Far-red-treated leaves had chloroplasts with more but smaller grana than did red-treated leaves. Red light at the end of the photosynthetic period resulted in more and larger starch grains in the chloroplasts and a lower concentration of sugars in leaves. Chloroplast ultrastructure and starch grain accumulation patterns that were initiated in the expanding leaves were also evident in the fully expanded leaves that received the treatment during development. It appears that the phytochrome system in the developing leaves sensed the light environment and initiated events which influenced chloroplast development and partitioning of photosynthate to adapt the plant for better survival under those environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Oklahoma’s {{tobacco control}} program has made {{progress}} despite {{the challenges of}} inadequate program funding, an unsupportive political climate, and the pro-tobacco norm of its citizens. They have benefited from strong tobacco control leadership, a supportive network of tobacco control partners, and advances in secondhand smoke policy. These characteristics along with the strong commitment of the tobacco control community will continue to improve and <b>expand</b> Oklahoma’s <b>tobacco</b> control efforts. In fiscal year 02, Oklahoma dedicated approximately $ 3. 8 million ($ 1. 10 per capita) to tobacco control, meeting 17 % of CDC’s lower funding estimate. Community programs received {{nearly half of the}} funding, while enforcement and chronic disease programs received no funding from the tobacco control program. The establishment of the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust Fund (Trust) and securing funding from other sources, such as the CDC and the American Legacy Foundation, were viewed as financial successes. Significant challenges to the program were the lack of funding for the tobacco control program and the delay in the disbursement of the Trust money. Partners agreed that the goals were appropriate due to their synergism and ability to impact a large number of people. Although attempts to repeal preemption had been unsuccessful, the Board of Health’s Secondhand Smoke Rules Partners identified the following strengths and challenges of Oklahoma’s tobacco control program: • The dedication of tobacco control professionals and advocates was identified as a major strength of the program. • The cooperation and coordination of the tobacco control network was viewed as a strength, but many partners believed that the network could be stronger. • The lack of adequate funding was a huge impediment to the tobacco control program. • A lack of awareness about the importance of tobacco control and lack of support from the public was a barrier. • Major political barriers were the influence of the tobacco industry and the lack of legislative support for tobacco control...|$|R
40|$|Creating a {{sustainable}} program for long-term success” {{was the focus}} of Washington’s 2000 strategic plan. In 2002, this theme was still evident. While Washington was faced with some difficult challenges, the foundation had been laid to continue to improve and <b>expand</b> its <b>tobacco</b> control program. The program benefited from a supportive leadership, ample funding, a health conscious public, and an improving tobacco control network. For this evaluation, preventing youth initiation and promoting cessation were identified as the top two program goals for FY 2002. Partners agreed with these priorities, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating to the Legislature that the program was affecting prevalence rates. Minor changes to the list were suggested: broadening the definition of youth to include 18 - 24 year olds due to the targeting of this group by the tobacco industry; and including cessation for pregnant women as a sub-goal of promoting cessation. The statewide quit line was generally viewed as a successful activity, partly due to good promotion and continued evaluation. The partners identified the following strengths and challenges of Washington’s program: • The dedication and experience of the tobacco control professionals and advocates was identified as a major strength of the program, with recognition specifically given to the DOH program staff. • The timely development of a detailed strategic state plan that continued to provide guidance beyond {{the first year of the}} program was viewed as a strength. • The very existence of a tobacco control network was identified as a positive factor. However, the lack of cohesiveness among partners was seen as a challenge. • While some thought that the current funding level of the program was a positive factor, most felt that more funding was needed to reach the CDC minimum funding level. • Major political challenges were the state budget crisis and the securitization of future MSA funds. • The lack of capacity/infrastructure at the local and state levels also impeded the implementation of tobacco control activitie...|$|R
