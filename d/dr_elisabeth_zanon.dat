50|$|ÖVP vice federal {{chairwoman}}, vice state chairwoman for Tyrol {{and former}} state councillor <b>Elisabeth</b> <b>Zanon</b> resigned all her party offices and even publicly considered renouncing her party membership {{after she was}} not confirmed as a Tyrolean state councillor in the new cabinet of former interior minister and new governor Günther Platter after the 2008 election in Tyrol, stating that the new political style was unacceptable to her. ÖVP MP and former state secretary for infrastructure Helmut Kukacka announced on 23 July 2008 that he would also stand down from politics and go into business instead. Carinthian ÖVP MP Klaus Auer also retired, stating his dislike for the current kind of politics in Carinthia (referring especially to Haider's populist actions). MPs Karl Freund, Walter Murauer and Edeltraud Lentsch will also retire. Health minister Andrea Kdolsky said {{she would like to}} stay on as minister and initially claimed that it had not yet been decided whether she would stand as a candidate on the ÖVP's lists, but later announced she would not stand on the party's lists. On 20 August 2008, it became apparent that Kdolsky would not serve any political function after the election, reportedly because of internal dissent over her popularity; she had reportedly been strongly lobbied by many party members to withdraw from politics. Economy minister Martin Bartenstein announced he would not be willing to stay as minister in a government led by Faymann, voicing preferences for an ÖVP-FPÖ-BZÖ coalition instead. When Faymann stated that he would lay claim to the foreign ministry for the SPÖ after the election in coalition negotiations, Schüssel strongly rebuked him on 5 September 2008, criticising the SPÖ's party line on the EU and on foreign affairs in general.|$|R

Este artículo es acerca de Frieda NADIG y <b>Dr.</b> <b>Elisabeth</b> SELBERT. En primer lugar, se explicará la metodología y las fuentes del material de base. Posteriormente, se presentan las biografías de los dos miembros femeninos del Parlamento social demócrata a partir de que fueron miembros del Consejo Parlamentario. Se debatirá el periodo nacional socialista ya que constituye la base para el trabajo posterior acerca del trabajo de ambas. En tercer lugar, su lucha política para la introducción de la frase: "hombres y mujeres tienen los mismos derechos" en la Constitución de la República Alemana.

This paper is about its members Frieda NADIG and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Elisabeth</b> SELBERT. First the methodology and the body of source material will be elucidated. Thereafter, the biographies of the two female members of Social Democrats in the parliament will be introduced up to the point when they were both members of the parliamentary council.

5000|$|Gerd Puin was {{the head}} of a {{restoration}} project, commissioned by the Yemeni government, which spent a significant amount of time examining the ancient Qur'anic manuscripts discovered in Sana'a, Yemen, in 1972, in order to find criteria for systematically cataloging them. According to writer Toby Lester, his examination revealed [...] "unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography and artistic embellishment." [...] The scriptures were written in the early Hijazi Arabic script, matching the pieces of the earliest Qur'ans known to exist. Some of the papyrus on which the text appears shows clear signs of earlier use, being that previous, washed-off writings are also visible on it.

Douglas had been friends of Bryher and Macpherson since 1931. Macpherson remained on Capri until Douglas's death in 1952, writing an epitaph for Douglas, from which the Latin inscription, on Douglas's gravestone, is derived (Omnes Eodem Cogimur).Macpherson then moved to Rome, where he published his third novel, 'Rome 12 Noon'.

40|$|Individuals with Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} (PWS) are at {{risk for}} psychopathology due to their maladaptive behavior profile. This study investigated the self-concept of these individuals to better understand the origin and manifestation of their psychopathology. In this cross-sectional study, 128 individuals with PWS were administered semi-projective and behavioral measures to gain an introspective analysis of their self-concept. Results showed a positive correlation between age and negative statements about the physical self, and positive statements about the non-physical self. There was a negative correlation between BMI and negative self statements, where individuals with a normal weight had the highest average frequency of negative statements about the non-physical self. Thus, demographic features of individuals with PWS may predict aspects of their self-concept, which could have implications for prevention and treatment of psychopathology.
