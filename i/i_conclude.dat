An injunction will issue preventing the defendants and their agents from refusing these plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, admission to School No. 29 because of their color.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of Gennaro's {{histological}} studies and the present amino acid and Cu and Fe analyses, <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that, to the extent the preserved O. giganteus tissue {{is representative of the}} carcass washed ashore at St. Augustine, Florida, in November 1896, it was essentially a huge mass of collagenous protein. Certainly, the tissue was not blubber. I interpret these results as consistent with, and supportive of, Webb and Verrill's identification of the carcass as that of a gigantic cephalopod, probably an octopus, not referable to any known species.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, {{seeking more}} {{professional}} orchestral experience, Elgar {{was employed to}} play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom he would play every concert {{for the next seven}} years and where he later claimed he [...] "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the Sérénade mauresque – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled [...] "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience." [...] Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, [...] "My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, so sometimes <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money– not a cent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moore, {{who was a}} mountaineer {{and pilot}} as well as {{president}} of the University of Alaska, told journalists the C-124 [...] "obviously was flying at full speed" [...] and appeared to have slid down the cliffs of Mount Gannett and exploded. Wreckage was spread across several acres of the glacier. Moore surmised that the pilot had narrowly missed other Chugach Range peaks during his approach.

From the extent and richness of the evidence it seems that the Theravada was the predominant school, and that it enjoyed the patronage of ruling and economic elites. But I do not mean to suggest that religious society was monolithic: other schools may well have been present, or have come and gone, and there is ample evidence ...|$|E
2500|$|In January, Conservative Party {{deputy leader}} Per-Kristian Foss {{said that the}} party would not sit in a {{government}} without Erna Solberg as prime minister and claimed that both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals agreed with this policy.

2500|$|Foreign Policy {{journalist}} Thomas E.

[...] Americans are not merely ambivalent about the situation, but they [...] "don't think it is their problem." [...] According to Ricks, [...] "the American system is founded on the belief that the people do indeed know what is best for them. So <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that Power's argument is itself yet another reason not to intervene in Syria -- if we have to erode our system to do it, it certainly is not worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2000, the FFRF brought suit, as {{taxpayers in}} the state of Wisconsin, against Faith Works located in Milwaukee. Their case stated that a faith-based addiction-{{treatment}} program should not be used as a court ordered treatment program using taxpayer funds. In January 2002 the ruling was decided in the FFRF's favor; that receiving {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in public money is in violation of the Establishment Clause. The judge wrote [...] "Because I find that the Department of Workforce Development's grant to Faith Works constitutes unrestricted, direct funding of an organization that engages in religious indoctrination, <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that this funding stream violates the establishment clause." [...] On Appeal, in April 2003, The Seventh Circuit later ruled against the FFRF on the narrower issue of whether prisoners joining specific faith-based programs on their own free will are coerced by government endorsement of religion.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1978 abstract, {{comparing}} McFate Artifacts at the McJunkin {{site with}} Johnston and Squirrel Hill sites in western Pennsylvania, Richard L. George states, [...] "It was {{suggested that the}} McFate presence on the McJunkin site {{may have been the}} result of foreign potters, namely women, living among the resident Monongahela... and suggests a major population movement from the north in the 16th century and an amalgamation of peoples speaking dissimilar languages." [...] During this century Stadacona and Hochelaga (Jacques Cartier 1535–1536) had disappeared, and the tribes along the shores of the St. Lawrence were no longer those of Huron-Iroquois stock, but Algonquian (Journ, 183-84; Clev. ed XXXVIII, 181). To quote Richard L. George of the Pennsylvania Archaeology Society, [...] "I believe that some of the Monongahela were of Algonquin origin... Other scholars have suggested that Iroquoian speakers were interacting with Late Monongahela people, and additional evidence is presented to confirm this. <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that the archaeologically conceived term, Monongahela, likely encompasses speakers of several languages, including Siouan." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{watershed}} of the Monongahela River {{is within}} the northwestern Alleghenies, and it is from it that the Monongahela culture takes its name. The Godwin-Portman site (36AL39) located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a possible Fort Ancient (c. AD 850 to 1680) presence during the 15th century. Washington Boro ceramics have been found on the Barton (18AG3) and Llewellyn (18AG26) sites in Maryland on the northeastern slopes of the late Susquehannock sequence. The early Monongahela (c. AD 900 to 1630) are called the Drew Tradition in Pennsylvania. According to Richard L. George: [...] "I believe {{that some of the}} Monongahela were of Algonquin origin.... Other scholars have suggested that Iroquoian speakers were interacting with Late Monongahela people, and additional evidence is presented to confirm this. <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> that the archaeologically conceived term, Monongahela, likely encompasses speakers of several languages, including Siouan." [...] According to Dr Maslowski of West Virginia in 2009: [...] "The New River Drainage and upper Potomac represents the range of the Huffman Phase (Page) hunting and gathering area or when it is found in small amounts on village sites, trade ware or Page women being assimulated into another village (tribe)." [...] Finally, according to Prof Potter of Virginia, they [...] had occupied the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies on the upper Potomac to the northern, lower Shenandoah Valley region before the A.D. 1300 Luray Phase (Algonquian) peoples' [...] "invasion". It is thought that these ancient Alleghenians were pushed from the classic Huffman Phase of the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies to the Blue Ridge Mountains in western Virginia, which was eastern Siouan territory.|$|E
