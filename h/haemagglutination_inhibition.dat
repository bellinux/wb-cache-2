40|$|A {{panel of}} 24 {{monoclonal}} ntibodies (MAbs) to the G 1 or G 2 envelope glycoproteins of Hantaan virus {{were used to}} determine the surface topography and functional properties of antigenic sites. Nine distinct, partially overlapping antigenic sites, two on G 1 and seven on G 2, were demonstrated by competitive binding assays. Analyses of the antigenic sites by <b>haemagglutination</b> (HA) <b>inhibition</b> and plaque-reduction neutralization tests howed that all of the sites, except one on G 1, were related to viral HA. Only one of the G 1 antigenic sites and two of the G 2 sites were involved in virus neutralization. These results suggest hat certain epitopes related to HA were not critical for virus neutralization. The nine antigenic sites could be further divided into 13 based upon the serological cross-reactivity of MAbs with viruses representative of each of the four known antigenic groups within the Hantavirus genus of Bunyaviridae, i. e. Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala and Prospect Hill viruses...|$|R
40|$|Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) and {{influenza}} viruses {{attach to}} human erythrocytes causing haemagglutination of the cells. Sialoglycoproteins, containing predominantly glycophorin A, from these cells behave as soluble virus receptors and inhibit haemagglutination by both viruses. Removal of 43 % of the sialic acid from erythrocytes with neuraminidase prevented th irhaemagglutination by EMC virus while loss of 40 % of glycophorin sialic acid destroyed its inhibitory properties against his virus. However, about 80 % of the sialic acid {{had to be}} removed from erythrocytes or from glycophorin to achieve the same results for influenza virus. Trypsin treatment of erythrocytes or glycophorin had little effect on <b>haemagglutination</b> r <b>inhibition</b> involving either virus, although the glycopeptides released contain up to 70 % of the total sialic acid, {{and despite the fact that}} glycophorin was drastically reduced in size as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis.

50|$|On August 6, 2013, the British Medical Journal {{released}} {{the results of}} epidemiological investigations conducted after a family cluster of two patients were infected with avian H7N9 in March 2013 and later died in April and May. A 60-year-old man became infected after an exposure to poultry and his daughter, {{who had not been}} exposed to poultry but had cared for her ill father, became infected as well. Genome sequence and analyses of phylogenetic trees showed that both viruses were almost genetically identical. Forty-three close contacts of the infected patients did not become ill and they all tested negative for <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> antibodies specific for avian H7N9. It was concluded that the infection of the daughter probably resulted from close contact with her father during unprotected exposure, suggesting that the virus was able to transmit from person to person. However, the researchers consider that the transmissibility of the virus remains limited and non-sustainable.|$|E
40|$|During {{surveillance}} of the swine population in Israel a haemagglutinating agent was isolated and {{identified as a}} paramyxovirus (PMV).

However, comprehensive HI and NI cross-reaction tests between the isolate and PMV- 3 reference strains, on the one hand, and the other eight avian PMV serotypes, on the other hand, showed that the viruses compared differed in terms of their antigenic interrelationships with the other avian PMVs and also in the quantitative values of the cross-reactivity. This is interpreted to mean that the swine isolate and the avian PMV- 3 prototype strain are different viruses, although very closely related, but are not different isolations of the same virus from avian and mammalian hosts...|$|R

40|$|Attachment, {{the first}} stage of viral infection, was {{investigated}} using Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus and Krebs II ascites tumour cells (Krebs cells). The initial stage of the research was concerned with the Krebs cell surface, which was found to consist of a plasma membrane and a glycocalyx. Plasma membranes from Krebs cells, the purity of which was determined by marker enzyme assays, electron microscopy and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), contained about 20 coomassie blue staining components (proteins) and one periodic acid Schiff’s (PAS) staining component (glycoprotein) of apparent molecular weight 225, 000 daltons as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Three of the major proteins were labeled when Krebs plasma membranes were iodinated but the glycoprotein component was not labeled.

40|$|Although the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> assay is {{considered}} the "gold standard" for antigenic characterisation of influenza viruses, some limitations of this technique are well known. A new microneutralisation assay, {{as a tool for}} antigenic characterisation of influenza B viruses, has been standardised and its performance evaluated in comparison with the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> test in the light of molecular characterisation of the haemagglutinin. Twelve B viruses belonging to the two lineages and the four sub-lineages discriminated by phylogenetic analysis of HA were tested. The microneutralisation assay clearly distinguishes viruses belonging to different lineages and, in addition, discriminates strains belonging to different sub-lineages that are poorly or not discriminated using the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> test. This new microneutralisation assay could provide a useful tool for antigenic characterisation of circulating influenza viruses and contribute, together with the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> test and sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, in the choice of the strain for use in vaccine composition...|$|E

40|$|Hyperlipidaemia, {{glomerulonephritis}} and IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy {{were found}} to be associated in two patients (Ler. and Lac.). A severe atherosclerosis was also present in the former patient. After a purification–activation procedure active IgG λ was obtained from the serum chylomicra and from the ammonium sulphate-precipitated serum gamma-globulins. In passive <b>haemagglutination</b> tests, including <b>inhibition</b> tests, the IgG λ Ler. reacted specifically with the protein moiety of human low density lipoproteins (LDL) and the IgG λ Lac. reacted with human, rat and rabbit very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as well as with human serum albumin (HSA). These IgG λ behaved like autoantibodies though no activity was found in whole serum, in which they are probably blocked by the corresponding antigens. They are very similar, although not identical, to the autoantibodies found in auto-immune hyperlipidaemia (AIH) and it is proposed that in these patients the hyperlipidaemia is a variety of AIH. Finally it is suggested that the hyperlipidaemia associated with glomerulonephritis chiefly in the nephrotic syndrome may sometimes be AIH. If this is the case the renal lesions and the hyperlipidaemia may be different expressions of an immune complex disease which may also lead to other tissue lesions such as atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|A {{decrease}} in the egg quality, production, fertility and hatchability without serious clinical signs of illness was recorded in turkey fl ocks in Croatia {{at the beginning of}} 2002. It was assumed that the egg drop syndrome virus might be one of the etiological agents responsible for the abnormalities in the egg production. The systematic serological monitoring, using a <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> test, showed that the antibodies to the egg drop syndrome virus existed in 94. 4 and 55. 1 % of the sera analysed in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> titres ranged from 16 to 128. The sera samples were randomly collected from 11 - to 46 -week-old hens from the affected fl ocks. The serological evidence of the egg drop syndrome virus infection was confi rmed by detection of the presence of the virus genome in the turkey sera by the polymerase chain reaction. Vaccination of the 18 - and 25 -week-old turkey hens against the egg drop syndrome virus started in March 2003. After this period, the presence of antibodies to the egg drop syndrome virus (the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> titres between 16 and 256) was found in 96. 7 % of the analysed sera, while the egg production reached normal or higher values for the Nicholas hybrid line of turkeys.
