5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, Moscow and Paris. Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City with photographs of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> at Chicago's Institute of Design, {{some of which were}} published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E

5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{basis for}} Family Guy was MacFarlane's thesis film The Life of Larry, created in 1995 while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> at the Rhode Island School of Design.

5|$|By November, Victoria and Albert had {{returned}} to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales {{had returned}} to Cambridge, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student.</b> Two of Albert's cousins, King Pedro V and Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, died of typhoid fever. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen's clubs and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair. In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

A cavalry officer at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, Nansouty was commissioned as an aide-de-camp to Marshal Nicolas Luckner. During the First Coalition, he saw service as a lieutenant-colonel and squadron commander in the 9th (heavy) Cavalry Regiment, campaigning with the French armies on the Rhine and in Germany. Promoted to Colonel in 1793 and given the command of the 9th Cavalry, he was noted for several well-led cavalry actions.

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> in {{the years}} 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied {{theology}} and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769.

On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners.|$|E
5|$|The hermitage is {{believed}} to have been founded by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “site investigation” (sa brtag) to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery. The Dalai Lama made the treasure (gter) discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang’s lower temple. However, the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to Phrin las rgya mtsho's nephew, Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in around 1696.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth {{became a}} monk at Glastonbury, then was made {{dean of the}} monastery of Christ Church Priory, at Canterbury, the cathedral chapter for the diocese of Canterbury. He was also a {{chaplain}} to King Cnut of England and Denmark as well as Dean of Canterbury when on 13 November 1020 Æthelnoth was consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelnoth's elevation probably was a gesture of appeasement, as Æthelnoth's brother Æthelweard had been executed in 1017 by Cnut, who also banished a brother-in-law named Æthelweard in 1020. A later story stated that Cnut favoured Æthelnoth because Æthelnoth had bestowed chrism on the king. This may be a garbled account of Æthelnoth's participation in Cnut's confirmation as a Christian in 1016 or his coronation in 1017. There are some indications that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> of Ælfric of Eynsham, the homilist.|$|E
