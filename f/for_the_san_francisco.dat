5|$|Linderman {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Director of the Mint and Pollock became Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. In July 1873, production began on the dies needed to strike the coins. During this time, in a telegram to Pollock, Linderman asked that production of trade dollars be hastened because Mexico was preparing to issue another series of dollars with the older design popular in Asia, a design that was discontinued in 1866. The first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on July 11, 1873. Forty thousand pieces were issued in the first release, on July 14. The Carson City Mint received its first dies for the new coins on July 22, and those intended <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Mint arrived shortly after. In total, 396,635 business strikes and 865 proof coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint {{during the first year}} of production. The Carson City and San Francisco mints struck 124,500 and 703,000 coins respectively.|$|E
5|$|The first Susan B. Anthony dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on December 13, 1978. First strikes at the Denver and San Francisco Mints {{followed}} on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively. Mint officials {{feared that the}} coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered {{the creation of a}} stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979. The dollars all bore a mint mark denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Mint. The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' mint mark since the Jefferson nickel issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin. In 1980, the 'P' mint mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia.|$|E
