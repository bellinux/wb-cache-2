25|$|The {{collecting}} of sculpture, {{including that}} of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern museum was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, {{and the ability to}} transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction. Small decorative figurines, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by modern and Contemporary art) {{as they were in the}} Rococo, or in ancient Greece when Tanagra figurines were a major industry, or in East Asian and Pre-Columbian art. Small sculpted <b>fittings</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the Nimrud ivories, Begram ivories and finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between sustainable development and competitiveness of organizations {{in order to identify}} whether the innovations driven by corporate policies of sustainability organizational influence on the competitiveness of Duratex; Brazilian company producer of wood products, pottery and metal <b>fittings,</b> <b>for</b> the <b>furniture</b> industry and construction. This work consists of theoretical, explaining concepts related to the competitiveness of organizations, sustainable development and business innovation, as well as the relationships between them. The survey was an exploratory, qualitative approach through the strategy of the case study of Duratex and lifting techniques of documentary evidence, secondary, semi-structured interviews and observation. Analyses of the interviews were conducted according to the technique of textual analysis and point to results showing that Duratex entered sustainability in their strategic and operational management, having profited from innovations in products and processes in search of balance between social, ecological and economic practices distributed throughout the production chain. Thus, innovations are raised oriented toward sustainability, and business performance results indicate that not only innovative, but the management-oriented sustainability Duratex contributes to it and the company’s competitive position...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGeometrical {{deviations}} {{can appear}} {{in the production of}} plug contacts used in electrical connection technology and in <b>fittings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>furniture</b> industry. The reasons for this can be a variation in the properties of the semi-finished product, or wear phenomena on the forming machine itself or on the bending tools. When geometrical deviations appear, the process parameters normally have to be adjusted manually. Finding the most appropriate process parameters is currently done manually and is thus very time consuming. In order to reduce the scrap rate and the setup time for production scenarios, a concept for self-correcting bending operations is being developed using the V-model of the VDI guideline 2206. In this case, the V-model will make it possible to set up a self-correcting control strategy consisting of a closed-loop control approach, measurement devices and actuators. Having implemented these components in the forming machines, {{it will be possible to}} recognize geometrical deviations automatically and to take corrective action during production, aiming at a reduction of the scrap rate and setup-time...|$|R

40|$|Most {{pieces of}} case {{furniture}} (kitchen and bathroom furniture, cabinets, wardrobes, tables and etc.) {{are made of}} 18  mm thick wood particle boards finished with various coatings. This three-layered constructional material is obtained by bonding wood particles of different fractions with synthetic resins using heating. The exploitation duration and quality of case furniture {{is determined by the}} mechanical properties of wood particle boards and the construction of joints of wood-based panels. On a frequent basis, pieces of case furniture with non-dismantable and dismantable construction are joined by using multidowel glued joints and cam connecting <b>fittings</b> intended <b>for</b> <b>furniture,</b> respectively. Wood-based panels can be joined with mitre joints whose mechanical properties have not undergone testing and comparison with regular joints when applying insertable wooden dowels or furniture connecting fittings. During the testing of particle board properties it was established that joining wood-based panels in this way ensures most efficient use of mechanical characteristics of the particleboard. In addition to the properties of the mitre joint, the tests also allowed determining the bending strength, tensile strength and bonding strength of the constructional material, and providing an original method for testing board properties, which can be successfully applied to the prediction of properties of the mitre joint. Tests were performed by using a universal tensile testing machine P- 0. 5. Joints were bonded by applying PVA dispersion. The surface of boards was veneered by using mahogany veneer and urea formaldehyde resin. It was found that mitre joints of wood particle boards can withstand loads that are higher from 2 to 4 times, in comparison to glued doweled joints or joints constructed with cam connecting fittings.

She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and it was from the 2nd Baron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|R

Not to luxury of the eye, that is a holy luxury; Nature ministers to that in her painted meadows, and {{sculptured}} forests, and gilded heavens; the Gothic builder ministered to that in his twisted traceries, and deep-wrought foliage, and burning casements. The dead Renaissance drew back into its earthliness, out of all that was warm and heavenly; back into its pride, out of all that was simple and kind; back into its stateliness, out of all that was impulsive, reverent, and gay. But it understood the luxury of the body; the terraced and scented and grottoed garden, with its trickling fountains and slumbrous shades; the spacious hall and lengthened corridor for the summer heat; the well-closed windows, and perfect <b>fittings</b> and <b>furniture,</b> <b>for</b> defence against the cold; and the soft picture, and frescoed wall and roof, covered with the last lasciviousness of Paganism;--this is understood and possessed to the full, and still possesses. This {{is the kind of}} domestic architecture on which we pride ourselves, even to this day, as an infinite and honorable advance from the rough habits of our ancestors; from the time when the king's floor was strewn with rushes, and the tapestries swayed before the searching wind in the baron's hall.|$|R
