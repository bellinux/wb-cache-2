50|$|Tap changers {{typically}} use numerous {{tap selector}} switches {{which may not}} be switched under load, broken into even and odd banks, and switch between the banks with a heavy-duty <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> which can switch between them under load. The result operates like a dual-clutch transmission, with the tap selector switches taking the place of the gearbox and the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> taking the place of the clutch.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> {{powerful}} springs are tensioned by a low power motor (motor drive unit, MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a vacuum bottle contact in parallel with the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch.</b> During a tap change operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> contacts.|$|E
50|$|Some arcing is unavoidable, {{and both}} the tap changer oil and the switch {{contacts}} will slowly deteriorate with use. To prevent contamination of the tank oil and facilitate maintenance operations, the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> usually operates in a separate compartment from the main transformer tank, and often the tap selector switches will {{be located in the}} compartment as well. All of the winding taps will then be routed into the tap changer compartment through a terminal array.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{on-load tap changer}} (OLTC) design that {{provides}} the traditional advantages of the semiconductor-assisted OLTC over the classic, mechanical OLTC. The design provides zero-current, zero-voltage operation of both <b>diverter</b> <b>switches</b> at all times, eliminating contact wear due to arcing. The design of the diverter sub-circuit is discussed, including {{the introduction of a}} voltage source and corresponding control loop that provides the necessary shunt current or voltage to create the desired zero conditions in the <b>diverter</b> <b>switches.</b> The design differs from existing semiconductor-assisted OLTC systems {{by the fact that the}} semiconductor portion of the system is connected in a purely shunt configuration to the main current path. Under normal conditions the load current flows only in the selector and <b>diverter</b> <b>switches</b> making the system very low loss...|$|R
40|$|A new hybrid {{diverter}} {{design for}} an On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) is presented and experimentally validated. The design differs from existing semiconductor-assisted OLTC systems {{in that the}} part of the system containing semiconductor devices is connected in a purely shunt con guration to the main current path, resulting in a system that is electrically robust and very low loss. The new design provides zero-current, zero-voltage operation of both <b>diverter</b> <b>switches</b> at all times, eff ectively eliminating arc-induced contact wear. Contact lifetime of over twenty-five million operations is demonstrated. Contact wear rates under the new design are compared experimentally with those under alternative contact protection schemes and are shown to be dramatically reduced. A fast electromechanical switch intended for use under the new hybrid diverter is presented. The low-wear conditions created by the new diverter allows a dramatic reduction in the switch moving mass when compared to that of the standard OLTC, allowing sub-half-cycle actuation times to be achieved. A study of switch topology is made in order to guide the design process. An analysis of a magnetic actuator providing both high actuation and static contact forces is also presented. In a second strand of this thesis, a general method of formulating optimal modulation problems for thin power electronic systems incorporating a buck converter is presented. The method is employs a frequency domain representation of the buck converter where the describing equations are formed into a square matrix relating a set of input harmonics to sets of output harmonics. This allows the interaction between the buck converter and a set of linear filters to be modelled in a systematic way. Two example circuits, the Inverter-Less Active Filter and the Controllable Network Transformer, are used as example problems. The use of general-purpose optimisation software for finding optimal modulation waveforms for these circuits is demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{tap changer}} physically makes the new connection before releasing the old using multiple tap selector switches but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type tap changer, the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type tap changer uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type tap changer is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil. The current line entries for the 132 kV switch house are North Greetwell - Lincoln 1, Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 2, North Greetwell - Lincoln 2 and Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 1 ...|$|E
40|$|The Cygnus Dual Beam Radiographic Facility {{consists}} of two 2. 25 -MV, 60 -kA, 50 -ns x-ray sources fielded in an underground laboratory at the Nevada Test Site. The tests performed in this laboratory involve study of the dynamic properties of plutonium and are called subcritical experiments. From end-to-end, the Cygnus machines utilize the following components: Marx generator, water-filled pulse-forming line (PFL), waterfilled coaxial transmission line (WTL), 3 -cell inductive voltage adder (IVA), and rod-pinch diode. The upstream WTL interface to the PFL is via a radial insulator with coaxial geometry. The downstream WTL terminates in a manifold where the center conductor splits into three lines which individually connect {{to each of the}} IVA cell inputs. There is an impedance mismatch at this juncture. It is a concern that a reflected pulse due to anomalous behavior in the IVA or diode might initiate breakdown upon arrival at the upstream PFL/WTL insulator. Therefore near the beginning of the WTL a radial <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> is installed to protect the insulator from over voltage and breakdown. The diverter has adjustable gap spacing, and an in-line aqueous-solution (sodium thiosulfate) resistor array for energy dissipation. There are capacitive voltage probes {{at both ends of the}} WTL and on the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch.</b> These voltage signals will be analyzed to determine diverter performance. Using this analysis the usefulness of the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> will be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{novel model}} of fully {{electronic}} on load semiconductor tap changer for power transformer has been proposed. With high power semiconductor devices, {{problems associated with}} conventional mechanical {{on load tap changers}} which includes excessive conduction losses and arcing in the <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> have been properly rectified. In this work Simulink model was designed with GTOs as switching devices embedded in taps. Step change of voltage is achieved changing taps by switching GTOs and fine voltage with error less than Â± 0. 1 % is obtained by sequential firing control between GTOs in the system, which is not possible in conventional automatic OLTC control system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast mechanical <b>diverter</b> <b>switch</b> design suitable for new âarclessâ hybrid onload tap-changing systems. In such systems, arcing at contact separation and contact closure is almost completely eliminated by {{the inclusion of}} alternate current paths incorporating semiconductor devices. This allows the use of compact, air-insulated mechanical contacts that {{do not need to}} withstand significant arc erosion or provide arc quenching. As a result, the moving mass and the drive system for the switch may be dramatically reduced in size, leading to low inertia of the moving parts and resulting in very rapid operation times. An integrated, high-torque, low-mass permanent-magnet actuator is presented that provides detent (unpowered) contact force coupled with a cantilever spring contact system sized for an 11 -kV 2 -MVA onload tap changer. The design delivers operation times of under 20 ms and is capable of sustaining more than $ 10 ^{ 6 }$ operations. The complete design is experimentally verified under representative electrical conditions, and contact wear levels comparable to pure mechanical (zero current) operation are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The on-load {{tap changer}} (OLTC) is an {{inevitable}} part of a regulating transformer, which allows the fluent regulation of the power parameters on load without interruption. The purpose of the OLTC is on load switching on the transformer's primary side. This arrangement has to be reliable because of the setting of all parameters into network, namely current, voltage and power output. From there the constructional demands on switching devices appear, which are divided into on-load changers, off-load changers and off-circuit changers. Particularly OLTC is the most sophisticated arrangement among them and it consists of these parts: a <b>diverter</b> <b>switch,</b> upper part, selector, motor-drive unit and a driving shaft. The aim of the thesis was to analyze the technical function of these parts, to indicate important options and demands on functionality and trouble-free operation of the system, and to indicate and justify the possible direction of the OLTC development tendency and to present the kind of diagnostics. The result {{of the work is}} the presentation of a modern tap changing system TADS and its perspectives of using in regulation transformers.
