50|$|The term Girocheque {{quickly became}} {{associated}} with welfare dependence. Worse still, {{the name was}} often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques {{did not need to}} have (and most did not have) a <b>giro</b> <b>account,</b> girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques.|$|R

This would also speed up the national bank payment clearing system based on local bank branches and centralised cheque exchange requiring cheques to be returned to local branches. This had (and to this day still has) a 3-5 day clearing cycle.|$|R

50|$|Giropay offers merchants a {{real-time}} {{payment method}} (publicized as virtually risk-free) to accept internet payments. For customers, Giropay {{uses the same}} environment as their banks' online banking sites. The level of security depends on the participating bank. Some German Banks offer two-factor authentication (2FA), such as a challenge-response access token based on the chip embedded in the debit card or ATM card. Others, however, offer simpler PIN and TAN based online banking services. No sensitive information is being shared with the merchant, such as credit card or <b>Giro</b> <b>account</b> numbers. There is no chargeback right however, which {{can be considered a}} disadvantage for the consumer using this payment method. This is considered an advantage to the merchants.|$|R

40|$|ZnO {{thin films}} were grown by pulsed laser {{deposition}} on three different substrates: sapphire (0 [*] 0 [*] 0 [*] 1), MgO (1 [*] 0 [*] 0) and fused silica (FS). The structure and morphology {{of the films}} were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy and defect {{studies were carried out}} using slow positron implantation spectroscopy (SPIS). Films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> all substrates studied in this work exhibit the wurtzite ZnO structure and are characterized by an average crystallite size of 20 – 100 nm. However, strong differences in the microstructure of films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> various substrates were found. The ZnO films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> MgO and sapphire single-crystalline substrates exhibit local epitaxy, i. e. a well-defined relation between film crystallites and the substrate. Domains with different orientation relationships with the substrate were found in both films. On the other hand, the film <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the FS substrate exhibits fibre texture with random lateral orientation of crystallites. Extremely high compressive in-plane stress of σ ~ 14 GPa was determined in the film <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the MgO substrate, while the film <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> sapphire is virtually stress-free, and the film <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the FS substrate exhibits a tensile in-plane stress of σ ~ 0. 9 GPa. SPIS investigations revealed that the concentration of open-volume defects in the ZnO films is substantially higher than that in a bulk ZnO single crystal. Moreover, the ZnO films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> MgO and sapphire single-crystalline substrates exhibit a significantly higher density of defects than the film <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the amorphous FS substrate...|$|R

The efficiencies of the cells <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> FTO, ITO/SnO 2 and ITO were 8. 1 %, 8. 9 % and 11. 5 % respectively. Analysis of current-voltage-temperature measurements showed that the current transport of the cells <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> FTO or ITO/SnO 2 was apparently controlled by recombination/generation in the depletion layer and also by the interface recombination and tunneling, whereas that for the cell <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> ITO was controlled by both interface recombination and tunneling.

40|$|Titanium nitride {{films of}} a {{thickness}} of similar to 1. 5 mu m were <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> amorphous and crystalline substrates by DC reactive magnetron sputtering {{at ambient temperature}} with 100 % nitrogen in the sputter gas. The growth of nanostructured, i. e. crystalline nano-grain sized, films at ambient temperature is demonstrated. The microstructure of the films grown on crystalline substrates reveals a larger grain size/crystallite size {{than that of the}} films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> amorphous substrates. Specular reflectance measurements <b>on</b> films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> different substrates indicate that the position of the Ti-N 2 s band at 2. 33 eV is substrate-dependent, indicating substrate-mediated stoichiometry. This clearly demonstrates that not only structure and microstructure, but also chemical composition of the films is substrate-influenced. The films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> amorphous substrates display lower hardness and modulus values than the films <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> crystalline substrates, with the highest value of hardness being 19 GPa on a lanthanum aluminate substrate.

For external reflection measurements of thin films of organic molecules <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> flat surfaces, the optical constants of the substrate determine the nature of the spectrum. When the film thickness exceeds {{about a quarter of a}} wavelength, the effect of diffuse reflectance becomes apparent. The signal-to-noise ratio and base-line flatness of diffuse reflectance or diffuse transmittance spectra of samples <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> powdered substrates are too poor to allow either technique to be used beneficially for supercritical fluid chromatography/Fourier transform Infrared spectrometry measurements.
