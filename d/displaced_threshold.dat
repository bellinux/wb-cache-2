500|$|On 17 January 2008, British Airways Flight 38, a Boeing 777-200ER G-YMMM, from Beijing to London crash-landed {{approximately}} [...] {{short of}} London Heathrow Airport's runway 27L, and slid onto the runway's <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold.</b> The aircraft sustained damage to its landing gear, wing roots and engines, {{resulting in the}} first hull loss of a Boeing 777. There were no fatalities, {{but there was one}} serious injury and 12 minor injuries. The accident was caused by icing in the fuel system, resulting in a loss of power.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} impacted {{the ground}} [...] {{to the left}} and abeam the <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> of Runway 24in about a 10 degrees nose down attitude. At the time of impact, aircraft‟s heading was 220 degrees and its speed was [...] Following the impact, the aircraft skipped, started breaking up, skidded along the ground and rolled inverted before coming to a halt. During this process, parts of the aircraft including undercarriage, engines, wings and tail section sheared off. There were 32 fatalities, with the sole survivor a Congolese journalist.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, 1982, World Airways Flight 30 from Newark to Boston made a {{non-precision}} {{instrument approach}} to runway 15R and touched down [...] past the <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> on an icy runway. When the crew sensed that the DC-10-30-CF couldn't be {{stopped on the}} remaining runway, they steered the DC-10 {{off the side of}} the runway to avoid the approach light pier, and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. The nose section separated as the DC-10 came to rest [...] past the runway end, [...] left of the extended centerline. Two passengers (a father and son) were never found and are presumed to have been swept out to sea.|$|E
50|$|Thresholds {{are counted}} {{as part of}} the runway, and are {{included}} in the runway size. When viewing a runway's size with <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds,</b> one must find out how long the <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds</b> are in order to calculate the available landing distance.|$|R
50|$|Runway length {{does not}} include 122 m <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds</b> on both runways.|$|R
50|$|Both runway ends have <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The Cayes {{non-directional}} beacon (Ident: CAY) {{is located}} 0.4 nmi km {{southeast of the}} runway.|$|R
2500|$|The first hull {{loss of a}} 747-400 {{occurred}} on November 4, 1993 when China Airlines Flight 605, flying from Taipei to Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport, touched down more than [...] past the runway's <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold</b> during 20 knot (gusting 38) crosswinds. Combined with the disengagement of auto brakes and retracted speed brakes, manual braking and thrust reversal were not enough to prevent the aircraft from sliding into Victoria Harbour. No one was seriously injured, but the aircraft was written off. The type's second hull loss {{occurred on}} October 31, 2000, when Singapore Airlines Flight 006, a 747-400 flying on a Singapore to Los Angeles route via Taipei, rammed into construction equipment while attempting to take off from a closed runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The aircraft caught fire and was destroyed, killing 79 passengers and four crew members. The cause was attributed to the flight crew navigating to the wrong runway.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft, {{flying at}} , had been {{vectored}} by Boston's approach control to intercept the final approach course to the ILS runway 4R approach at a 45 degree angle, about [...] outside the outer marker. As {{it was later}} revealed, the controller was busy handling a potential collision conflict between two other aircraft, and therefore neglected to clear Flight 723 for the approach. The flight crew had to ask the controller for approach clearance, which was immediately given, {{but by that time}} [...] more than a minute after the intercept vector had been issued [...] they were high and fast and almost over the outer marker. The flight crew subsequently failed to stabilize the aircraft's descent rate and airspeed, descended below the glideslope and drifted away from the localizer course, hitting a seawall about [...] {{to the right of the}} extended runway centerline, about [...] short of the runway's <b>displaced</b> <b>threshold.</b> The aircraft was destroyed, killing 87 of its 89 occupants. One of the two survivors died after two hours, and the other, Leopold Chouinard, died of burn injuries on December 11, 1973; Chouinard is not listed as a Delta 723 fatality due to language in the Code of Federal Regulations that defines a fatality as taking place within 30 days of the accident.|$|E

50|$|In 2010 The Maryland Aviation Administration {{changed the}} {{criteria}} for minimum approach angles and marked the airport with new <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The thresholds shortened 1/3 of the runway for landing operations both ways on the 2,300-foot runway. Organizations that provided aircraft for Young Eagles flights have needed to relocate because the available runway was reduced beyond safe operating limits of their aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Sarov Airport (also called Mius Airfield; {{airport code}} XUDM/ЬУДМ) is an airport in Russia {{located in the}} town of Sarov, 4 km north of downtown, within the closed city area. It is a mixed use {{utilitarian}} airfield with an unusually wide runway for a small airfield of this type. The airport consists of Runway 01/19 (1920m, or 2500m including <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds)</b> without taxiways, a small apron with an adjacent car park, and a small terminal/administration building located 200 meters away from the apron.|$|R
50|$|Hudson Valley Regional Airport covers {{an area of}} 640 acre which {{contains}} three runways, {{two of which are}} paved. The main runway (6-24) is 5,001 by 100 feet (1,524 by 30 m) and is equipped with an ILS system to the northeast-facing runway along with a medium intensity approach light system with runway alignment lights. The crosswind runway (15-33) was originally 3,003 feet (915 m) long but is now shortened to 2,744 by 100 feet (836 by 30 m) due to <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds</b> at both ends. A turf/dirt runway (7-25) measures 1,358 by 100 feet (414 by 30 m).|$|R

50|$|Measuring {{threshold}} to threshold, Wellington's runway is 1815 m long; 130 m and 106 m <b>displaced</b> <b>thresholds</b> at {{the north}} (16) and south (34) ends respectively give a total runway length of 2081 m. Most large jet aircraft can safely use Wellington but the short runway severely limits their range to short-haul flights, and passenger numbers on trans-Tasman routes generally do not qualify the use of aircraft larger than the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800. Air New Zealand has occasionally used wide body aircraft to cater for high-demand events such as major sports fixtures, and the airport has seen a number of wide-body movements over the years for heads of state and visiting foreign dignitaries, diversions or special promotional events.|$|R
