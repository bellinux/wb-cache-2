40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the acute {{nature of the}} problem of <b>grand</b> business <b>corruption</b> and the major legal developments in anticorruption legislation nationally, regionally and internationally. While accepting the utility of the black letter analysis of anticorruption laws the author argues that it is equally worthwhile that legal writers establish the moral abhorrence of international corruption across human cultures and forms of civilisation. It is suggested that there is ample basis for doing so by distilling the philosophical, religious and cultural jurisprudence of corruption from the corpus of indigenous African religion, Islamic thought, Christian theology and cultural values common to human societies. It is noted that the complicity of western societies in providing home for stolen and illegal wealth systematically transferred from the developing world is at odds with this shared moral vocabulary of human civilisations. It is argued that the utility of establishing the moral imperative of the global anticorruption movement is {{to put a stop to}} this phenomenon and to ensure the expansion of the jurisprudence and international criminal jurisdiction against gross abusers on the same basis as is presently done against pirates, terrorists hijackers and other persons engaging in acts regarded as delicta jure gentium...|$|R

While resource users often knows inspectors personally – and uphold discretion necessary for bribery to continue – they depict them as dishonest and describe how corrupt acts decrease their trustworthiness. The findings from the South African case illustrate the importance of curbing both <b>grand</b> and petty <b>corruption</b> to increase the effectiveness of regulations in natural resource management. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The World Bank {{collects}} a {{range of}} data on corruption, including survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide {{and a set of}} indicators of governance and institutional quality.

[...] While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from [...] "is corruption a serious problem?" [...] to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the Millennium Challenge Corporation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{one element}} {{that appears to}} be a major cause of corruption: inadequate public regulation. Based on a simple model of the interplay between the costs of acting in accordance with government regulations for individuals or their organizations, on one side, and the capacities of those individuals or organizations to comply with the regulations, on the other side, a series of relevant aspects are identified for the design and implementation of public strategies to prevent corruption, regarding both petty <b>corruption</b> and <b>grand</b> or political <b>corruption.</b> This approach seems useful in a twofold sense. First, it calls attention to the quality of public regulation and the processes of public administration by which regulations are introduced and applied, underlining the importance to encompass these issues within public strategies aimed at the prevention of corruption. This is relevant because these issues are not explicitly recognized within the catalogue of preventive measures reflected in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and rather remain within the category of generic measures that could be utilized b...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a vast}} {{literature}} on the causes and consequences of corruption. A common theme {{is the belief that}} countries which exhibit a low level of political competition {{are more likely to have}} higher levels of corruption. The model presented here examines the effect of corruption on environmental policy under varying degrees of political competition. An important feature of this model, which has received far less attention in the literature, is that corruption may occur at different levels. A polluting firm attempts to reduce the amount of an environmental tax it pays by bribing a low level bureaucrat to make false reports regarding emission levels. In addition, it also makes contributions to the incumbent and rival parties of government in order to influence key policy parameters. The model thus provides a picture of the relationship between political competition, environmental outcomes and the type of corruption which may be observed. It is shown that higher levels of political competition result in more stringent regulations and better environmental outcomes. Political competition also has the capacity to reduce both <b>grand</b> and petty <b>corruption,</b> however...|$|R
