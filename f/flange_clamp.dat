40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{finite element}} code DYnamic Crash Analysis of STructures (DYCAST) {{was used to}} model an accident scenario that occurred at the National Transonic Facility (NTF) wind tunnel. A post mishap investigation revealed that {{a total of five}} upstream bulkhead fairing plates were missing, three in one location and two in another. These plates were drawn into the wind tunnel's composite fan blades causing extensive damage. A DYCAST model was developed to determine if one-half of a small thermal shield <b>flange</b> <b>clamp,</b> weighing approximately 2. 7 lbs., could have spun off the NTF drive shaft and impacted the bulkhead fairing plates with sufficient energy to cause failure of the attachment bolts. The clamp was presumed to have spun off at a tangent from the NTF drive shaft at a velocity of 1624 in/sec (drive shaft rotating at 580 rpm). The DYCAST analytical model predicts that impact of the 2. 7 lbs projectile failed all of the bolts in two of the fairing plates allowing them to escape from the bulkhead ring with a low velocity of a few in/sec...|$|E

40|$|EP 253181 A UPAB: 19930923 A fixture for a {{grinding}} wheel to an electric angle grinder {{is based on}} a <b>clamping</b> <b>flange</b> by which the wheel is clamped to the abutment of the hollow spindle. This flange is screwed to the threaded pin of a clamping pin. The cavity between the surfaces is filled with a plastic matrial, e. g. PVC of a low degree of polymerisation which is poured in as a liq. when hot and becomes a jelly when cold. By applying the lever on the thrust disc, the plunger is moved to displace the jelly in one of the cavities for a firm connection between for the wheel clamped between. ADVANTAGE - This relieves the <b>clamping</b> <b>flange</b> only when the grinding disc is to be changed and is ideal for one-hand grinders...|$|R

The material {{is divided into two}} sections which include: (1) data concerning a selected group of fasteners and concept for fasteners such as locking devices, couplings, and connect and release mechanisms; and (2) discussions on a number of fastening techniques such as those for mounting panel lamps, <b>clamping</b> <b>flange</b> bolts, stretching fasteners, and transferring fuel from a tanker to another vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} with a molten salt loop at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM to resolve issues associated with {{the operation of the}} 10 MW{sub e} Solar Two Central Receiver Power Plant located near Barstow, CA. The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of flanges (e. g., tapered <b>flanges</b> or <b>clamp</b> type <b>flanges)</b> hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components. In addition, the flanges were thermally shocked to simulate cold starting the system. Instrumentation such as vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters were tested alongside each other, and compared with flow measurements from calibration tanks in the flow loop...|$|R
40|$|Statement of the problem. Woodworking {{machinery}} is extensively used in {{the production}} of wood components for the construction of objects for various purpose. Operation of woodworking machinery is accompanied by high noise emissions. Circular woodworking machines are the most problematic in terms of their noise characteristics, and also most widespread. The dominating noise source is a saw disk. Results. Vibration-damping structure is suggested in the form of seals with dry friction placed be-tween <b>clamping</b> <b>flanges</b> and a saw disk. Vibration-damping properties of seals are experimentally examined using H. Oberstâ€™s method. The analysis amounted to establishing how the value of the total loss coefficient is affected by the following factors: seal foundation type, frequency of excitation, particles size (dispersion), temperature factor. Based on the obtained results, an experimental study of acoustic efficiency of vibration-damping seals with dry friction was performed, varying being such parameters as the particles size (dispersion) and seal foundation type. Conclusions. The construction of vibration-damping seals with dry friction with the appropriate particle dispersion and foundation material is {{based on the results of}} the experimental study. The suggested construction has considerable advantages over polymeric seals...|$|R
40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} twin girder overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the <b>flanges</b> as <b>clamped.</b> Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|R
