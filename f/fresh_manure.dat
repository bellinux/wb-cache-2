The tested six organic amendments were composted rice straw, <b>fresh</b> chicken <b>manure,</b> composted chicken <b>manure,</b> <b>fresh</b> pig <b>manure,</b> composted pig manure and commercial organic fertilizer. The results showed that application of all of the six organic fertilizers could obviously increase the contents of water soluble heavy metals in the soils and concentrations of heavy metals in the surface water at early stage of the experiment, as compared with the control without application of organic manure. The increase in the contents of water soluble heavy metals in the soils and concentrations of heavy metals in the field surface water were highest for <b>fresh</b> pig <b>manure,</b> followed by <b>fresh</b> chicken, and the lowest for commercial organic fertilizers. The contents of heavy metals in soils and the concentrations of heavy metals in field surface water decreased with the increase of the experimental time. The effects of applying organic fertilizer on the accumulation of heavy metals in rice grains was not obvious. Correlation analysis showed that the contents of water soluble heavy metals in soils, and concentrations of heavy metals in field surface water were all significantly correlated with the corresponding DOC concentration, suggesting that the increase of DOC could promote the activation of heavy metals in soils. The difference in the activity of heavy metals in soils added with different organic amendments might be due to the difference in the degree of decomposition and release DOC capacity of the added organic amendments. But the research also showed that the soil DOC decreased gradually with the increasing time of organic fertilizer application. Therefore, the activation of heavy metals in farmland soils caused by organic manure was temporary, and the accumulation of heavy metals in the grain during the late rice growth was not obvious...|$|R

Labeling soil-available P also allowed assessing the uptake from residual P that remained in the soils because of their different fertilization histories. On each soil, recovery of <b>fresh</b> <b>manure</b> P in four harvests of ryegrass shoots was lower than recovery of mineral P.

However, the nutrient relationship among fodder, manure, and farm yard manure has not been clearly understood. In addition, the monetary value of the nutrient of FYM has not been quantified.

Additionally, it analyses the nutrient composition (NPK) of the manure of five goats, cows and buffalo feeding on three types of fodder species over a 27 day cycle. Finally, it calculates the monetary value of the nutrients in both fodder and manure. The nutrient content of each fodder species is different for each village and according to livestock type.

Anaerobic digestion has become an increasingly popular manure management option because it generates methane {{that can be used}} to make energy, but little is known about the behavior of P when digested manure is applied to fields. Leaching experiments were performed using simulated rainfall on digester influent (undigested manure) and effluent (digested manure) collected from a dairy farm near Ithaca, NY. A previously published manure-P model was applied to the experimental data to quantify rates of P leaching.

Interestingly, both digester influent and effluent leached dissolved P more rapidly and in greater quantities than <b>fresh</b> <b>manure,</b> i. e., manure from a dairy barn floor. It is suggested that the key difference between the liquid manures in this study and "fresh manure" is that <b>fresh</b> <b>manure</b> has a higher solids content, i. e., it is less liquid than the manure used in anaerobic digesters.

40|$|Concentrations {{of human}} {{health-related}} microorganisms in runoff from agricultural plots (0. 75 m x 2 m) treated with fresh and aged cattle manure, swine slurry and no manure (control) were determined. Three consecutive simulated rainfall events, producing 35 mm rainfall and separated by 24 h, {{were carried out}} for each plot. Fecal indicator (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and coliphage) loads released in rainfall runoff from plots treated with <b>fresh</b> cattle <b>manure,</b> aged cattle manure and swine slurry treatments ranged from 5. 52 x 105 to 4. 36 x 109, 3. 92 x 104 to 4. 86 x 108, and 9. 63 x 105 to 3. 05 x 108, respectively. Plot runoff concentrations of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts) ranged from 1. 65 x 105 to 1. 04 x 106, 2. 93 x 103 to 2. 75 x 105, and 9. 12 x 104 to 3. 58 x 106 for <b>fresh</b> cattle <b>manure,</b> aged cattle manure and swine slurry plot treatments, respectively. These results suggest that large microbial loads could be released via heavy precipitation events that produce runoff from livestock manure-applied agricultural fields, of even modest size, and could {{have a significant impact}} on water bodies within the watershed. Because of the lack of multiplication in the environment, highly elevated concentrations in manured land runoff, and correlation to protozoan parasite presence, Clostridium may be an alternative indicator for livestock manure contamination...|$|R
