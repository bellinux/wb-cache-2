The N-terminal {{regions of}} both forms of MAO contain an ADP-binding consensus sequence found in several dinucleotide-dependent enzymes, but otherwise show remarkable sequence differences. In order {{to investigate whether}} the N-terminal region of MAOs participates in the different catalytic properties and inhibitor specificities exhibited by MAO-A and MAO-B, we constructed chimeric A/B forms and expressed them in a human embryonic kidney cell line (293 cells). The MAO-A chimeric form containing the N-terminus (36 amino acids) of MAO-B and the B chimera having the first 45 amino acid sequence of MAO-A were both catalytically active. Compared to the respective wild-type form, they did not show any significant difference in their catalytic properties (Km, kcat) towards the substrates tested or in their sensitivity towards inhibitors.

The detailed study of the folding dynamics of protein-like sequences designed as to exhibit different contact energy distributions, as well as different degrees of sequence optimization (i. e., participation of non-native interactions in the folding process), reveals significant differences in the corresponding locking scenarios—the collection of native contacts and their average locking times, which are largely ascribable to the dynamics of non-native contacts. Furthermore, strong evidence for a positive role played by non-native contacts at an early folding stage was also found. Interestingly, for topologically simple target structures, a positive interplay between native and non-native contacts is observed also toward the end of the folding process, suggesting that non-native contacts may indeed affect the overall folding process. For target models exhibiting clear two-state kinetics, the relation between the nucleation mechanism of folding and the locking scenario is investigated. Our results suggest that the stabilization of the folding transition state can be achieved through the establishment of a very small network of native contacts that are the first to lock during the folding process...|$|R

However, the sludge commonly contains high amounts of human pathogenic bacteria excreted in faeces and urine. To use sludge as fertilizer on food producing land is therefore a controversial issue, partly because of the risk of spreading disease-causing pathogens. The Swedish environment protection agency (SEPA) pre-approved two hygenization methods for the treatment of the sludge due to their positive effects on the sludge quality. One of them, conventional pasteurization (70 °C, 1 h), was investigated for its feasibility in Uppsala, Sweden, and {{it was found that the}} heat consumption was very high. The other method has the advantage of potentially increase the produced biogas. This hygenization method has been investigated in the present study through a pilot experiment where thickened mesophilic digested sludge is digested once more at thermophilic conditions (55 °C). The aim of the study was to investigate the possibility to develop this self-sufficient (in heat and electricity) hygenization method. The results showed an increase in the gas production from 430 dm 3 /kg VSin to 610 dm 3 /kg VSin by adding the thermophilic step. This increase gave an energy balance with an excess of both heat and electricity.

C. del Río) : e-mail: delrio@irnase. csic. esA set of {{impurities}} (specks) {{occurring in}} a TCF (Totally chlorine free) -bleached Kraft pulp of Eucalyptus globulus wood was studied. The impurities were Soxhlet extracted with acetone, and the extracts subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using high temperature capillary columns. The lipophilic fraction isolated from E. globulus wood extractives was also analyzed for comparison. The {{composition of the}} acetone extracts was {{very similar to that}} of E. globulus wood. Fatty acids, steroid hydrocarbons, sterols, steroid ketones and sterol esters, arising from E. globulus wood extractives survived the cooking and bleaching processes and accumulated in the pulp. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>residue</b> left after <b>acetone</b> extraction was studied by pyrolysis-GC-MS. The results indicated that it was composed of small particles of polyisoprene rubber. In conclusion, the speck impurities studied here seems to be composed of two different moieties, a lipophilic part arising from wood extractives and a core of small particles of synthetic polymers (polyisoprene rubber).

40|$|Summary: LogoBar is a Java {{application}} to display protein sequence logos. In our software gaps are accounted for when calculating the information content present at each residue {{position in a}} multiple alignment. The resulting logo is displayed as a graph consisting of bars, although traditional letter representation is also possible. Amino acids are displayed {{from the bottom up}} with decreasing frequencies i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> most abundant <b>residue</b> is placed {{at the bottom of the}} logo. The bars can be color-coded according to user specifications. Gaps in the alignment are also displayed, either on top or at the bottom of <b>the</b> logo. Furthermore, <b>residues</b> can either be arranged according to their relative abundance or grouped according to user criteria to emphasize the conserved nature of particular positions. Availability: LogoBar and further documentation is available a...|$|R

Indeed, progressive distillation can produce a residue as rich in X as is required.|$|R

The effect of bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on the different reactions involved in the dolichol pathway has been studied. Although dolichyl phosphate mannose, dolichyl phosphate glucose and dolichyl diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine synthesis is not affected at all by bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (20 mM), this product inhibits completely the addition of <b>the</b> second N-acetylglucosamine <b>residue</b> on <b>the</b> dolichyl diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine acceptor. The addition of the five innermost mannose residues from GDP-mannose as donor is also strongly abolished. However, the addition of the more distal sugars, i. <b>e.</b> <b>the</b> four mannose <b>residues</b> using dolichyl phosphate mannose as donors and <b>the</b> additional glucose <b>residues</b> are only slightly affected. The reactions involved in the utilization of dolichyl diphosphate oligosaccharide, i. <b>e.</b> transfer to <b>the</b> proteins or degradation into soluble phospho-oligosaccharides, are also strongly inhibited. Thus bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate appears to affect only the reactions involving the presence of dolichyl diphosphate sugar as substrate...|$|R
