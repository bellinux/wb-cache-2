5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} {{traditions are}} clear influences on The Age of Reason, Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> {{for the use of}} reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in The Age of Reason, albeit less coherently.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.|$|E
50|$|George Knight <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{for some}} {{structural}} change. Raymond Cottrell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{for an independent}} North American Division.|$|R
50|$|He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{before the}} Supreme Court of the United States twice and <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> before {{most of the}} federal courts of appeals.|$|R
5000|$|Manfred Nowak <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> the {{opposite}} position, {{that the right}} of return applies [...] "even if masses of people are claiming this right" [...] Bracka <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> similarly: ...|$|R
5|$|All {{the tissues}} are in Aristotle's view {{completely}} uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example {{was the same}} all the way through, not subdivided into atoms as Democritus (c. 460–c. 370 BC) <b>had</b> <b>argued.</b> The uniform parts can be arranged {{on a scale of}} Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as hair, to the hottest and wettest, such as milk.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was a doctor of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be}} considered a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
50|$|Jouko Väänänen <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> for second-order logic as a {{foundation}} for mathematics instead of set theory, whereas others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> for category theory as {{a foundation}} for certain aspects of mathematics.|$|R
2500|$|Robert Birrell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that {{immigration}} is creating social divisions and risks long-term national unity. Anthropologist and ethologist Frank Salter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that immigration}} is creating [...] "ethnic stratification" [...] in Australian society.|$|R
50|$|Bergmann {{has made}} two main {{contributions}} to economics. First, she <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that discrimination is a pervasive characteristic of labor markets. Second, she <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> against the traditional economic methodology of drawing conclusions from {{a set of}} unrealistic assumptions.|$|R
5|$|Baby becomes {{involved}} in a trivial argument with a loafer in {{the centre of the}} village. The dispute escalates, but passersby calm them down. However, Crispin appears and attacks the man who <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> with Baby. The man, joined by Jimson Augustine, jumps on Crispin in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jimson, furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jimson and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E
5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that they had taken their dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but no records of this could be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and Marten <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hans Turnwald is {{not listed}} by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). According to Veit Scherzer, on 8 May 1945, Turnwald, as Leutnant of the Reserves {{and leader of}} Jagdpanzer-Kompanie 1015, had been {{nominated}} for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The nomination of the Heerespersonalamt (HPA—Army Personnel Office) was ready for signature but the process was never completed. In similar instances the AKCR <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that the presentation was {{in accordance with the}} Dönitz-decree. This is illegal according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) and lacks legal justification. Scherzer claims that the AKCR forgot to list him.|$|E
5000|$|American generals <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{that these}} raids are a [...] "critical" [...] part of {{achieving}} {{success in the}} war. Afghani president Hamid Karzai <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that they impinge upon Afghanistan's sovereignty and has called {{for them to be}} halted.|$|R
50|$|Many {{scholarly}} and popular interpreters <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that a prophecy {{may have a}} dual fulfillment; others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{for the possibility of}} multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.|$|R
50|$|Lax <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that Finland {{would be}} better off if it sought {{membership}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the time is now, and the option would not be available if the current peaceful situation changed.|$|R
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong <b>had</b> <b>argued,</b> {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|Most of the book's {{scientific}} chapters {{were reviewed}} by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring {{to many of}} the delegates, and promoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).|$|E
5|$|Moxon {{represented}} manager Ken Hoden of the Church of Scientology's Golden Era Productions in February 1998 when {{he filed}} {{a restraining order}} against Keith Henson after Henson protested against Scientology in May 1997 and January 1998 outside the Golden Era film studios in Gilman Hot Springs, California. Moxon <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge in the fields of cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the restraining order permanent.|$|E
50|$|Some writers <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that {{philosophers}} such as Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Ferdinand de Saussure have promoted phonocentric views. Walter Ong, who {{has also}} expressed support {{for the idea of}} phonocentrism, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the culture of the United States is particularly non-phonocentric.|$|R
50|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{that governments}} treated this crisis {{as one of}} {{investor}} confidence rather than deeply indebted institutions unable to lend, delaying the appropriate remedies. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that this crisis represents a reset of economic activity, rather than a recession or cyclical downturn.|$|R
50|$|Unfair {{dismissal}} is now {{governed by}} the Labour Relations Act. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.|$|R
5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other major}} feuds were also {{highlighted}} at this event. Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match to resolve an angle {{in which the}} two <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> over the rightful holder of the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Bam Bam Bigelow gained revenge against Doink the Clown, with whom he had been feuding, by teaming with Luna Vachon to defeat Doink and his partner Dink. Randy Savage also settled his feud with Crush by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics of}} the {{scientific}} consensus on global warming <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an unjustified ad hominem attack. Political scientist Roger Pielke, Jr., responding to Mooney, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that science is inevitably intertwined with politics.|$|R
5000|$|Schluter has founded two organisations which {{research}} relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. Schluter {{has also}} written several books on the subject. Schluter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that modern society takes very little account of relationships and <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the prevailing understanding of Capitalism in the West has [...] "built within it a framework of thinking that says {{the growth of the}} capital is more important than relationships." [...] He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that instead,society should focus on the importance of relationships whether that is in education or in companies.|$|R
5000|$|Menghetti-Dempsey <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{before the}} Court of International Trade ...|$|R
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{obsession}} {{led him to}} {{deny that}} animals could be colored for other reasons: for protection by mimicry, as the naturalist Henry Walter Bates had proposed, supported by many examples of butterflies from South America; through sexual selection, as Charles Darwin <b>had</b> <b>argued,</b> again supported by many observations. The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E
50|$|Scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{about the}} {{original}} function of this ivory, {{whether it was}} the tip of a scepter, or the grip on the lid of a casket containing a crown. However, recent scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the ivory was in fact a ceremonial comb made probably for the Emperor Leo VI.|$|R
50|$|Halligan <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{four cases}} before the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|R
