In general, we show that our space is metrizable and has a countable basis of clopen sets. We show that for a large class of ultragraphs the basis elements of the topology are compact. We examine shift morphisms between these shift spaces, and, for the locally compact case, show that if two (possibly infinite) ultragraphs have edge shifts that are conjugate, via a conjugacy that preserves length, then the associated ultragraph C*-algebras are isomorphic.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss strong shift equivalence, {{which has}} been used to {{characterize}} conjugacy of <b>edge</b> <b>shifts,</b> and its application to C ∗-algebras of graphs and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. 1. Background and Motivation: <b>Edge</b> <b>Shifts</b> of Finite Graphs A directed graph (hereafter simply called a graph) is a quadruple E = (E 0,E 1,r,s) consisting of a countable set of vertices E 0, a countable set of edges E 1, and functions r: E 1 → E 0 and s: E 1 → E 0 identifying the range and source of each edge. We say a graph is finite if E 0 and E 1 are finite sets. If E is a finite graph, then one may create a (two-sided) shift space XE with shift map σE: XE → XE defined by XE: = {(ei) i∈Z: ei ∈ E 1 for all i ∈ Z and r(ei) = s(ei+ 1) } and σE((ei) i∈Z) = (ei+ 1) i∈Z. The shift spaces that arise in this way are called <b>edge</b> <b>shifts.</b> We refer the reader to [12] for more about <b>shift</b> spaces and <b>edge</b> <b>shifts.</b> For a given graph E, the vertex matrix AE is the non-negative E 0 × E 0 matrix defined by AE(v,w) = #{e ∈ E 1 : s(e) = v and r(e) = w}. Definition 1. 1. Let A and B be finite, square, non-negative, integer matrices. We say that A and B are elementary strong shift equivalent if there exist non-negative, integer matrices R and S such that A = RS and B = SR. (Note that A and B need not have the same size.) Elementary strong shift equivalence is a relation that is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. Therefore, we consider the equivalence relation it generates: Definition 1. 2. We say that two finite, square, non-negative, integer matrices A and B are strong shift equivalent if there exists a finite sequenc...|$|R

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>shift</b> {{distance}} between isomorphism classes of graphs, introduced by M. Johnson, is investigated {{in the case}} of trees and compared with other distances. Various distances between isomorphism classes of graphs were studied by various authors. The author of this paper has introduced the distance based on common subgraphs [4] and on common subtrees [5]. The edge distance was introduced by V. Bal'az, J. Koca, V. Kvasnicka and M. Sekanina [1] and has found applications in the organic chemistry. The edge rotation distance was defined by G. Chartrand, F. Saba and H. -B. Zou [2]. The <b>edge</b> <b>shift</b> distance was introduced by M. Johnson [3] and is closely related to the edge rotation distance. We consider finite undirected graphs without loops and multiple edges. Let G be a finite undirected graph.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the {{complete}} design and architectural details of MAIZEROUTER. MAIZEROUTER reflects a significant leap in progress over existing publicly available rout-ing tools yet relies upon relatively simple operations, including extreme <b>edge</b> <b>shifting,</b> a technique aimed primarily at the efficient reduction of routing congestion, and edge retraction, a counter-part to extreme <b>edge</b> <b>shifting</b> that serves to reduce unnecessary wirelength. We present enhanced variations of these operations {{to enable the}} rapid exploration of candidate paths, along with a form of dynamic cost deflation that provides our various path computation procedures with progressively more accurate (and less optimistic) cost information as search continues. These al-gorithmic contributions are built upon a framework of interde-pendent net decomposition, a representation that improves upon traditional two-pin net decomposition by preventing duplication of routing resources while enabling cheap and incremental topolog-ical reconstruction. Collectively, these operations permit a broad search space that previous algorithms {{have been unable to}} achieve, resulting in solutions of considerably higher quality than those of well-established routers.

30|$|In conclusion, highly transparent, {{conductive}} ZnO:Co and ZnO:In {{thin films}} have been deposited on glass substrate by ultrasonic spray at a substrate temperature of 350 °C. The crystalline structure, conductivity, and optical properties were investigated. All the films are polycrystalline structure wurtzite with (002) preferential orientation and, thus, are {{favorable to the}} diffusion of atoms absorbed on the substrate. The maximum values of crystallite size G = 33.28, 55.46, and 45.78 nm are attained in ZnO, ZnO:Co, and ZnO:In films at concentrations of 0, 2, and 3 wt.%, respectively. The absorption <b>edge</b> <b>shifts</b> in ZnO:Co thin films are better than in ZnO:In. We found that the values of absorption <b>edge</b> <b>shifts</b> are decreased and increased with the increasing doping level, which shows that the optical band gap of the ZnO:Co films is broadened after doping with cobalt from 3.25 to 3.36 eV and the optical band gap of the ZnO:In films is narrowed after doping with indium from 3.25 to 3.18 eV. The electrical conductivity of doped films is stabilized after doping with cobalt and indium. Transparent, conductive C-doped ZnO thin films deposited by ultrasonic spray technique are of good quality. The amount of doping concentration is 2 wt.% Co and 3 wt.% In, in ZnO thin films.|$|R
