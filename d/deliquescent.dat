5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble <b>deliquescent</b> compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not <b>deliquescent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat <b>deliquescent</b> gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is <b>deliquescent,</b> forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not <b>deliquescent.</b> Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E

25|$|Thioresorcinol is {{obtained}} {{by the action of}} zinc and hydrochloric acid on the chloride of benzene meta-disulfonic acid. It melts at 27°C and boils at 243°C. Resorcinol disulfonic acid, (HO)2C6H2(HSO3)2, is a <b>deliquescent</b> mass {{obtained by the}} action of sulfuric acid on resorcin. It is readily soluble in water and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the gas {{processing}} plant is to remove water vapor from the gas using either the regenerable absorption in liquid triethylene glycol (TEG), commonly referred to as glycol dehydration, <b>deliquescent</b> chloride desiccants, and or a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit which is regenerable adsorption using a solid adsorbent. Other newer processes like membranes may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} is {{the name}} of chemical compounds with the formula ZnCl2 and its hydrates. Zinc chlorides, of which nine crystalline forms are known, are colorless or white, and are highly soluble in water. ZnCl2 itself is hygroscopic and even <b>deliquescent.</b> Samples should therefore be protected from sources of moisture, including the water vapor present in ambient air. Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, and chemical synthesis. No mineral with this chemical composition is known aside from the very rare mineral simonkolleite, Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O.|$|E
500|$|The {{thermally}} {{unstable and}} very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is the anhydride of nitric acid, {{and can be}} made from it by dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide. It is of interest for the preparation of explosives. It is a <b>deliquescent,</b> colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure +−; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O2N–O–NO2. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid (HOONO2). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The cap of {{the fruit}} bodies is {{initially}} egg-shaped, then conical to convex before flattening out, reaching diameters between [...] It has deep narrow grooves reaching almost {{as far as the}} center of the cap. The surface color is a pale buff, tawny or cinnamon towards the center, but the color loses intensity when the mushroom is dry. The flesh is whitish, thin, fragile and barely <b>deliquescent</b> (auto-digesting). The gills are initially buff, then turn grayish brown. They are either free from attachment to the stem, or adnexed, meaning {{only a small portion of}} the gill is attached. The stem is whitish, very slender, and more or less equal in width throughout its length, or slightly thicker at the base; its dimensions are [...] by [...] thick. The stem surface of young specimens are pruinose—appearing to be coated with a minute layer of fine white particles; this eventually is sloughed off, leaving a smooth or silky surface. The odor and taste {{of the fruit}} bodies are not distinctive. The gills of this species do not autodigest with age, or barely do so; the fruit bodies tend to become more fragile with age.|$|E
2500|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} {{is one of}} many substances {{used for}} dust control, soil stabilization and wind erosion mitigation. When magnesium chloride is applied to roads and bare soil areas, both positive and negative performance issues occur which are related to many application factors.

2500|$|Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is {{a common}} {{inorganic}} chemical reagent, most commonly used as an oxidizing agent in various laboratory and industrial applications. As with all hexavalent chromium compounds, it is acutely and chronically harmful to health. It is a crystalline ionic solid with a very bright, red-orange color. [...] The salt is popular in the laboratory {{because it is not}} <b>deliquescent,</b> in contrast to the more industrially relevant salt sodium dichromate.|$|E
2500|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of both CoCl2 and the hydrate {{contain the}} species 2+. [...] They also contain chloride ions. [...] In the solid state CoCl2·6H2O {{consists of the}} molecule trans- and two molecules of water of crystallization. This species dissolves readily in water and alcohol. Concentrated aqueous solutions are red at room temperature but become blue at higher temperatures. CoCl2·6H2O is <b>deliquescent,</b> and the anhydrous salt CoCl2 is hygroscopic, readily converting to the hydrate.|$|E
2500|$|Nickel(II) {{chloride}} (or just nickel chloride), is {{the chemical}} compound NiCl2. The anhydrous salt is yellow, {{but the more}} familiar hydrate NiCl2·6H2O is green. Nickel(II) chloride, in various forms, {{is the most important}} source of nickel for chemical synthesis. [...] The nickel chlorides are <b>deliquescent,</b> absorbing moisture from the air to form a solution. [...] Nickel salts {{have been shown to be}} carcinogenic to the lungs and nasal passages, in cases of long-term inhalation exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Like many {{platinum}} compounds, {{chloroplatinic acid}} {{is used in}} catalysis. This compound was first reported by John Speier and colleagues from Dow Corning Corporation to catalyze the addition of silyl hydrides to olefins, hydrosilylation. [...] Early test reactions used isopropanol solutions of trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) with pentenes. Prior work on the addition of silanes to alkenes required radical reactions that were inefficient. As well as with Karstedt's catalyst, Speier's catalyst enjoys widespread use for hydrosilylation, the main drawback is the <b>deliquescent</b> properties of the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium {{chloride}} {{is used as}} {{a relative}} humidity standard in the calibration of hygrometers. [...] At [...] a saturated solution (45.8%) of the salt will yield an equilibrium relative humidity of 11.30%. Additionally, lithium chloride can itself be used as a hygrometer. This <b>deliquescent</b> salt forms a self-solution when exposed to air. [...] The equilibrium LiCl concentration in the resulting solution {{is directly related to the}} relative humidity of the air. The percent relative humidity at [...] can be estimated, with minimal error in the range , from the following first order equation: RH=107.93-2.11C, where C is solution LiCl concentration, percent by mass.|$|E
60|$|We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to point out and consider certain general ways in which the various factors and elements in the <b>deliquescent</b> society of the present time will react one upon another, and to speculate what definite statements, if any, it may seem reasonable to make about the individual people of the year 2000--or thereabouts--from the reaction of these classes we have attempted to define.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Reeks has {{analysed}} for {{me some of}} the salt from the salina near the Rio Negro; he finds it composed entirely of chloride of sodium, with the exception of 0.26 of sulphate of lime and of 0.22 of earthy matter: there are no traces of iodic salts. Some salt from the salina Chiquitos, in the Pampean formation, is equally pure. It is a singular fact, that the salt from these salinas does not serve so well for preserving meat, as sea-salt from the Cape de Verde Islands; and a merchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as 50 per cent less valuable. The purity of the Patagonian salt, or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all sea- water, is the only assignable cause for this inferiority; a conclusion which is supported by the fact lately ascertained, that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the <b>deliquescent</b> chlorides. ("Horticultural and Agricultural Gazette" [...] 1845 page 93.) (It would probably well answer for the merchants of Buenos Ayres (considering the great consumption there of salt for preserving meat) to import the <b>deliquescent</b> chlorides to mix with the salt from the salinas: I may call attention to the fact, that at Iquique, a large quantity of muriate of lime, left in the MOTHER-WATER during the refinement of the nitrate of soda, is annually thrown away.) ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} horrible doubts troubled Mr. Hoopdriver. Had that {{handkerchief}} been a dream? Besides {{which he was}} <b>deliquescent</b> and scarlet, and felt so. It must be her coquetry--the handkerchief was indisputable. Should he ride {{up to her and}} get off, or get off and ride up to her? It was as well she didn't look, because he would certainly capsize if he lifted his cap. Perhaps that was her consideration. Even as he hesitated he was upon her. She must have heard his breathing. He gripped the brake. Steady! His right leg waved in the air, and he came down heavily and staggering, but erect. She turned her eyes upon him with admirable surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "The bicycle for boys, George--or fools. The {{things will}} {{not keep up}} for a moment without you work at them, they need {{constant}} attention; I would as soon ride a treadmill. You cannot loaf with them, and the only true pleasure of cycling is to loaf. Yet only this morning did I meet an elderly gentleman with a beard fit for Abraham, his face all crimson and <b>deliquescent</b> with heat, and all distorted with the fury of his haste, toiling up a hill {{on one of these}} unstable instruments. When he saw me coming down in all my ease and dignity he damned at me with his bell. Now, I do not like to see a bicycle wobble under a load of years, and steer into the irascible. As years increase tempers shorten, and bicycles, even the best of bicycles, are seductively irritating.|$|E
60|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{live like}} {{persons on board}} a ship: every necessary comes from a distance: water is brought in boats from Pisagua, about forty miles northward, and is sold {{at the rate of}} nine reals (four shillings and sixpence) an eighteen-gallon cask: I bought a wine-bottle full for threepence. In like manner firewood, and of course every article of food, is imported. Very few animals can be maintained in such a place: on the ensuing morning I hired with difficulty, at the price of four pounds sterling, two mules and a guide {{to take me to the}} nitrate of soda works. These are at present the support of Iquique. This salt was first exported in 1830: in one year an amount in value of one hundred thousand pounds sterling was sent to France and England. It is principally used as a manure and in the manufacture of nitric acid: owing to its <b>deliquescent</b> property it will not serve for gunpowder. Formerly there were two exceedingly rich silver-mines in this neighbourhood, but their produce is now very small.|$|E
60|$|Wilkins, {{with his}} little pile of books for reference, his sombre manner, and his persistence, was indeed curiously suggestive of an {{advocate}} opening a trial. The Mind of the Race was far less of a continuity {{than it was when}} a generally recognized and understood orthodox Christianity held it together, as a backbone holds together the ribs and limbs and head of a body. That manifestly was what he was driving at, as Dodd presently complained. In those stabler days every one with ideas, willingly or unwillingly, had to refer to that doctrinal core, had to link up to it even if the connection was used only as a point of departure. Now more and more, as in these three examples, people began irresponsibly in the air, with rash assertions about life and race and the tendency of things. And the louder they shouted, the more fantastic and remarkable they were, the more likely they were to gather a following and establish a fresh vortex in the <b>deliquescent</b> confusion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{season for}} working the salinas forms {{the harvest of}} Patagones; for on it the {{prosperity}} of the place depends. Nearly the whole population encamps {{on the bank of}} the river, and the people are employed in drawing out the salt in bullock-waggons. This salt is crystallised in great cubes, and is remarkably pure: Mr. Trenham Reeks has kindly analysed some for me, and he finds in it only 0.26 of gypsum and 0.22 of earthy matter. It is a singular fact that it does not serve so well for preserving meat as sea-salt from the Cape de Verd islands; and a merchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per cent less valuable. Hence the Cape de Verd salt is constantly imported, and is mixed with that from these salinas. The purity of the Patagonian salt, or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all sea-water, is the only assignable cause for this inferiority: a conclusion which no one, I think, would have suspected, but which is supported by the fact lately ascertained, that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the <b>deliquescent</b> chlorides.

6000|$|Of {{all this}} sentimental and <b>deliquescent</b> Puritanism Bernard Shaw {{has always been}} the antagonist; and the only respect in which it has soiled him was that he {{believed}} for only too long that such sloppy idealism was the whole idealism of Christendom and so used [...] "idealist" [...] itself as a term of reproach. But there were other and negative effects of Puritanism which he did not escape so completely. I cannot think that he has wholly escaped that element in Puritanism which may fairly bear the title of the taboo. For it is a singular fact that although extreme Protestantism is dying in elaborate and over-refined civilisation, yet it is the barbaric patches of it that live longest and die last. Of the creed of John Knox the modern Protestant has abandoned the civilised part and retained only the savage part. He has given up that great and systematic philosophy of Calvinism which had much in common with modern science and strongly resembles ordinary and recurrent determinism. But he has retained the accidental veto upon cards or comic plays, which Knox only valued as mere proof of his people's concentration on their theology. All the awful but sublime affirmations of Puritan theology are gone. Only savage negations remain; such as that by which in Scotland on every seventh day the creed of fear lays his finger on all hearts and makes an evil silence in the streets.|$|E
60|$|It will {{be obvious}} that the {{interest}} of this speculation, at any rate, centres upon this great intermediate mass {{of people who are}} neither passively wealthy, the sleeping partners of change, nor helplessly thrust out of the process. Indeed, from our point of view--an inquiry into coming things--these non-effective masses would have but the slightest interest were it not for their enormous possibilities of reaction upon the really living portion of the social organism. This really living portion seems at first sight to be as <b>deliquescent</b> in its nature, to be drifting down to as chaotic a structure as either the non-functional owners that float above it or the unemployed who sink below. What were once the definite subdivisions of the middle class modify and lose their boundaries. The retail tradesman of the towns, for example--once a fairly homogeneous class throughout Europe--expands here into vast store companies, and dwindles there to be an agent or collector, seeks employment or topples outright into the abyss. But under a certain scrutiny one can detect here what we do not detect in our other two elements, and that is that, going on {{side by side with the}} processes of dissolution and frequently masked by these, there are other processes by which men, often of the most diverse parentage and antecedent traditions, are being segregated into a multitude of specific new groups which may presently develop very distinctive characters and ideals.|$|E
6000|$|But this {{impending}} {{dissolution of}} a common standard of morals does not mean universal depravity until some great reconstruction obtains {{any more than the}} obsolescence of the Conventicle Act means universal irreligion. It means that for one Morality there will be many moralities. Each human being will, in the face of circumstances, work out his or her particular early training as his or her character determines. And although there will be a general convention upon which the most diverse people will meet, it will only be with persons who have come to identical or similar conclusions in the matter of moral conduct and who are living in similar ménages, just as now it is only with people whose conversation implies a certain community or kinship of religious belief, that really frequent and intimate intercourse will go on. In other words, there will be a process of moral segregation[31] set up. Indeed, such a process is probably already in operation, amidst the <b>deliquescent</b> social mass. People will be drawn together into little groups of similar ménages having much in common. And this--in view of the considerations advanced in the first two chapters, considerations all converging on the practical abolition of distances and the general freedom of people to live anywhere they like over large areas--will mean very frequently an actual local segregation. There will be districts that will be clearly recognized and marked as [...] "nice," [...] fast regions, areas of ramshackle Bohemianism, regions of earnest and active work, old-fashioned corners and Hill Tops. Whole regions will be set aside for the purposes of opulent enjoyment--a thing already happening, indeed, at points along the Riviera to-day. Already the superficial possibilities of such a segregation have been glanced at. It has been pointed out that the enormous urban region of the future may present an extraordinary variety of districts, suburbs, and subordinate centres within its limiting boundaries, and here we have a very definite enforcement of that probability.|$|E
6000|$|The {{safe life}} in the old order, where one did this because it was right, and that {{because it was the}} custom, when one shunned this and hated that, as lead runs into a mould, all that is passing away. And presently, as the new century opens out, there will become more and more {{distinctly}} emergent many new cultures and settled ways. The grey expanse of life to-day is grey, not in its essence, but because of the minute confused mingling and mutual cancelling of many-coloured lives. Presently these tints and shades will gather together here as a mass of one colour, and there as a mass of another. And as these colours intensify and the tradition of the former order fades, as these cultures become more and more shaped and conscious, as the new literatures grow in substance and power, as differences develop from speculative matter of opinion to definite intentions, as contrasts and affinities grow sharper and clearer, there must follow some very extensive modifications in the collective public life. But one series of tints, one colour must needs have a heightening value amidst this iridescent display. While the forces at work in the wealthy and purely speculative groups of society make for disintegration, and in many cases for positive elimination, the forces that bring together the really functional people will tend more and more to impose upon them certain common characteristics and beliefs, and the discovery of a group of similar and compatible class interests upon which they can unite. The practical people, the engineering and medical and scientific people, will become more and more homogeneous in their fundamental culture, more and more distinctly aware of a common [...] "general reason" [...] in things, and of a common difference from the less functional masses and from any sort of people in the past. They will have in their positive science a common ground for understanding the real pride of life, the real reason for the incidental nastiness of vice, and so they will be a sanely reproductive class, and, above all, an educating class. Just how much they will have kept or changed of the <b>deliquescent</b> morality of to-day, when in a hundred years or so they do distinctively and powerfully emerge, I cannot speculate now. They will certainly be a moral people. They will have developed the literature of their needs, they will have discussed and tested and thrashed out many things, they will be clear where we are confused, resolved where we are undecided and weak. In the districts of industrial possibility, in the healthier quarters of the town regions, away from the swamps and away from the glare of the midnight lights, these people will be gathered together. They will be linked in professions through the agency of great and sober papers--in England the Lancet, the British Medical Journal, and the already great periodicals of the engineering trades, foreshadow something, but only a very little, of what these papers may be. The best of the wealthy will gravitate to their attracting centres.... Unless some great catastrophe in nature break down all that man has built, these great kindred groups of capable men and educated, adequate women must be, under the operation of the forces we have considered so far, the element finally emergent amidst the vast confusions of the coming time.|$|E
