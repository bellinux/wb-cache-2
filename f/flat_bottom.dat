25|$|A {{precursor}} to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River. The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> of the bateau resulted in {{the birth of the}} dory. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that could reasonably be construed as predecessors of the Dory.|$|E
25|$|An {{oyster reef}} can {{increase}} the surface area of a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> 50-fold. An oyster's mature shape often depends {{on the type of}} bottom to which it is originally attached, but it always orients itself with its outer, flared shell tilted upward. One valve is cupped and the other is flat.|$|E
25|$|Sheet pans, cookie sheets, and Swiss roll tins are {{bakeware}} {{with large}} <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Premier Grade - two-piece, hollow body, <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> glass eyes, swirl {{paint on}} breast, notch carved bill, carved nostrils, carved nail.|$|R
5000|$|A galiot was {{a type of}} Dutch or German 20 to 400 GRT trade ship, {{similar to}} a ketch, with a rounded fore and aft like a fluyt. They had nearly <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> to sail in shallow waters. These ships were {{especially}} favored for coastal navigation in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. To avoid excessive leeway, or leeward drift due to their <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> smaller vessels were usually fitted with leeboards. After 1830, a modernised type of galiot was developed that featured a sharper bow similar to a schooner. These vessels rarely had leeboards.|$|R
25|$|Coracles {{are light}} boats {{shaped like a}} bowl, {{typically}} with a frame of woven grass or reeds, or strong saplings covered with animal hides. The keel-less, <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> evenly spreads the weight across the structure reducing the required depth of water often to only a few inches. Coracles have been used, and to a degree are still used, in India, Vietnam, Iraq, Tibet, North America and Britain.|$|E
25|$|On lap 35, Coulthard passed Irvine, {{who then}} retired on lap 41 with three laps to go, with an {{alternator}} failure. Schumacher took the chequered flag, but was disqualified {{after the race}} because the wooden stepped <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> board on Schumacher's car had been excessively worn away, more than the permitted 10% wear. Hill was reclassified as the winner ahead of Häkkinen, Verstappen, Coulthard, Blundell and Morbidelli.|$|E
25|$|CHANTs were {{designed}} with a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> {{to enable them}} to ground on beaches. A double hull was used to minimise any chance of leakage. Each CHANT had four sub-divided tanks and was fitted with one single mast with two derricks and winches. They were not the most stable of ships, and needed to carry plenty of ballast. CHANTs were assembled at five different shipyards, and launched between February and May 1944.|$|E
50|$|Challenge - both {{one piece}} solid and two-piece hollow bodies, <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> glass eyes, less {{elaborate}} paint on breast, no notch carved bill, lesser carved nostrils, painted black nail.|$|R
50|$|Hillcrest Wildlife Management Area {{is located}} in Hancock County near New Cumberland, West Virginia. Located on 2212 acre of former farmland, the <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> and rolling hills provide open fields, old {{orchards}} and small forest lots.|$|R
30|$|The 1 D Green–Naghdi {{model for}} <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> was {{justified}} by Li [13]. After {{that the general}} case was studied by Alvarez-Samaniego and Lannes [2]. Using a Nash–Moser scheme, the well-posdness of this model was proved by Alvarez-Samaniego (see [3]).|$|R
25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} wood grain. Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> {{and narrow}} tires of the 962 Le Mans would hinder the {{performance}} of the car over the long laps at Le Mans even with the increased power from the GT-class air restrictor. However Porsche believed that the larger fuel tank they were allowed in the GT-class would allow them to overcome this lack of speed by spending less time in the pits than the Group C cars, something which is key for an endurance race.|$|E
25|$|A flatboat is a {{rectangular}} boat with a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> and square ends generally used for freight and passengers on inland waterways. After {{serving in the}} Pennsylvania Line during the American Revolutionary War, Jacob Yoder invented and built a large boat at the Redstone Old Fort on the Monongahela River, which he freighted with flour and carried to New Orleans in May 1782. This was the first attempt to navigate the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for commercial purposes.|$|E
50|$|Tunnel valleys {{were formed}} by {{subglacial}} {{erosion by water}} and served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.|$|R
25|$|Armstrong (1–500 CE) has leading {{characteristics}} of being thin and tempered with particles of clay similar in {{color to the}} Peters ceramics, an oxidized color. They can have semi-pointed or <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> and are generally large; see Peters Cordmarked and Peters Plain.|$|R
50|$|Harris' {{design was}} not entirely successful, however. At speed the <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> pounded, and it showed poor {{performance}} in low wind which he ascribed to deep hulls (particularly aft), lack of stability to carry additional sail, too much wetted surface, and too heavy construction.|$|R
25|$|The modern multi-tenors {{evolved from}} {{horizontally}} mounted dual single-headed bass drums first {{used by the}} Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps in the late 1960s. Early multi-tenors had shells with a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom.</b> These drums sounded a lot like timpani, so they were called timp-toms. As drum sizes got smaller, more drums began {{to be added to}} multi-tenor configurations. The largest sets of multi-tenors had 7 drums and were carried by both the 1977 and 1992 Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps tenor lines.|$|E
25|$|Hortillon means {{market garden}} in Picard, and {{derives from the}} Latin hortillus, small garden. It is {{circulated}} in <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> boats, formerly called barque à cornet , due to the very raised front, which allows the boats to easily dock on the fragile shores of the cultivated fields. It is the port of upstream, located {{at the foot of}} the cathedral where a weekly market is held on the water, although the arrival by boat of the growers can be accomplished only once a year, in summer.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the hull is entirely {{dependent}} upon {{the needs of the}} design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution {{in the case of a}} racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an icebreaker or the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> of a landing craft.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> {{and close}} to brooks, the ground is often soaked. A boggy {{vegetation}} mainly constituted of mosses may develop there. This vegetation can appear homogeneous on the surface but can be covering quicksand, in which hikers may sink to the waist.|$|R
50|$|The Lands of Ferryhill {{consisted}} {{in those}} days of bogs fit only for rough grazing, and were described by Francis Douglas even as late as 1728 as amounting to ‘little conical hills over-run with heath and furze … the <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> between them drenched with stagnant water’.|$|R
50|$|Specialty surf boats {{typically}} have <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> and hard edges, similar to surf boards. The {{design of a}} surf kayak promotes {{the use of an}} ocean surf wave (moving wave) as opposed to a river or feature wave (moving water). They are typically made from rotomolded plastic, or fiberglass.|$|R
25|$|Integrals {{appear in}} many {{practical}} situations. If {{a swimming pool}} is rectangular with a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom,</b> then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), {{and the length of}} its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but precision engineering (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.|$|E
25|$|Sights on all {{the pistol}} barrels have varied, ranging from low sights, only, in the earlier years to a choice of either low or high sights, as well as no sights, for those pistol barrels {{intended}} for use with a scope. Various barrels have sometimes included ejectors as well as extractors, or extractors, only, as well as containing either a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> lug, a stepped bottom lug, or split bottom lugs. Barrels have been made available in either blued or stainless configurations, to match the finish available on Contender receivers.|$|E
25|$|Most modern power dories have a wider stern {{to support}} {{the weight of the}} outboard. Because <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> boats have a well founded {{reputation}} for pounding in anything other than flat sea conditions this type is not widespread. Some designers have taken element of the dory and incorporated these in V bottom boats.The planing shoe is a narrow flat section on the bottom of some V bottom boats that promotes planing at lower speed. The New Zealand designer John Welsford created a plywood, multi chine design with a wider planing shoe, suited to lower horsepower motors (10-30) suited to river and inshore use.|$|E
30|$|Unlike {{traditional}} 1 D models (e.g., Saint–Venant equations), computational cells {{need not}} feature <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> and cell edges need not indicate {{a straight line}} with a single height. Instead, each cell face and computational cell follow details of basic terrain morphology. This kind of inundation model is titled the HRS model [53].|$|R
50|$|A {{cocktail}} {{glass is}} a stemmed glass with an inverted cone bowl. Though {{they are often}} referred to as martini glasses, they differ from martini glasses in that they have smaller, narrower bowls with rounded or <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> while martini glasses generally have larger, wider bowls which are fully conical at the bottom.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} [3] are still valid for 1 D and 2 D cases with non-flat bottoms. Note that the {{estimates}} of the linearized equations lead to loss higher derivatives, which {{is the main reason}} for using the Nash–Moser scheme in [3]. However, such losses do not occur in 1 D for <b>flat</b> and non-flat <b>bottoms,</b> and so it is possible to construct a solution via a standard Picard scheme as in [13] for <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> and [8] for non-flat bottoms.|$|R
25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} {{production}} car {{shown to the}} public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules. Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (now up to 120 litres), and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.|$|E
25|$|By the 1820s {{the first}} shaped rolled rails {{had begun to}} be {{produced}} initially of a T shape which required a chair to hold them; the rails were held in position by iron wedges (which sometimes caused the rail to break when forced in) and later by wooden wedges, which became the standard. In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted I beam), which had a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted U section with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|E
50|$|Thirty-nine Dutch {{coasters}} {{had escaped}} {{the occupation of}} the Netherlands by the Germans on 10 May 1940 and were asked by the Dutch shipping bureau in London or by the Royal Navy to assist. The Dutch coasters, able to approach the beaches very closely due to their <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms,</b> rescued 22,698 men in total.|$|R
50|$|The {{brightness}} of VV Orionis dips regularly every 18 hours. The peak visual magnitude is 5.3, which varies slowly {{in between the}} dips. The minimum {{brightness of}} the dips alternates between magnitude 5.55 and 5.66. The deep minima have a somewhat rounded bottom, while the less deep minima have <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> with a constant magnitude for several hours.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, Heeg is a known water {{sports center}} {{with a variety of}} marinas and {{shipyard}}s. This is the shipyard for <b>flat</b> <b>bottoms</b> Piersma the most famous ???. This shipyard was taken into use more than 300 years ago. In the center of the village are a few buildings from the 18th century including the Dutch Reformed Church from 1745.|$|R
