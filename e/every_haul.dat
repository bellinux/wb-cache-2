It is simply one long strip, from eleven to thirteen fathoms in breadth, composed of very small meshes, and furnished, all along its length, with lead at one side and corks at the other. The men who cast this net are called the [...] "shooters," [...] and receive eleven shillings and sixpence a week, and a perquisite of one basket of fish each out of <b>every</b> <b>haul.</b>|$|E
50|$|This system {{creates a}} {{circular}} train flow {{where more than}} one train moves in the same direction. The principle of this system is based on several rope loops which adjoin and overlap {{each other in the}} stations. <b>Every</b> <b>haul</b> rope loop is supplied with its own drive and return machinery. In every station each vehicle of the train has to be disconnected from the current haul rope to the next haul rope in order to continue the circular and synchronized train flow. The haul rope loop change may occur only when all the trains are positioned at the standard stop position in the stations and are standstill and will be carried out during boarding/de-boarding of the passengers. Switches installed at the end stations will guide the train from one lane of the double lane track over to a single guideway in the end stations. During the station stop the switch will be repositioned that the train can leave the station at the other lane of the double lane track. For the functionality of the Pinched Loop concept the stations spans have to be approximately equidistant from each other.|$|E
40|$|Spanish {{demersal}} trawlers which {{operate in}} the Grand Sole and Porcupine Areas usually make between 50 and 80 hauls in each fishing trip, lasting around 15 days where fishing is almost continuous. Since the observer {{is not able to}} sample <b>every</b> <b>haul,</b> it is crucial to define a robust number of hauls to be sampled by the observer. A bootstrap analysis was carried out to determine the minimum number of hauls to be sampled to reduce significantly intra-variance within a fishing trip. Additionally, number of vessels and trips per vessel to be sampled was also analysed. Taking account the multistage sampling design and partitioning the over-all variability over the various stages, optimum sample sizes was estimated. On the other hand, fishermen may vary its retained catch and discard patterns whilst fishing trip occurs. Particular targets, discarded fish length or proportion of discarded/retained may change according to weather, occasional presence/absence of main target, storage space, quota exceeded, etc [...] . To look into these plausible differences, every fishing trip was divided in three periods, beginning of the trip, half period and ending period, containing each one the same number of hauls. Several statistical tests were applied to these three periods to look for differences as well as to fit a consistent division of hauls to every period. Finally, an optimal allocation sampling scheme is suggested, both in terms of minimum number of hauls to be sampled and temporal division of those hauls along the fishing trip...|$|E

25|$|Although Every's {{capture of}} the Gunsway has been cited as piracy's {{greatest}} exploit, {{it is possible that}} other pirates have perpetrated even more profitable raids. In April 1721, John Taylor and Olivier Levasseur captured the 700-ton Portuguese galleon Nossa Senhora do Cabo ("Our Lady of the Cape"), bound to Lisbon from the Portuguese colony of Goa. It had been damaged in an Indian Ocean storm and was undergoing repairs at the French island of Réunion when the pirates struck. Reportedly carrying the retiring Luís Carlos Inácio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louriçal, the galleon was laden with silver, gold, diamonds, gems, as well as pearls, silks, spices, works of art, and church regalia belonging to the Patriarch of the East Indies. The total value of the treasure on board has been estimated as being anywhere from £100,000 to £875,000 (£500,000 in diamonds and £375,000 in other cargo), all of which was divided among the crews of the Cassandra and the Victory, captained by Taylor and Levasseur respectively.

I was to take in the sail myself. I waited for a collapse; and then, while the ship was buried between two mounds of water, when it was impossible to see a hundred yards from her in any direction, and the canvass was actually dropping against the mast I gave the usual orders. <b>Every</b> man <b>hauled,</b> as if for life, and we had got the clews pretty well up, when the vessel came out of the cavern into the tempest, receiving the whole power of the gale, with a sudden surge, into the bellying canvass.

The mining company that operated the mines at Sulphurdale built 30 homes for the workers, a schoolhouse, a company store, and company offices. For a time, the town was unofficially known as Morrissey, after the operator of the mines. Twice <b>every</b> week, freighters <b>hauled</b> 20 tons of sulfur to the Union Pacific loading docks at Black Rock.

40|$|Goljingia procerum,hitherto regard~d as a mud-inhabiting detritus-feeder, {{has proved}} to be a {{temporary}} parasite on the polychaete Aphrodite aculeata. The Goljingia introduces its long, flexible proboscis through the body wall and into the body cavity of the poly-chaete, which then, for some time, drags along with the parasite. This observation and notes compiled from literature seem to indicate that commensalistic and parasitic habits are more commonly met with among sipunculids than hitherto assumed. So far very little is known about the feeding habits and food of Sipunculoidea. They are known to inhabit muddy and sandy bottoms, and they are supposed to feed on the detritus accumulating there and the microorganisms living in it (W. Fischer, 1925, p. 33 and 36, Wesenberg-Lund, 1937, p. 11). This latter as-sumption, however, is based on very few facts, field observations on these animals being scarce. Any fresh information about their ethology will, therefore, be of interest. In the north-western part of the Kattegat, Denmark, the level muddy bottom areas from 15 to 25 m depth are inhabited by a community with the brittle-star, Amphiura filiformis, and the sea-urchin, Echinocardium cordatum, as the quan-titatively dominating animals (Petersen, 1918, pp. 11 - 13 and plate IV). The community also comprises several polychaetes, among which the Atlantic-Pacific species Aphrodite aculeata L. is fairly common.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, a {{fleet of}} up to 50 vessels have been {{conducting}} a gillnet fishery on the continental slopes to the West of the British Isles, North of Shetland, at Rockall and Hatton bank. These vessels, though mostly based in Spain are registered in the UK, Germany and other countries outside the EU such as Panama. The fishery is conducted in depths between 200 and 1200 meters, with the main target species being monkfish (200 - 800 m) and deepwater sharks (800 - 1200 m). These fisheries are not well documented or understood {{and they seem to}} be largely unregulated, with little or no information on landings, catch composition and discards. Vessels currently participating in the fishery are reported to use up to 250 km of gear, and the nets are left fishing unattended and <b>hauled</b> <b>every</b> 3 - 10 days with trip lengths varying between 4 – 8 weeks. The amount of fishing gear used in the fisheries, the lengths of the fleets, {{and the fact that the}} nets are unattended much of the time, make it very likely that a large quantity of nets are lost, while there is also evidence of illegal dumping of sheet netting.

2500|$|The Ingram {{management}} team operated {{as much of}} the Rock Island as they could. Trains slowly began to move, with more traffic being <b>hauled</b> <b>every</b> week of the strike. President Jimmy Carter issued a back-to-work order that BRAC dismissed. Still more traffic flowed on the strikebound Rock Island.

Projections indicated {{that by the end of}} November the company would be handling about half of its prestrike tonnage and earning a profit of about $5 million per month. In other words, the company was winning the strike." [...] Seeing the trains rolling despite the strike and fearing a Florida East Coast strikebreaking situation, the unions appealed to the FRA and ICC for relief. Despite the fact that Rock Island management had been able to move 80% of pre-strike tonnage, at the behest of the Carter Administration, the ICC declared a transportation emergency declaring that the Rock Island would not be able to move the 1979 grain harvest to market. This despite the railroad's movement of more grain out of Iowa in the week immediately preceding the order than during any week in its history.
