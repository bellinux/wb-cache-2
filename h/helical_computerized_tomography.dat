40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} imaging exams more {{commonly}} used for abdominal aortic aneurysms evaluation - ultrasonography, conventional computerized tomography, <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> and nuclear magnetic angioresonance - comparing the preoperative measurements reached by those radiological methods with the measurements made during the surgical procedures. METHODS: Patients who had indication of elective transperitoneal surgical treatment for their abdominal aortic aneurysms {{were included in the}} study. The initial diagnosis of the aortic dilatation was made by ultrasonography and, after the surgical treatment was indicated, the patient was submitted to another imaging method. Sixty patients were divided into 3 groups according to the complementary imaging method (conventional computerised tomography, <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography,</b> nuclear magnetic angioresonance). The ultrasonography of the first 20 patients were joined in a fourth group. There were considered in the study the measurements of the transversal diameter of the proximal neck, maximum transversal diameter of the aneurysm, straight-line length and transversal diameter of the common iliac arteries given by the imaging methods. The same measurements were made by using a caliper during the surgical procedure, and then compared to the values obtained from the radiological exams. RESULTS: The maximum transverse diameter had a range measurement variation of 4. 5 to 13. 6 cm in the intraoperative, with no statistically significant differences when compared with all the imaging tests. The ultrasonography, however, overestimated the measurements of the proximal neck and the common iliac arteries, in comparison with intraoperative measures. The length of the aorta aneurysm obtained by the conventional computerized tomography was significantly lower if compared to the measures done with the calliper during the operation. The <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> and the nuclear magnetic angioresonance provided measurements with no significant differences in the statistic view when compared to the intraoperative measures. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is a reliable method for the diagnosis and follow-up of the aorta abdominal aneurysms, but insufficient for endovascular surgery planning. The conventional computed tomography can provoke distortion in the length measurements of the aorta dilatation. Helical computed tomography and nuclear magnetic angioresonance provided precise measurements of all the studied parameters, being of great utility for surgical planning...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> {{was investigated in}} this retrospective study evaluating 285 patients. The study was aimed to compare the diagnostic efficiency of unenhanced <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (helical CT), ultrasound examination (US), abdominal plain film and intravenous urography (IVU) {{in the management of}} patients with acute flank pain for the diagnosis of ureteral calculi. Additionally the diagnostic efficiency of helical CT and ultrasound examination in the research of patients with unclear acute diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal pain and fever and abdominal pain because of surgical procedures was assessed. During a period of 3 years 110 patients with acute flank pain were examined with helical CT, US, abdominal plain film and IVU. These patients were defined to be either true positive or negative for ureterolithiasis based on the follow- up data. The other patients with unclear acute diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal pain and fever and abdominal pain because of surgical procedures were examined with helical CT and US. Results: In 50 of 110 patients with acute flank pain was caused by an ureteral calculus. Unenhanced helical CT reaches a distinctively increased diagnostic value (sensitivity 98 %, specifity 98 %) in the evaluation of acute flank pain as compared to US (sensitivity 6 %, specivity 100 %) and conventional radiologic imaging (abdominal plain film- sensitivity 49 %, specifity 92 % and IVU- sensitivity 56 %, Specifity 95 %). In 39 of 58 patients with acute flank pain with no evidence of ureterolithiasis alternative diagnosis could be made by helical CT. In the groups of patients with acute abdominal pain the detection rate of pathological findings was also higher with helical CT than with US. Conclusion: Unenhanced helical CT is more effective and faster than US, abdominal plain film and IVU in the management of patients with acute flank pain. This non- invasive procedure is to be considered as method of choice for patients with clinically unclear flank pain. Apart from the exact determination of the calculus size and the detection of urinary obstruction this method may allow to diagnose non- urologic causes for acute flank pain within in a few minutes.

However, the prognostic role of both initial diagnostic strategy {{and the use of}} NT-proBNP and TnT for screening for long-term probability of RVD remains unknown. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the role of helical CT and NT-proBNP in detection of RVD in the acute phase. In addition, the value of NT-proBNP for ruling out RVD at long-term follow-up was assessed. Methods Sixty-three non-high risk APE patients were studied. RVD was assessed at admission in the emergency department by CT and TTE, and both NT-proBNP and TnT samples were taken. These, excepting CT, were repeated seven months later. Results At admission RVD was detected by CT in 37 (59 %) patients. RVD in CT correlated strongly with RVD in TTE (p Conclusions TTE does not confer further benefit when helical CT is used for screening for RVD in non-high risk APE. All the patients who were found to have RVD in TTE at seven months follow-up had had RVD in the acute phase CT as well. Thus, patients without RVD in diagnostic CT do not seem to require further routine follow-up to screen for RVD later. On the other hand, persistent RVD and thus need for TTE control can be ruled out by assessment of NT-proBNP at follow-up. A follow-up protocol based on these findings is suggested. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} compare {{accuracy}} levels of ultrasonography and spiral computerized tomography for detection of the ureteral calculi in patients {{admitted to the}} emergency department with flank pain. Methods: The patients presented with either unilateral or bilateral flank pain to the emergency department over a four-month period and who were suspected to be renal colic were included into the study. All of the study patients with distended bladder after hydration had ultrasonography (USG) and unhanced <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (UHCT) performed by two independent radiologists. Results: Of the 76 patients with flank pain, CT detected ureteral calculi in 47 out of 48 patients (97. 9 %) and USG detected ureteral calculi in 34 out of the 48 patients (70. 83 %). CT detected uretral calculi in 14 patients which was not detected by USG. CT also detected renal calculi in 7 patients which was not detected by USG. A kappa value of 0. 62 (p< 0. 001) was determined, indicating a moderate concordance between CT and USG in detecting ureteral calculi. Also a kappa value of 0. 65 (p< 0. 001) was determined in the overall diagnostic performance of the both imaging tools in detecting renal calculi. Conclusions: Computerized tomography is better than ultrasonography in detecting urinary calculus in patients presented to the emergency department with flank pain.

In this study it is aimed to compare {{effectiveness}} of unenhanced <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (UHCT), KUB and ultrasonography (US) for detection of residual RFs and predicition of stone releated events following percutaneous nephrolitotomy (PNL). Materials and Methods Patients underwent PNL for radiopaque stones between November 2007 and February 2010 were followed. Patients were examined within 24 - 48 hours after the procedure by KUB, US and UHCT. For stone size 4 mm was accepted as cut off level of significance. Sensitivity and specificity of KUB and US for detection of RFs and value of them for prediction of stone related events were calculated. Results SFS was achieved in 95 patients (54. 9 %) and when cut off value of 4 mm for RFs was employed, SFS was achieved in 131 patients (75. 7 %). Sensitivity was 70. 5 % for KUB, and 52. 5 % for US. UHCT was shown to be significantly more efficient for detection of RFs compared to both KUB (p= 0. 01) and US (p= 0. 001). When cut off level of 4 mm employed, sensitivity of KUB and US increased to 85. 7 % and 57. 1 %. Statistical significant superiority of UHCT still remained (p value vs. KUB: 0. 03 and p value vs. US: 0. 008). Conclusion UHCT is the most sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting RFs after PNL.

We propose <b>helical</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> as a more efficient way to gain renal function information. Renal parenchymal volume is measured and percent total renal volume {{is used as a}} surrogate marker for differential renal function. Materials and Methods: Computerized tomography and diuretic enhanced nuclear renal scan were performed in 33 patients with chronic obstruction. Computerized tomography was contrast enhanced in 23 cases and nonenhanced in 10. Diagnoses included ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureteral stricture and extrinsic compression. Using semiautomated boundary delineation with manual editing method the parenchymal volume of each kidney was measured and percent renal volume was calculated. Percent renal volume was compared with percent renal function, as determined by nuclear renal scan. Correlations between the 2 measures were evaluated using the Spearman or Pearson coefficient. Results: Strong correlations were observed between percent renal function and percent renal volume in all cases (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 001), including the enhanced (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 001) and nonenhanced (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 001) groups.

CT showed a pancreatic mass (30 cases), pancreatic enlargement (17 cases), pancreatic cystic lesion (2 cases) and pancreatic calcification (1 case) in 50 out of 52 patients (96. 2 %). EUS-FNA found a clear pancreatic tumor image in all patients (100 %). The accuracy of EUS for evaluating portal blood vessels, superior mesenteric artery, T alone, N alone and combined TN staging was 86. 5 %, 94. 2 %, 84. 7 %, 67. 3 % and 55. 8 %, respectively. In addition to cytological material from 50 patients, microfragments from 43 patients were sent for histological analysis. Two patients (3. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Discrete {{tomography}} is {{a particular}} case of <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> that deals with the reconstruction of objects made of just one homogeneous material, where it is sometimes possible {{to reduce the number}} of projections to no more than four. Most methods for standard <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> cannot be applied in the former case and ad hoc techniques must be developed to handle so few projections...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study aims {{to relate}} bone density in Hounsfield units (Hu) {{with the primary}} implant {{stability}} measured by insertion torque (Ncm) and resonance frequency analysis (ISQ). Materials and Methods: Ten patients were included in this study. A total of 54 implant sites were provided from 10 <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> scans. The <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> scan {{was used for the}} preoperative evaluation of bone density for each patient. The bone mean density around planned implants was determined with Physioplanet TM software. Bone quality according resistance to drilling, insertion torque and resonance frequency measurements were recorded. Results: A statistically significant relationship was observed between bone quality density and location with ISQ values. Conclusions: This research demonstrates a strong relationship between the bone density values from <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> and the location in the maxillaries. A correlation exists between bone quality, according to the Lekholm and Zarb classification, and Hu <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> values. The primary implant stability measured with resonance frequency analysis depends on bone density values, bone quality and implant location...|$|R
