5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located {{deep within the}} body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the}} highest core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
5|$|Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced {{necks and}} round ears. Of the living, non-hybrid felids, the lion <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to the tiger {{in length and}} weight. Its skull {{is very similar to}} that of the tiger, {{although}} the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with dark spots on their body. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|Rates of dengue {{increased}} 30fold between 1960 and 2010. This {{increase is}} believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming. The geographical distribution is around the equator. Of the 2.5billion people living in areas where it is common 70% are from Asia and the Pacific. An infection with dengue <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world. It is the most common viral disease transmitted by arthropods, and has a disease burden estimated at 1,600 disability-adjusted life years per million population.

The following month, Baroš scored a career high of four goals against San Marino, in a World Cup qualifier which the Czech Republic won 7–0. In doing so, he became only the second player from the Czech Republic to score four goals in an international match. He was selected {{as part of the}} squad for Euro 2012. After the tournament, during which he failed to score, Baroš announced his retirement from international football, having scored a total of 41 international goals in 93 matches.

5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world.

Its telecommunications network <b>is</b> <b>second</b> <b>only</b> to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E
5|$|UST is Asia's only {{remaining}} Pontifical university. Annuario Pontificio, the annual official directory of the Holy See, in its edition {{for the year}} 2000, lists all the Catholic and or Pontifical institutes of higher learning, grouping them into two categories: Roman Ateneums and Catholic Universities. Only 24 are called Pontifical, and of these 24, six are located in Rome (Gregorian University, Lateran University, Urbanian University, University of Santo Tomas (known as The Angelicum), Salisian University and Holy Cross University); three are in Europe; fourteen in Latin America; and one in Asia, this one being the University of Santo Tomas of Manila. The oldest university to be denominated by the Holy See as Pontifical is the Jesuit Gregorian University in Rome. Although founded in 1551, it was Pope Pius IX who, in 1873, permitted the school to assume the title of ‘Pontifical University.’” All the other abovementioned 23 universities received the title of Pontifical in the 20th century.
