50|$|Cellulose {{insulating}} material plants essentially exist of a feeding unit with primary {{reduction of the}} raw material, a dosing system for adding flame retarding agent, a defibration unit, a <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit</b> and the packaging unit.|$|E
50|$|The raw {{material}} is given loose or in bales into the primary reduction unit (for example a shredder). After this reduction, the flame retardant is added. The {{core of the}} cellulose insulating material plant is a Whirlwind Mill. This mill is able to fray out the material, what leads to fluffy, optimally defibrated flocks that contain only very small amounts of dust. Furthermore the flame retardant is stuck to the flocks during the defibration process. After the mill the material is conveyed pneumatically to the <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit,</b> where the dusty air and the cellulose fibers get separated. The finished fibers come to the packaging station, {{where they will be}} weight and packaged.|$|E
40|$|An {{emission}} factor {{is a tool}} {{that is used to}} estimate air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. It relates the quantity of pollutants released from a source to some activities associated with those emissions. To determine the quantity of pollutant released from copper and its alloys smelting furnaces, 63 samples from emission gases were collected on cellulose ester membrane filters in three 8 -hour-shifts within 24 hours during a week at three locations. Samples were weighed and analyzed to measure the heavy metal content by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The {{emission factor}}s for location 1, without control equipment, for total particulate matter (TPM), Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Cd were 87. 689, 2. 076, 37. 071, 0. 917, 0. 023, 0. 074, and 0. 021 g/Mg of products respectively. Emission factors for location 3, with <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit</b> as control equipment, were 8. 139, 0. 152, 3. 921, 0. 055, 0. 003, 0. 008, and 0. 007 g/Mg for the above-mentioned parameters respectively. Finally those were 95. 828, 2. 228, 40. 992, 0. 972, 0. 026, 0. 082, and 0. 028 g/Mg as a whole set respectively. Samples of location 2 were collected from inlet of <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit</b> and their results were used only for <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit</b> efficiency calculation...|$|E
40|$|Fine {{particles}} {{are associated with}} varied health impacts and mutagenic activity and have recently emerged {{among the most important}} pollutants worldwide in terms of human health. Anthropogenic sources of fine particles include mainly industrial combustion processes, then the availability of advanced techniques to efficiently remove them from exhausts becomes an essential topics for the associated health risk reduction. Waste incinerators represent certainly a minor source of fine particles if they apply Best Available Techniques, but technical improvements to decrease ultrafine particle number concentration in flue gas are required to upgrade the social acceptance of these plants. The present paper provides the results of an experimental investigation on a pilot scale filtering system installed on the industrial waste incinerator "Ecolombardia 4 " located in Filago (BG), in the northern of Italy, downstream of the Air Pollution Control Devices except the final fabric filter, to decrease particle emission below 50 μg/m 3 (11 % vol O 2, dry gas). The pilot plant combined a fabric filter with bags made of PTFE with a PTFE membrane with a filtering system of glass microfibers respectively as a second and a third stage of filtration (the first <b>dedusting</b> <b>unit</b> was the early stage electrostatic precipitator of the industrial plant). The pilot filtering system allowed to abate the total dust emission around 27 - 38 μg/m 3 (11 % vol O 2, dry gas) or 3, 8 x 10 2 - 5, 5 x 10 2 particle/cm 3, registering a filtering efficiency of submicron particles respectively of 75 % (mass) and 67 % (number). The comparison with similar plants shows the potentiality of the microfiber glass filtering unit {{to be used as a}} final polishing device for submicron particle effective reduction in waste incinerator flue gas...|$|E
