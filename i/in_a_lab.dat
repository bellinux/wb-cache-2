5|$|Gem-quality {{diamonds}} grown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> can be chemically, {{physically and}} optically identical to naturally occurring ones. The mined diamond industry has undertaken legal, {{marketing and distribution}} countermeasures to protect its market from the emerging presence of synthetic diamonds. Synthetic diamonds can be distinguished by spectroscopy in the infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray wavelengths. The DiamondView tester from De Beers uses UV fluorescence to detect trace impurities of nitrogen, nickel or other metals in HPHT or CVD diamonds.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to {{initiate}} the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E
5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab,</b> where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E

25|$|Ovarian tissue banking Ovarian {{tissue is}} frozen after oophorectomy. Even after {{long-term}} androgen therapy, ovaries usually retain usable follicles. Eventual use of frozen ovaries will require replantation into the transgender man for stimulation and harvest, but may eventually be possible <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> as techniques for tissue culture improve.

25|$|Finally, even subtle nature {{manipulations}} {{can increase}} well-being or other indicators of well-being. For instance, simply having plants <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> can increase intrinsic aspirations, decrease extrinsic aspirations, and encourage more generous decision making. These effects were also mediated by nature connectedness and autonomy. Also, virtual nature {{has been found}} to provide some psychological benefits (but not as much as real nature). These studies demonstrate the positive relationship between nature exposure, feeling connected to nature, and subjective well-being.|$|E

25|$|At the {{temperatures}} and densities in stellar cores {{the rates of}} fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (T ≈ 15MK) and density (160g/cm3), the energy release rate is only 276μW/cm3—about {{a quarter of the}} volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat. Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−E/kT)), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: T ≈ 0.1–1.0×109 K.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly {{may play}} an {{important}} role here, both from the perspective of encapsulating cells and proteins, as well as creating scaffolds on the right physical scale for engineered tissue constructs and cellular ingrowth. The micromasonry is a prime technology to get cells grown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> to assemble into three-dimensional shapes. To break down tissue into single-cell building blocks, researchers have to dissolve the extracellular mortar that normally binds them together. But once that glue is removed, it's quite difficult to get cells to reassemble into the complex structures that make up our natural tissues. While cells aren't easily stackable, building blocks are. So the micromasonry starts with the encapsulation of living cells in polymer cubes. From there, the blocks self-assemble in any shape using templates.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study done}} by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 {{different}} children ages {{three to four}} and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed {{to play with the}} toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab.</b> The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders {{in order to create a}} better balance.|$|E

25|$|Pitezel {{agreed to}} fake {{his own death}} so that his wife could collect on a $10,000 life {{insurance}} policy, which she was to split with Holmes and Jeptha Howe. The scheme, which was {{to take place in}} Philadelphia, called for Pitezel to set himself up as an inventor under the name B.F. Perry, and then be killed and disfigured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> explosion. Holmes was to find an appropriate cadaver {{to play the role of}} Pitezel. Instead, Holmes killed Pitezel by knocking him unconscious with chloroform and setting his body on fire with the use of benzene. In his confession, Holmes implied that Pitezel was still alive after he used the chloroform on him, prior to being set on fire. However, forensic evidence presented at Holmes' later trial showed that chloroform had been administered after Pitezel's death (a fact which the insurance company was unaware of), presumably to fake suicide to exonerate Holmes should he be charged with murder.|$|E
25|$|Use of the fMRI {{has been}} left out of legal debates {{throughout}} its history. Use of this technology has not been allowed due to holes in the evidence supporting fMRI. First, most evidence supporting fMRIs accuracy was done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> under controlled circumstances with solid facts. This type of testing does not pertain to real life. Real-life scenarios can be much more complicated with many other affecting factors. It has been shown that many other factors affect BOLD other than a typical lie. There have been tests done showing that drug use alters blood flow in the brain, which drastically affects the outcome of BOLD testing. Furthermore, individuals with diseases or disorders such as schizophrenia or compulsive lying can lead to abnormal results as well. Lastly, there is an ethical question relating to fMRI scanning. This testing of BOLD has led to controversy over if fMRIs are an invasion of privacy. Being able to scan and interpret what people are thinking may be thought of as immoral and the controversy still continues.|$|E
25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E

25|$|When Walter {{arrives in}} Albuquerque – on his 52nd {{birthday}} – he intimidates Gretchen and Elliott into putting his remaining {{money into a}} trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and gives her the location of Hank's body so she can clear herself as a suspect in his death, and finally admits {{to her that he}} entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead on the floor as the police arrive and sweep the lab.|$|E
