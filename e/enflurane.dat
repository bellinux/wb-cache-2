5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as <b>enflurane,</b> isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxicâ€”it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as <b>enflurane</b> and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, <b>enflurane</b> or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, <b>enflurane,</b> isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom.

2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, <b>enflurane,</b> and halothane, although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
50|$|Together with <b>enflurane</b> and halothane, it {{replaced}} the flammable ethers {{used in the}} pioneer days of surgery. Its name comes from being a structural isomer of <b>enflurane,</b> hence {{they have the same}} empirical formula.|$|E
50|$|The {{obsolete}} (as an anaesthetic) agent methoxyflurane had a nephrotoxic {{effect and}} caused acute renal failure, usually {{attributed to the}} liberation of fluoride ions from its metabolism. <b>Enflurane</b> is similarly metabolised but the liberation of fluoride results in a lower plasma level and <b>enflurane</b> related renal failure seemed unusual if seen at all.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enflurane</b> is a {{structural}} isomer of isoflurane. It vaporizes readily, {{but is a}} liquid at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|In the workplace, {{people may}} be exposed to <b>enflurane</b> by {{breathing}} it in as a waste anaesthetic gas, swallowing it, eye contact, or skin contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for exposure to waste anaesthetic gas of 2 ppm (15.1 mg/m3) over a 60-minute period. Symptoms of occupational exposure to <b>enflurane</b> include eye irritation, central nervous system depression, analgesia, anesthesia, convulsions, and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Attempts to find anesthetics {{with less}} {{metabolism}} led to halogenated ethers such as <b>enflurane</b> and isoflurane. The incidence of hepatic reactions with these agents is lower. The exact degree of hepatotoxic potential of <b>enflurane</b> is debated, {{although it is}} minimally metabolized. Isoflurane is essentially not metabolized and reports of associated liver injury are quite rare. Small amounts of trifluoroacetic acid can be formed from both halothane and isoflurane metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Enflurane</b> also {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for seizures, and should especially {{not be used}} on people with epilepsy. [...] Like all potent inhalation anaesthetic agents it is a known trigger of malignant hyperthermia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enflurane</b> (2-chloro-1,1,2,-trifluoroethyl-difluoromethyl ether) is a {{halogenated}} ether. Developed by Ross Terrell in 1963, it {{was first}} used clinically in 1966. It was increasingly used for inhalational anesthesia during the 1970s and 1980s but {{is no longer in}} common use.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, <b>enflurane</b> {{produces}} a dose-related depression of myocardial contractility with an associated decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Between 2% and 5% of the inhaled dose is oxidised in the liver, producing fluoride ions and difluoromethoxy-difluoroacetic acid. This is {{significantly higher than}} the metabolism of its structural isomer isoflurane.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of the action of general anaesthetics have not been delineated. [...] <b>Enflurane</b> acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA, glycine, and 5-HT3 receptors, and as a negative allosteric modulator of the AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors, {{as well as of}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
50|$|Many {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today. They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular, volatile anaesthetics, include halothane, <b>enflurane,</b> and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.|$|E
50|$|CYP2E1 is {{expressed}} in high levels in the liver, where it works to clear toxins from the body. In doing so, CYP2E1 bioactivates a variety of common anesthetics, including acetaminophen, halothane, <b>enflurane,</b> and isoflurane. The oxidation of these molecules by CYP2E1 can produce harmful substances such as trifluoroacetic acid chloride, and is {{a major reason for}} their observed hepatotoxicity in patients.|$|E
50|$|Several inhaled general {{anesthetic}} agents, {{including the}} most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, halothane, proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used. Modern fluorinated anesthetics are longer-lasting still and almost insoluble in blood, which accelerates the awakening. Examples include sevoflurane, desflurane, <b>enflurane,</b> and isoflurane, all hydrofluorocarbon derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|Molecular {{structures}} of general anaesthetics {{widely used in}} medicine are very simple and diverse {{so that there is}} no obvious structure-activity relationship (see {{structures of}} general anaesthetics widely used in medicine: 1 - ethanol, 2 - chloroform, 3 - diethyl ether, 4 - fluroxene, 5 - halothane, 6 - methoxyflurane, 7 - <b>enflurane,</b> 8 - isoflurane, 9 - desflurane, 10 - sevoflurane) ...|$|E

50|$|Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is {{a highly}} {{fluorinated}} methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Like halothane, <b>enflurane,</b> and isoflurane, it is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) optical isomers (enantiomers). Together with sevoflurane, it is gradually replacing isoflurane for human use, except in economically undeveloped areas, where its high cost precludes its use. It has the most rapid onset and offset of the volatile anesthetic drugs used for general anesthesia due to its low solubility in blood.|$|E

5000|$|Desflurane, {{along with}} <b>enflurane</b> {{and to a}} lesser extent isoflurane, has been shown to react with the carbon dioxide {{absorbent}} in anesthesia circuits to produce detectable levels of carbon monoxide through degradation of the anesthetic agent. The [...] absorbent Baralyme, when dried, is most culpable for the production of carbon monoxide from desflurane degradation, although it is also seen with soda lime absorbent as well. Dry conditions in the carbon dioxide absorbent are conducive to this phenomenon, such as those resulting from high fresh gas flows.|$|E

50|$|No {{anaesthetic}} agent currently in use meets all these requirements, nor can any {{anaesthetic agent}} be considered safe. There are inherent risks and drug interactions that {{are specific to}} each and every patient. The agents in widespread current use are isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is a common adjuvant gas, {{making it one of the}} most long-lived drugs still in current use. Because of its low potency, it cannot produce anesthesia on its own but is frequently combined with other agents. Halothane, an agent introduced in the 1950s, has been almost completely replaced in modern anesthesia practice by newer agents because of its shortcomings. Partly because of its side effects, <b>enflurane</b> never gained widespread popularity.|$|E
50|$|Vecuronium {{operates}} by {{competing for}} the cholinoceptors at the motor end plate thereby exerting its muscle-relaxing properties which are used adjunctively to general anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia, the time to recovery to 25% of control (clinical duration) is approximately 25 to 40 minutes after injection and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 45 to 65 minutes after injection of intubating dose. The neuromuscular blocking action of vecuronium is slightly enhanced {{in the presence of}} potent inhalation anesthetics. If vecuronium is first administered more than 5 minutes after the start of the inhalation of <b>enflurane,</b> isoflurane, or halothane, or when a steady state has been achieved, the intubating dose of vecuronium may be decreased by approximately 15%.|$|E
5000|$|Intratracheal {{instillation}} {{is often}} performed with mice, rats, or hamsters, with hamsters often preferred because their mouth can be opened widely to aid viewing the procedure, {{and because they}} are more resistant to lung diseases than rats. [...] Instillation is performed either through inserting a needle or catheter down the mouth and throat, or through surgically exposing the trachea and penetrating it with a needle. Generally, short-acting inhaled anesthetic drugs such as halothane, metaphane, or <b>enflurane</b> are used during the instillation procedure. Saline solution is usually used as a delivery vehicle in a typical volume of 1-2 mL/kg body weight. [...] A wide range of substances can be tested, including both soluble materials and insoluble particles or fibers, including nanomaterials.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to classify inhalants by the effect they have on the body. Solvents such as toluene and gasoline act as depressants, causing users to feel relaxed and sleepy. Many inhalants act primarily as asphyxiant gases, with their primary effect due to oxygen deprivation. Nitrous oxide can be categorized as a psychedelic drug, as it can cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Other agents may have more direct effects at receptors, as inhalants exhibit a variety of mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action of many non-medical inhalants have not been well elucidated. Anesthetic gases used for surgery, such as nitrous oxide or <b>enflurane,</b> are believed to induce anesthesia primarily by acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, open channel blockers that bind {{to the inside of}} the calcium channels on the outer surface of the neuron, and provide high levels of NMDA receptor blockade for a short period of time.|$|E

5000|$|In rare cases, {{repeated}} exposure to halothane in adults was noted {{to result in}} severe liver injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome {{was referred to as}} halothane hepatitis, and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by <b>enflurane</b> and isoflurane. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for inhalation induction of anaesthesia [...] However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of halothane in children.|$|E
