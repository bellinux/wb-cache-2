5|$|Lucan's {{disappearance}} has captivated the public's imagination for decades, {{with thousands}} of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, {{turned out to be}} a British ex-politician, John Stonehouse, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia {{turned out to be a}}n American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the News of the World as a <b>hoaxer.</b> In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective thought he had tracked the earl to Goa, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from StHelens. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedHoaxes {{are part}} of the fabric of history. While many provide humor and lighthearted joy, the {{criminal}} <b>hoax</b> does not. To date, researchers have included aspects of the criminal <b>hoax</b> in larger academic works. This is an original typology that sets forth the criminal <b>hoax</b> as a distinct part of the larger field of law and public policy. This work provides newly created definitions including four distinct categories of hoaxes: the monetary <b>hoax,</b> the attention getter <b>hoax,</b> the hate crime <b>hoax</b> and the racial <b>hoax.</b> It further illustrates these types with actual detailed accounts of <b>hoaxes</b> and provides insights to each one. It makes policy recommendations concerning the four categories of needs: 1. legislative action, 2. a nationwide statistical database of <b>hoax</b> events, 3. media involvement, and 4. law enforcement training and action to deal with criminal <b>hoaxes.</b> Finally, it recommends further research to identify the causes and motivations of vipers. The ultimate goal of this project is to find ways to eliminate criminal <b>hoaxes...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1926, a <b>hoaxer</b> named Frank Power {{claimed in}} the Sunday Referee {{newspaper}} that Kitchener's {{body had been}} found by a Norwegian fisherman. Power brought a coffin back from Norway and prepared it for burial in St. Paul's. At this point, however, the authorities intervened and the coffin was opened {{in the presence of}} police and a distinguished pathologist. The box was found to contain only tar for weight. There was widespread public outrage at Power, but he was never prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, the Adelaide Daily Mail {{raised the}} {{possibility}} that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the <b>hoaxer.</b> Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney Sunday Sun, which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.|$|E
25|$|Jones's and Nebel's {{claims were}} first made public in 1976 (in Donald Bain's The Control of Candy Jones, {{published}} by Playboy Press). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a <b>hoaxer</b> of long standing {{and as he}} was not above hoaxing his radio audience, some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's past were genuine. Later skeptics would argue that an alleged false memory syndrome was a more plausible explanation.|$|E
50|$|Virus <b>hoaxes</b> {{are usually}} {{harmless}} and accomplish {{nothing more than}} annoying people who identify it as a <b>hoax</b> and waste the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of <b>hoaxes</b> have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to delete the file, possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the jdbgmgr.exe virus <b>hoax</b> and the SULFNBK.EXE <b>hoax.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>hoax</b> is {{something}} intended to deceive or defraud. When a newspaper or {{the news reports}} a fake story, it {{is known as a}} <b>hoax.</b> Misleading public stunts, scientific frauds, false bomb threats and business scams as <b>hoaxes.</b> [...] A common aspect that <b>hoaxes</b> have is that they are all meant to deceive or lie. For something to become a <b>hoax,</b> the lie must have something more to offer. It must be outrageous, dramatic but also has to be believable and ingenious. Above all, it must be able to attract attention from the public. Once it has done that then a <b>hoax</b> is in full effect.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that the Knutson expedition ever set sail (the government of Norway went through considerable turmoil in 1355) and the information from Cnoyen as relayed by Mercator states specifically that the eight men who came to Norway in 1364 were not survivors of a recent expedition, but descended from the colonists who had settled the distant lands several generations earlier. Also, those early 19th century books, which aroused a great deal of interest among Scandinavian Americans, would have been available to a late 19th-century <b>hoaxer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carr's {{works were}} notably {{influenced}} by the writings of Nesta Webster and the well known French <b>hoaxer</b> Léo Taxil (see Taxil hoax). He also refers to the theories of l'abbé Augustin Barruel and John Robison who explained the French Revolution as a Freemasonic plot linked to the German Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt (frequently associated to the conspiracy theory of the New World Order). One of Carr's books published after his death, The Conspiracy to Destroy All Existing Governments and Religions clearly refers to Robison's main work: Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies (1798).|$|E

5000|$|The {{key word}} in {{something}} becoming a <b>hoax</b> is [...] "public". A lie or a deception only becomes a <b>hoax</b> {{when it is}} acknowledged by the public. A popular <b>hoax</b> that is evident in today's times would be the 'Microwave your spoon' <b>hoax.</b> This <b>hoax</b> originated from a video which shows a metallic spoon being heated inside a microwave oven. It then further on {{suggests that it is}} easier to eat ice cream when the spoon is first microwaved. This <b>hoax</b> has fooled many people on social media into believing that the spoon could be microwaved, only to find that their microwave was damaged. The point of this <b>hoax</b> was to show how gullible people can be on social media and to prove that not everything you read or see on the internet is true.|$|R

In reality, the [...] "Abyssinian royals" [...] were some of Cole's friends in blackface and disguise, including a young Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Group friends; it became known as the Dreadnought hoax. Cole had picked Dreadnought because she was at that time the most prominent and visible symbol of Britain's naval might.

2500|$|Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised {{for being}} too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to {{indicate}} a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] was a blatant <b>hoaxer.</b> The investigation {{used it as a}} point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] <b>hoaxer</b> was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The <b>hoaxer</b> appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact the <b>hoaxer</b> had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.|$|E

5|$|Hemlock <b>Hoax</b> is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on <b>Hoax</b> and tell him about a murder. <b>Hoax</b> rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and <b>Hoax</b> gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, <b>Hoax</b> captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. <b>Hoax</b> then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves.

Bluff Creek had also been the site of well-known Bigfoot <b>hoaxer</b> Ray Wallace' activities in 1958. In Patterson's book, he mentions meeting with Wallace once. Later, Daegling cites certain features in the film and the storyline as suspicious.|$|E

50|$|Russell-Brown {{argues that}} racial <b>hoaxes</b> are devised, perpetrated, and {{successful}} because they {{take advantage of}} fears and stereotypes.

She argues that anyone performing a racial <b>hoax</b> should face criminal charges, particularly if a black person is targeted, and that <b>hoaxes</b> targeting black people create more severe problems than those against other racial groups. Letha A. See in Violence as Seen Through a Prism of Color (2001) sees the <b>hoax</b> as a unique method used against specific racial groups, rather than against individuals. Sally S.
