40|$|Mesh 2 d is a Fortran 90 program {{designed}} to generate two-dimensional structured grids of the form [x(i),y(i,j) ] where [x,y] are grid coordinates identified by indices (i,j). The x(i) coordinates alone {{can be used to}} specify a one-dimensional grid. Because the x-coordinates vary only with the i index, a two-dimensional grid is composed in part of straight vertical lines. However, the nominally horizontal y(i,j{sub 0 }) coordinates along index i are permitted to undulate or otherwise vary. Mesh 2 d also assigns an integer material type to each grid cell, mtyp(i,j), in a user-specified manner. The complete grid is specified through three separate input files defining the x(i), y(i,j), and mtyp(i,j) variations. The overall mesh is constructed from <b>grid</b> <b>zones</b> that are typically then subdivided into a collection of smaller grid cells. The <b>grid</b> <b>zones</b> usually correspond to distinct materials or larger-scale geometric shapes. The structured <b>grid</b> <b>zones</b> are identified through uppercase indices (I,J). Subdivision of zonal regions into grid cells can be done uniformly, or nonuniformly using either a polynomial or geometric skewing algorithm. Grid cells may be concentrated backward, forward, or toward both ends. Figure 1 illustrates the above concepts {{in the context of a}} simple four <b>zone</b> <b>grid...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{combination}} of a zone and a latitude band defines a <b>grid</b> <b>zone.</b> The zone is always written first, followed by the latitude band.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} algorithms implemented for positioning a wheeled robot on {{a production}} floor inside a factory {{by means of}} radio-frequency distance measurement and trilateration techniques. A set of radio-frequency transceivers located on the columns of the factory (anchors) create a grid with several triangular zones capable of measuring the line-of-sight distance between each anchor and the transceiver installed in the wheeled robot. After measuring only three of these distances (radii), an enhanced trilateration algorithm is applied to obtain X and Y coordinates in a Cartesian plane, i. e., {{the position of the}} robot on the factory floor. The embedded systems developed for the anchors and the robot are robust enough to establish communication, select the closest anchors for measuring radii, and identify in which of the <b>grid</b> <b>zones</b> the robot is located...|$|R

5000|$|An MGRS grid {{reference}} {{is a point}} reference system. When the term 'grid square' is used, it can refer to a square with a side length of 10 km, 1 km, 100 m, 10 m or 1 m, depending on the precision of the coordinates provided. (In some cases, squares adjacent to a <b>Grid</b> <b>Zone</b> Junction (GZJ) are clipped, so polygon is a better descriptor of these areas.) The number of digits in the numerical location must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, depending on the desired precision. When changing precision levels, {{it is important to}} truncate rather than round the easting and northing values to ensure the more precise polygon will remain within the boundaries of the less precise polygon. Related to this is the primacy of the southwest corner of the polygon being the labeling point for an entire polygon. In instances where the polygon is not a square and has been clipped by a <b>grid</b> <b>zone</b> junction, the polygon keeps the label of the southwest corner as {{if it had not been}} clipped.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the polar}} regions, a {{different}} convention is used. [...] South of 80°S, UPS South (Universal Polar Stereographic) {{is used instead}} of a UTM projection. The west half-circle forms a <b>grid</b> <b>zone</b> with designation A; the east half-circle forms one with designation B; see figure 3. North of 84°N, UPS North is used, and the west half-circle is Y, the east one is Z; see figure 4. Since the letters A, B, Y, and Z are not used for any latitude bands of UTM, their presence in an MGRS coordinate, with the omission of a zone number, indicates that the coordinates are in the UPS system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{boundaries}} of the latitude bands are parallel circles (dashed black lines in figure 1), which do not coincide with the {{boundaries of}} the 100,000-meter squares (blue lines in figure 1). For example, at the boundary between grid zones 1P and 1Q, we find a 100,000-meter square BT, of which about two thirds is south of latitude 16° and therefore in <b>grid</b> <b>zone</b> 1P, while one third is north of 16° and therefore in 1Q. So, an MGRS grid reference for a position in BT should begin with 1PBT in the south part of BT, and with 1QBT in the north part of BT. At least, this is possible if the precision of the grid reference is enough to place the denoted area completely inside either 1P or 1Q.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of an MGRS {{coordinate}} is the grid-zone designation. The 6° wide UTM zones, numbered 1-60, are intersected by latitude bands that are normally 8° high, lettered C-X (omitting I and O). The northmost latitude band, X, is 12° high. The intersection of a UTM zone and a latitude band is (normally) a 6° × 8° polygon called a <b>grid</b> <b>zone,</b> whose designation in MGRS is formed by the zone number (one or two digits - the number for zones 1 to 9 is just a single digit, according to the example in DMA TM 8358.1, Section 3-2, Figure 7), followed by the latitude band letter (uppercase). This same notation is used in both UTM and MGRS, i.e. the UTM grid reference system; the article on Universal Transverse Mercator shows many maps of these grid zones, including the irregularities for Svalbard and southwest Norway.|$|E
