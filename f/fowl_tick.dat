50|$|Argas persicus, {{also known}} as <b>fowl</b> <b>tick</b> or poultry tick, is a small soft-bodied tick that is found {{primarily}} on domestic fowl such as chickens, ducks, and geese. It was first recorded by Lorenz Oken in 1818 in Meyaneh, Persia, and named Rhynochoprion persicum.|$|E
50|$|Argas persicus, the <b>fowl</b> <b>tick,</b> {{is a major}} pest {{of poultry}} birds. The tampan ticks within Ornithodoros moubata complex of species infest {{domestic}} pigs and also feed on humans. Ornithodoros savignyi is often found in large numbers at enclosures where camels and cattle are herded.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on the epidemiology and vector role of ticks in layer chicken in Faisalabad district of Punjab(Pakistan) For epidemiological studies, prevalence of ticks on layer chicken was determined by selecting eighteen layer farms oat random: 5, 5, 3, 3 and 2 layer farms from tehsil Faisalabad, Jarawala, Sammudri, Tandianwala and chak Jhumra, respectively. Different species of ticks were collected and identified from layers. Tick infestation in layers was correlated with different factors like temperature, humidity, variety of layers, age species of ticks and the used of acraicides. The vector role of <b>fowl</b> <b>ticks</b> in the transmission of diseases was explored. For this purpose, ticks were examined natural infection with spirochaetes, bacteria and rickettsia. The vector status of different species of ticks naturally infected with spirochaetosis was confirmed through experimental transmission in healthy birds. The vector role of Argas persicus and Argas vespertilionis in the transmission of spirochaetosis in layer chicken was confirmed through isolation of Borrelia anserine form naturally infected ticks. The rate of Borrelia anserine infection in Argas persicus and Argas vespertilionis was 72. 7 and 55 percent respectively. Borrelia anserine infection in <b>fowl</b> <b>ticks</b> on different varieties of layer chick was also recorded and found to be 54, 66 and 84 per cent in the Indigenous, Babcock and White Leg Horn layers, respectively. The transmission of spriochatetosis by <b>fowl</b> <b>ticks</b> was assessed by experimental transmission in the layer chicken. Three species of bacteria namely staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella pullorum and Escherichia coli were isolated form the triturated Argas persicus and Argas vesprtilionis. The relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella pullorum and Escherichia coli in Args persicus was 80, 36. 7 and 53. 3 per cent, respectively and of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in Argas vespertilionis was 60 and 46. 6 per cent, respectively. No rickettsial Results {{of the present study}} have provided the vase line data for making new projects in the field of acarology, which would ultimately help in the control of ticks in local layer chicken...|$|R
