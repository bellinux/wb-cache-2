5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an <b>ionosphere</b> should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian <b>ionosphere</b> is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an <b>ionosphere,</b> whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the <b>ionosphere</b> of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
5|$|Venus has an {{extended}} <b>ionosphere</b> located at altitudes 120–300km. The <b>ionosphere</b> almost {{coincides with the}} thermosphere. The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero. The <b>ionosphere</b> of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130km, v2 between 140 and 160km and v3 between 200 and 250km. There may be an additional layer near 180km. The maximum electron volume density (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3m−3 is reached in the v2 layer near the subsolar point. The upper boundary of the ionosphere—ionopause is located at altitudes 220–375km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin {{from that of the}} induced magnetosphere. The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions. The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside <b>ionosphere</b> at or near the observed median level of ion densities.|$|E

5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the <b>ionosphere</b> to the plasma sheet is {{especially}} strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian <b>ionosphere</b> near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian <b>ionosphere.</b> These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the <b>ionosphere</b> is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the <b>ionosphere</b> heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

The meager {{magnetic field}} is buried within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field and would show {{only as a}} local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent.

5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth.

The use of comets as solar-wind probes is discussed, the nature of comet-solar-wind interactions is investigated, and ionization sources for cometary gases are considered.

5|$|The first {{official}} inquiries into establishing <b>ionosphere</b> research in Svalbard {{was taken by}} Leiv Harang, then head of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), in October 1950. Two similar facilities, a completed one at Kjeller and one under construction in Tromsø, had already been initiated. The proposal, regarded by Harang as primarily a military project, was initially issued to the United States. It was considered by US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who {{saw it as a}} possible excuse to populate Spitsbergen as a counter-measure to the Soviet mining communities. However, nothing came of the plans before the International Geophysical Year in 1957–58, when an <b>ionosphere</b> research station was established as Isfjord Radio and moved to Ny-Ålesund in 1963. Although unrelated to the telemetry station, this was the initiation of technology services in Ny-Ålesund.|$|E
5|$|The {{geomagnetic}} field changes on time scales from milliseconds {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the <b>ionosphere</b> (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} is {{the region}} above the <b>ionosphere</b> that {{is defined by}} the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its <b>ionosphere</b> moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the <b>ionosphere</b> to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary <b>ionosphere</b> from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense <b>ionosphere.</b> Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{photochemical}} {{processes in the}} upper atmospheres and <b>ionospheres</b> of the various bodies {{in our solar system}} (planets, moons and comets) are similar. However, there are many different factors (e. g. gas composition, energy input, gravity) which control/change the relative importance of these controlling processes. The photo-chemistry of the inner planets is reasonably well understood at this time, thus there is good agreement between model calculations and most of the observational data base. The extremely limited information that we have available on the <b>ionospheres</b> of the outer planets leads to significant uncertainties about some of the controlling processes. Some important questions (e. g. Is the charge exchange process H+ + H 2 (v>= 4) [...] > H 2 + + H important? Is water vapor influx from the rings important?) remain unanswered at this time. In cometary atmospheres the freshly evaporated parent molecules are rapidly photodissociated and photoionized, therefore most of the chemical kinetics of cometary <b>ionospheres</b> involve these rapidly moving and highly reactive ions and radicals...|$|R
