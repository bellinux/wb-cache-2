5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa <b>destructor,</b> has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{downloadable}} content packs were released. The Multiplayer Havoc Pack {{launched on}} the game's release date of August 21, 2012, and contains five characters {{for use in}} multiplayer: Perceptor, Ultra Magnus, Blast Off, Wheeljack, and Zeta Prime. It also unlocks the associated customization pieces related to these characters. The Dinobots, excluding Sludge, make up the DLC Dinobot <b>Destructor</b> Pack, released on September 11. The Insecticons, G1 Optimus, Megatron, Hound, and G2 Bruticus were released as DLC for single and multiplayer in the Massive Fury Pack on September 25. Players can also purchase specific customization pieces for their multiplayer characters via microtransactions, allowing players to access content they would otherwise have to play to unlock.|$|E
5|$|Varroa <b>destructor</b> is a {{parasitic}} mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize {{all types of}} honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{programmer}} control over their execution, it is usually recommended to avoid finalizers for any but the most trivial operations. In particular, operations often performed in <b>destructors</b> are not usually appropriate for finalizers. A common anti-pattern is to write finalizers as if they were <b>destructors,</b> which is both unnecessary and ineffectual, due to differences between finalizers and <b>destructors.</b> This is particularly common among C++ programmers, as <b>destructors</b> are heavily used in idiomatic C++, following the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom.|$|R

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa <b>destructor</b> {{remains the}} world's most {{destructive}} honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven is omnivorous, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet {{in summer}} {{contains}} {{a high proportion}} of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include spiders, millipedes, centipedes (which ravens behead before eating), grasshoppers, cicadas and caterpillars (especially of the family Noctuidae), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat yabbies (Cherax <b>destructor)</b> from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding omnivore, earthworms are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item. Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them, as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft.|$|E

25|$|Deformed wing virus (DWV) is the causative {{agent of}} the wing {{deformities}} and other body malformations typically seen in honeybee colonies that are heavily infested with the parasitic mite Varroa <b>destructor.</b> DWV {{is part of a}} complex of closely related virus strains/species that also includes Kakugo virus, Varroa <b>destructor</b> virus 1 and Egypt bee virus. This deformity can clearly be seen on the honeybee's wings in the image. The deformities are produced almost exclusively due to DWV transmission by V. <b>destructor</b> when it parasitizes pupae. Bees infected as adults remain symptom-free, although they do display behavioral changes and have reduced life expectancy. Deformed bees are rapidly expelled from the colony, leading to a gradual loss of adult bees for colony maintenance. If this loss is excessive and can no longer be compensated by the emergence of healthy bees, the colony rapidly dwindles and dies.|$|E

50|$|A key {{distinction}} is that constructors are class methods, {{as there is}} no object (class instance) available until the object is created, but the other methods (<b>destructors,</b> initializers, and finalizers) are instance methods, as an object has been created. Further, constructors and initializers may take arguments, while <b>destructors</b> and finalizers generally do not, as they are usually called implicitly.|$|R

25|$|In {{the year}} 4000 (The Daleks' Master Plan, 1965–66), {{they have an}} {{interstellar}} Dalek Empire. In this story, the Daleks form an alliance with beings from the 'Outer Galaxies' in a plot to attack the Solar System with help from its treacherous Guardian Mavic Chen, who supplies them with taranium for the Time <b>Destructor.</b> The First Doctor steals the Taranium during the final meeting on the planet Kembel, but the Daleks pursue him through time and space. They finally recover the Taranium {{and turn on the}} delegates, leading to Mavic Chen's death. However, the surviving delegates are released and go back to their own galaxies to warn them of the Daleks. The Doctor activates the Time <b>Destructor</b> and the Daleks are destroyed, though his companion Sara Kingdom is turned to dust.|$|E

As a result, she and the Doctor are both caught in the field of the Time <b>Destructor</b> as it rapidly ages everything around it. While the Doctor, being a Time Lord, can withstand the worst of the effects—merely becoming an even older man—Sara, being human, cannot. As Steven watches helplessly, Sara ages (being portrayed as an old woman by May Warden) and dies, her remains aging to dust. Steven attempts to rescue his friends; he, too, is briefly affected and ages, before he reverses the Time <b>Destructor.</b> This rejuvenates himself and the Doctor back to their previous ages, but does not save Sara.|$|E
