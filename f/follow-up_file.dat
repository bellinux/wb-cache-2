40|$|Psoriasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} cutaneous diseases, the prevalence of psoriasis in population is around 2 - 3 %. Diagnosis is based on typical manifestation, anamnesis and histopathological examination. Effectality is assessed by localization, course and measure of the disease. Plaque psoriasis appears as raised areas covered with silvery white scaly skin. T-lymphocytes play the most important role in immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. There is a prevalence of Th 1 lymphocytes. Genetics factors have a role in predisposition to disease. Psoriasis is associated with the alleles from the MHC. In the treatment of psoriasis is usually used topical and systemic therapy and phototherapy. Biologic treatment of psoriasis is now possible due to the method of molecular genetic. We determine concetrations of sCD 28, sCD 30, endoglin, MCP- 1, Apo- 1 /fas and Fas ligand by ELISA. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>file</b> was made by 38 patients. We investigated importance of these markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of psoriasis. We detected that Apo- 1 /fas and sCD 28 are suitable markers for assignation of diagnosis, while Fas ligand, sCD 30 and endoglin may be used for monitoring of disease and evaluation the effectivity of therapy...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{objective}} was to test the association of cystatin C (Cys-C) with long-term mortality risk in the subjects with normal creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). BackgroundCys-C has been proposed as a sensitive indicator of renal dysfunction {{that is associated with}} cardiovascular events. The predictive value of Cys-C for mortality risk (both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular) and its utility among persons with normal kidney function remains unclear. MethodsThe analysis included 2, 990 subjects over 40 years of age with normal eGFR who participated in NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). Normal eGFR was defined by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation ≥ 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Serum Cys-C was categorized as high, medium, or low. In 1 analysis, the high and low groups were the top and bottom 10 %, and in the second analysis, they were the upper and lower thirds. All-cause and cause-specific mortality were obtained from the NHANES III–linked <b>follow-up</b> <b>file</b> through December 31, 2006. Multivariate Cox regression models were applied to assess the association of interest. ResultsWithin an average of 13. 7 years follow-up, 488 cardiovascular and 719 noncardiovascular deaths occurred. When the first and last deciles were compared, the relative risks were all increased statistically as follows: all-cause, 4. 36 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 52 to 7. 82); cardiovascular, 7. 44 (95 % CI: 3. 06 to 18. 1); cancer, 2. 45 (95 % CI: 0. 85 to 7. 04); and noncardiovascular 3. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 53 to 6. 49) mortalities. Relative risks all moderated to lower values when the comparisons were expanded to include the upper and lower thirds. Similar associations were still present when Cys-C was modeled on a continuous scale, suggesting a linear relationship between Cys-C and mortality outcomes. ConclusionsSerum Cys-C is prognostic of long-term mortality in the subjects with relatively normal renal function, independent of MDRD eGFR and albuminuria...|$|E

5000|$|Anderson's {{history of}} {{domestic}} violence accusations was extensively documented in filings obtained by the New York Daily News. According to the filings, he had been married to another woman for eleven years before their marriage ended in 1996. In January 1997, the ex-wife filed a petition for a domestic violence restraining order against him. In the petition, she claimed that Anderson had threatened to kill her, their three sons, and himself, then later threatened to kidnap their children. In a <b>follow-up</b> <b>filing,</b> the woman claimed that Anderson had assaulted {{her in front of}} his sister after he dropped off their children. She reported the assault to police, but did not let officers arrest him in front of their sons. According to her, Anderson later [...] "talked" [...] her into dropping the restraining order, but continued to verbally abuse her afterwards. Their divorce was finalized later in 1997. In 2013, a former live-in girlfriend won a three-year restraining order after claiming that Anderson assaulted her on two occasions, one of which nearly killed her.|$|R

40|$|Background: Valvular {{disease can}} course with heart failure (HF), anemia and renal {{dysfunction}} (RD), increasing the nutritional risk and worsening patient prognosis. Objective: To evaluate {{the prevalence of}} anemia and RD in patients with valvulopathy with or without HF, as well as establish a correlation with the nutritional status. Methods: A total of 104 patients admitted at the Clinic of Valvulopathy of PROCAPE/UPE, {{during the period of}} Aug-Oct/ 2008. The data were obtained from the nutritional and medical <b>follow-up</b> <b>files.</b> The collected variables were: sex, age, nutritional status according to the body mass index (BMI), presence of HF, anemia and RD. Anemia was considered when hemoglobin values were < 13 g/dl in men and < 12 g/dl in women. RD was established according to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and it was calculated through the formula proposed by Cockcroft and Gault. Results: The prevalence of anemia and RD was 71. 1 % and 68. 8 %, and 48. 1 % and 60. 0 %, in patients with and without HF, respectively, with a statistically significant difference for anemia (p = 0. 022). Of the patients, 48. 1 % were eutrophic, 26. 9 % had excess weight and 25. 0 % presented some degree of malnutrition. The patients with HF presented a higher frequency of low weight (p = 0. 020).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveDuring {{pulmonary}} resections for non–small cell lung cancer, the {{pulmonary vein}} is traditionally interrupted first to prevent seeding of malignant cells and consequently decrease metastatic implantation. This hypothesis was never confirmed scientifically. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine whether the sequence of vessel interruption during lobectomy (lobar vein or lobar artery first) affects disease recurrence. MethodsA historical prospective study was performed of 279 consecutive patients with complete follow-up, who survived lobectomy for non–small cell lung cancer during 1992 to 1998, in a single center. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were collected from the medical records; recurrence and vital status were obtained from <b>follow-up</b> <b>files,</b> central population registry, and personal confirmation, updated to December 2000. Comparison of recurrence rates by sequence of ligation and other independent variables was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. ResultsA total of 133 patients (48 %) had vein interruption before the artery (V-first) and 146 (52 %) had artery interruption first (A-first). The distribution of demographic, clinical, and other characteristics was similar between the 2 groups, except for the operated side and performing surgeons. The morbidity, blood requirement, and length of stay were equal for both groups. The total recurrence rate (A-first, 53 %; V-first, 51 %) was similar. Multivariate analysis (controlling for the effect of the performing surgeon) revealed elevated risk for recurrence among patients with high disease stage (odds ratio = 2. 54), male gender (odds ratio = 1. 59), intraoperative lung manipulation (odds ratio = 2. 72), and blood transfusion (odds ratio = 1. 49). Sequence of vessel interruption was not found as a risk factor for recurrence (odds ratio = 1. 29; 95 % 0. 73 to 2. 29, P =. 4). ConclusionsOur results did not show that sequence of vessel interruption during lobectomy plays a role in tumor recurrence. A prospective study with randomization in selection of method as well as surgeons for each patient is needed to confirm these results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Investigate {{levels of}} {{retention}} at specified time periods along {{the prevention of}} mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) cascade among mother-infant pairs as well as individual- and facility-level factors associated with retention. Methods: A retrospective cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants attending five health centres from November 2010 to February 2012 in the Option B programme in Rwanda was established. Data were collected from several health registers and patient <b>follow-up</b> <b>files.</b> Additionally, informant interviews were conducted to ascertain health facility characteristics. Generalized estimating equation methods and modelling were utilized to estimate the number of mothers attending each antenatal care visit and assess factors associated with retention. Results: Data from 457 pregnant women and 462 infants were collected at five different health centres (three urban and two rural facilities). Retention at 30 days after registration and retention at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-delivery were analyzed. Based on an analytical sample of 348, we found that 58 % of women and 81 % of infants were retained in care within the same health facility at 12 months post-delivery, respectively. However, for mother-infant paired mothers, retention at 12 months was 74 % and 79 % for their infants. Loss to facility occurred early, with 26 % to 33 % being lost within 30 days post-registration. In a multivariable model retention was associated with being married, adjusted relative risk (ARR) : 1. 26, (95 % confidence intervals: 1. 11, 1. 43); antiretroviral therapy eligible, ARR: 1. 39, (1. 12, 1. 73) and CD 4 count per 50 mm 3, ARR: 1. 02, (1. 01, 1. 03). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate varying retention levels among mother-infant pairs along the PMTCT cascade in addition to potential determinants of retention to such programmes. Unmarried, apparently healthy, HIV-positive pregnant women need additional support for programme retention. With the significantly increased workload resulting from lifelong antiretroviral treatment for all HIV-positive pregnant women, strategies {{need to be developed}} to identify, provide support and trace these women at risk of loss to follow-up. This study provides further evidence for the need for such a targeted supportive approach...|$|R

Methods: Prospective population-based cohort study among 6, 370 elderly subjects. At baseline study participants were examined for presence of diabetes mellitus. Nondemented participants were followed up, on average, for 2. 1 years. Incident dementia was diagnosed using a three-step screening and comprehensive diagnostic workup. To complete the <b>follow-up,</b> medical <b>files</b> were studied of persons who could not be reexamined. We estimated relative risks with proportional hazard regression, adjusting for age, sex, and possible confounders. Results: During the follow-up, 126 patients became demented, of whom 89 had AD. Diabetes mellitus almost doubled the risk of dementia (relative risk [RR] 1. 9 [1. 3 to 2. 8]) and AD (RR 1. 9 [1. 2 to 3. 1]). Patients treated with insulin were at highest risk of dementia (RR 4. 3 [1. 7 to 10. 5]).

40|$|Aim: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by increased activity of GABA in basal ganglia {{and the loss of}} dopamine in nigrostriatum, associated with rigidity, resting tremor, gait with accelerating steps, and fixed inexpressive face. (1) Current treatments mostly aim to have the symptoms under control. The treatment of the disease can be done accurately when it is integrated with especially patient compliance and all sub-disciplines of pharmacology like drug interactions, pharmacovigilance and pharmacoeconomy. It is aimed in this study to analyse the age when the disease was determined, comorbid diseases, drug use and adverse effects in patients who were diagnosed Parkinson disease and whose treatment already started and to research the Vitamin B 12, TSH, Triglyceride, Folic Acid levels that are related with the disease in the literature. Method: The study was conducted on 111 patients who had applied to Kutahya Dumlupinar University Medical Faculty Evliya Celebi Education and Research Hospital between 2006 and 2013 and were diagnosed Parkinson disease. The following data of the patients- age, gender, drugs having been used, treatments related with the comorbid diseases, adverse effects, B 12 vitamin values in the files of 44 patients, their Triglyceride levels, TSH and Folic acid levels- were reviewed retrospectively from their <b>follow-up</b> <b>files.</b> Findings: The participants of the study were 111 subjects diagnosed Parkinson disease and 47 of them (42, 3 %) were female while 64 (57, 7 %) were male. The age range during which the disease was seen frequently was (65 - 74) and the age average was 64 (25 - 86). 107 (96, 3 %) of the 111 subjects were started with antiparkinson treatment. In terms of the comorbid diseases to Parkinson, no comorbid diseases were determined in 78 (70, 2 %) of the 111 patients while depression was seen in 8 (% 24, 4) subjects, hypothyroidis was seen in 13 (39, 4 %) subjects, DM was seen in 7 (21, 2 %) subjects, hyperlipidaemia was seen in 2 (6, 2 %) subjects. 40 (36 %) of the patients didn't use any additional drugs, but additional drug use was determined in 71 (63 %) patients. In terms of the data of the 44 patients, whose laboratory data could be obtained, it was found that that on average B 12 value was 412. 53 and TSH value was 1. 48 while Folate value was 9. 35 and TG value was 131. 56. In these 44 patients, B 12 value of 32 (73 %) patients, TSH value of 24 (55 %) patients, Folate value of 30 (68 %) patients were low, whereas TG value of 23 (47 %) was low. Discussion and Conclusion: Rational drug use is extremely crucial in the treatment of Parkinson disease. One of the most important factors in the treatment success is compliance with the treatment. A careful follow up of folate, B 12, TSH, Triglyceride levels related to the disease in the literature in patients diagnosed Parkinson disease and taking the required precautions will provide synergistic contribution to the treatment success.

Patients and Methods: A total 48 women with SUI underwent the TOT procedure during the period from December 2005 to February 2008. The follow-up period ranged between 60 and 84 months (mean 71 months). Mean age was 44. 21 ± 7. 52 (range: 30 - 58). Preoperative and early postoperative data were retrieved from the patient′s medical <b>files.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> evaluation was carried out every 3 months during the 1 st year and yearly afterwards by history taking (including incontinence and quality-of-life questionnaire), clinical examination, urine analysis, abdominopelvic ultrasonography, and urodynamic studies when indicated. Results: At 12 -month follow-up, the cure, improvement, and failure rates were 39 patients (81. 25 %), 5 (10. 42 %) and 4 (8. 33 %), respectively. The corresponding rates at the last follow-up were 38 (79. 15 %), 5 (10. 42 %) and 5 (10. 42 %) respectively.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Clinical Psychology (MClinPsych) The {{prediction}} {{and subsequent}} management of aggression in psychiatric inpatients {{is a crucial}} role of the mental health professional. This retrospective cohort study combines a critical literature review and a research paper {{on the ability of}} static and dynamic risk assessment measures to predict aggression in psychiatric inpatients in the short- to medium-term. The critical literature review presents an overview of the development of static and dynamic risk assessment measures before critically discussing the research on violence prediction in psychiatric inpatient populations over the short- to medium-term. The research paper examines the predictive validity of 10 static and dynamic risk of violence measures and subscales in 37 forensic and 37 civil inpatients residing in a medium-to-low security psychiatric facility over 1 -, 3 -, and 6 -month <b>follow-up</b> periods. Retrospective <b>file</b> records were sourced to conduct an AUC analysis of the ROC curve for short and medium follow-up periods to test the ability of each measure to predict interpersonal violence, verbal threat, and any aggression. The hypothesis that dynamic measures would be better predictors than static measures over the short-term was supported. Albeit to a lesser extent, dynamic measures were still better predictors than static measures over the medium-term. This result was seen in both civil and forensic groups. Three previously untested measures were found to predict aggression within the sample. It is recommended that mental health services employ the use of dynamic measures when making short-term risk of violence predictions for civil and/or forensic inpatients...|$|R
