The first half of the heptathlon saw two athletes set a world heptathlon best: Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam and Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson both cleared [...] for the high jump.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found {{at the end of my}} account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other things.|$|E

First he moved his paws, and soon they saw him rise on his feet. The old man shared the fate of the first, for they now heard his cries as he was torn in pieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them. Not yet discouraged, the young men kept on their way; but the bear was now so close, that the leader once more applied to his brothers, but they could do nothing. 'Well,' said he, 'my dreams will soon be exhausted; after this I have but one more.' He advanced, invoking his guardian spirit to aid him. 'Once,' said he, 'I dreamed that, being sorely pressed, I came to a large lake, on the shore of which was a canoe, partly out of water, having ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,' he cried, 'we shall soon get it.' And so it was, even as he had said. Coming to the lake, they saw the canoe with ten paddles, and immediately they embarked. Scarcely had they reached the center of the lake, when they saw the bear arrive at its borders. Lifting himself on his hind legs, he looked all around. Then he waded into the water; then losing his footing he turned back, and commenced making the circuit of the lake. Meantime the party remained stationary in the center to watch his movements. He traveled all around, till at last he came to the place from whence he started. Then he commenced drinking up the water, and they saw the current <b>fast</b> <b>setting</b> in towards his open mouth. The leader encouraged them to paddle hard for the opposite shore. When only a short distance from land, the current had increased so much, that they were drawn back by it, and all their efforts to reach it were in vain.|$|E

40|$|Background: Indonesia is a {{tropical}} country with temperature variation. A lot of dental clinics {{do not use}} air conditioner. The room temperature influences water temperature for mixing alginate impression materials. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the functional relationship of room temperature and initial setting time of alginate impression materials. Methods: The New Kromopan® alginate (normal and <b>fast</b> <b>sets)</b> were used. The initial setting time were tested at 23 (control), 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 degrees Celcius room temperatures (n = 5). The initial setting time was tested based on ANSI/ADA Specification no. 18 (ISO 1563). The alginate powder was mixed with distilled water (23 / 50 ratio), put in the metal ring mould, and the initial setting time was measured by test rod. Data were statistically analyzed by linear regression (α = 0. 05). result: The initial setting times were 149. 60 ± 0. 55 (control) and 96. 40 ± 0. 89 (31 ° C) seconds for normal set, and 122. 00 ± 1. 00 (control) and 69. 60 ± 0. 55 (31 ° C) seconds for <b>fast</b> <b>set.</b> The coefficient of determination of room temperature to initial setting time of alginate were R 2 = 0. 74 (normal set) and R 2 = 0. 88 (<b>fast</b> <b>set).</b> The regression equation for normal set was Y = 257. 6 – 5. 5 X (p < 0. 01) and <b>fast</b> <b>set</b> was Y = 237. 7 – 5. 6 X (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The room temperature gave high contribution and became a strength predictor for initial setting time of alginates.

40|$|I {{have some}} {{difficulty}} in using MTA {{because of its}} slow setting time. How can I make the MTA set faster or regulate the setting time?Q MTA is used widely in endodontic treatment as a pulp capping material, root-end filling material, and perforation repair. 1 Although MTA has many favorable properties, long setting time is a clinical disadvantage. To overcome this problem many studies were performed. Hydration accelerators, such as citric acid, lactic acid, calcium chloride, and calcium lactate gluconate, were added during the mixing of MTA. In our previous study, hydration accelerators improved the setting time but the compressive strength decreased. 2 In the cytotoxicity test, citric acid and calcium lactate gluconate showed favorable biocompatibility, while calcium chloride showed lower cell viability. 3 Therefore, addition {{of these kinds of}} hydration accelerators to MTA fastens the setting time of MTA. Recently, <b>fast</b> <b>setting</b> MTA like materials, such as Biodentine, was introduced. Biodentine showed <b>fast</b> <b>setting</b> time and higher compressive strength compared to MTA.
