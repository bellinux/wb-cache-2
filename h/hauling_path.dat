(This {{should not be confused with}} the later divert that went through the village itself.) In 1849 a boatman named Butler was jailed for a week for ‘obstructing a train on the line of the Great Northern Railway at Skellingthorpe, on the 1st September, by using it as a <b>hauling</b> <b>path,</b> in towing a boat up the Foss’.|$|E
40|$|Groundfish that {{associate}} with rugged seafloor types {{are difficult to}} assess with bottom-trawl sampling gear. Simrad ME 70 multibeam echosounder (MBES) data and video imagery were collected to characterize trawlable and untrawlable areas, and to ultimately improve efforts to determine habitat-specific groundfish biomass. The data were collected during two acoustic-trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) during 2011 and 2012 by NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) researchers. MBES data were collected continuously along the trackline, which included parallel transects (1 - 20 nmi spacing) and fine-scale survey locations in 2011. Video data were collected at camera stations using a drop camera system. Multibeamderived seafloor metrics were overlaid with the locations of previously conducted AFSC bottomtrawl (BT) survey hauls and 2011 camera stations. Generalized linear models were used to identify the best combination of multibeam metrics to discriminate between trawlable and untrawlable seafloor for the region of overlap between the camera stations or <b>haul</b> <b>paths</b> and the MBES data. The most discriminatory models were chosen based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The two best models were developed using data collected at camera stations with either oblique incidence backscatter strength (Sb) or mosaic Sb in combination with bathymetric position index and seafloor ruggedness and described over 54...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Up till now, {{traditional}} methods of planning construction projects such as 2 D technologies including bar charts, network diagrams and other scheduling tools, which are typical methods for modeling the progress of a project, {{have been the only}} methods considered. These planning tools are incapable of acknowledging different aspects of construction projects, that it to say, they ignore the space requirements, in which activities are executed and the impact of weather on construction processes. This leads to drawbacks during the execution of these tasks such as work area overlapping, reduction in productivity, safety hazards, long <b>hauling</b> <b>paths</b> and poor quality of work. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} acknowledge the requirements of spatial aspects and the impact of weather, and to integrate these requirements into one simulation framework model. We propose a constraints-based simulation framework. That is to say, the simulation framework executes only tasks, which satisfy the requirement of the space availability and sensitivity towards weather conditions. The implementation of the multi-layer decision support system for construction operations was carried out in Plant Simulation environment and the Simulation Toolkit Shipbuilding (STS) Tool Box Component. This concept will assist site managers in planning and updating the near-term activities for the exterior construction work of high rise buildings. This is on-going research; therefore, other aspects such as execution strategies for different tasks will be developed in a future approach. This research contributes a new approach to integrating different construction problems in one simulation model, which have not been much considered in previous work.

40|$|Groundfish that {{associate}} with rugged seafloor types {{are difficult to}} assess with bottom-trawl sampling gear. Simrad ME 70 multibeam echosounder (ME 70) data and video imagery were collected to characterize trawlable and untrawlable areas and to ultimately improve efforts to determine habitat-specific groundfish biomass. We surveyed areas of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) (20 - 500 m depth) aboard the NOAA ship Oscar Dyson during 2011, from the Islands of Four Mountains in the Aleutians to eastern Kodiak Island. Additional ME 70 data were collected opportunistically during the winter 2012 acoustic trawl surveys. ME 70 data were collected continuously along the ship trackline (1 - 20 nmi spacing) and at fine-scale survey locations in 2011 with 100 % seafloor coverage (n = 21). Video data were collected at fine-scale survey sites using a drop camera (n = 47 stations). ME 70 data were matched to the spatial location of previously conducted AFSC bottom-trawl survey hauls (n = 582) and 2011 camera stations to discriminate between trawlable and untrawlable seafloor types {{in the region of}} overlap between the <b>haul</b> or camera <b>path</b> and the ME 70 data. Angle-dependent backscatter strength, backscatter mosaics, and other multibeam metrics were extracted from the ME 70 data at these locations. Haul locations show separation in backscatter strength based on performance, previously classified as successful or unsuccessful due to gear damage from contact with the seafloor. Successful haul locations have values that correspond to finer grainsize, or the lack of untrawlable features such as boulders and rock. A similar pattern was observed for the camera stations characterized as trawlable or untrawlable from video. The best descriptors for seafloor trawlability will be identified among multibeam metrics to map the predicted trawlability of the ME 70 survey footprint. Continued opportunistic collection of ME 70 data during Oscar Dyson operations will help refine existing classifications of untrawlable and trawlable areas in the GOA...|$|R
