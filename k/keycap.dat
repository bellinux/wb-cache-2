2500|$|Initially, {{sublimation}} printing, where {{a special}} ink is printed onto the <b>keycap</b> {{surface and the}} application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or [...] "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>keycap</b> is a {{small plastic}} cover placed over the {{keyswitch}} of a computer keyboard. Keycaps are illustrated to indicate the [...] or alphanumeric character they correspond to. Early keyboards were manufactured with the keyswitch and <b>keycap</b> integrated in one unit; separate keycaps were introduced to facilitate the production of different keyboard layouts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Keycaps</b> are can {{be bought}} in {{replacement}} sets for a keyboard. Notably, replacement sets are frequently sold for keyboards that use the Cherry MX-style stems. Custom sets are bought and sold within the enthusiast communities, and artisan <b>keycaps</b> can be purchased individually.|$|R

50|$|The {{top of a}} <b>keycap</b> may be {{described}} as cylinder-shaped (curving to the sides as if a fat cylinder was resting on it), flat or spherical (curving to the top, bottom and sides as if a large sphere was resting on it). The modern preference is for cylinder-shaped keycaps rather than spherical ones, but laptop keys are often flat.|$|E
2500|$|The variant most {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Model M" [...] is Part No. 1391401, on which many other variants were based. This Enhanced Keyboard model included IBM's patented buckling spring design and swappable <b>keycaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Keytops {{are used}} on full-travel keyboards. While modern <b>keycaps</b> are {{typically}} surface-printed, {{they can also}} be double-shot molded, laser printed, sublimation printed, engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts.|$|R

50|$|Typical keycaps of the 1970s and 1980s were {{produced}} using two-shot molding, with the markings molded into each <b>keycap</b> {{in a different}} color of plastic, but this eventually fell out of favor, as it was more expensive (particularly in tooling costs), and tended to produce keycaps more durable than the equipment on which they were mounted. Modern keycaps are usually labelled by stamping or laser engraving. However, two-shot molding ("Doubleshot") keycaps are purchasable today, known for their feel and general durability.|$|E
50|$|Many modern icons have {{a maximum}} size of 1024 by 1024 pixels or greater. The {{challenge}} of icon design {{is to create}} an image that is communicative, beautiful, and understandable, at every size from this maximum resolution down to the minimum resolution of 16 by 16 pixels. Many icon formats allow one icon to include hinting to ensure visual clarity at smaller resolutions, or even completely different subsidiary images for smaller sizes (for instance, a keyboard at larger sizes, and a single <b>keycap</b> at smaller ones).|$|E
50|$|The name {{refers to}} the fact that the coil spring tensed between the <b>keycap</b> and a {{pivoting}} hammer buckles, i.e. kinks or collapses, at a certain point in its downward traverse, providing auditory and tactile feedback to the keyboard operator. Upon buckling, the hammer is pivoted forward by the spring and strikes an electrical contact which registers the key press. In a Model M, the electrical contact is a membrane sheet similar to that of a modern dome switch keyboard. On the older Model F design, a capacitive contact was used instead.|$|E

50|$|The first iteration, {{released}} in 2005, did not feature mechanical keyswitches, {{but in addition}} to the blank <b>keycaps,</b> it featured a Model-M-inspired design, and individually weighted keypresses, because some keys are pressed with less force than other keys.|$|R
50|$|A {{well-known}} {{class of}} IBM PC keyboards is the Model M. Introduced in 1986 and manufactured by IBM, Lexmark, Maxi-Switch and Unicomp, {{the vast majority}} of Model M keyboards feature a buckling spring key design and many have fully swappable <b>keycaps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{special case}} of the {{computer}} keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys {{are attached to the}} keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a [...] "scissor"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [...] 'scissors' mechanism links the <b>keycap</b> to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2 mm instead of 3.5 - 4 mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.|$|E
5000|$|When a Teletype 33 ASR {{equipped}} with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, [...] "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume. This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a [...] "handshaking" [...] signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q {{is replaced by a}} second Control-S to resume output. The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units {{equipped with}} this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the <b>keycap</b> above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.|$|E

50|$|Two {{decades later}} the term instead {{describes}} low-profile, low-travel scissor keyboards with simplified, flat <b>keycaps</b> {{separated by a}} bezel. Sony was the first modern laptop manufacturer {{to make use of}} this keyboard style with the release of the VAIO X505 in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Printing of numbers, letters, {{and symbols}} on the <b>keycaps</b> are done using pad {{printing}}, laser etching, or dye sublimation.Pad printing is the cheapest and most common.Dye sublimination {{is more expensive}} and only done by a few companies such as Topre, ZF Electronics, and Unicomp.|$|R
50|$|Sharp {{also built}} OEM {{versions}} of the QT-8D for the Swedish office machine company Facit and its subsidiary Addo, which sold them as the Facit 1115 and the Addo-X 9354. These had the same internals as the QT-8D but used a different case and <b>keycaps.</b>|$|R
