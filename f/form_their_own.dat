5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> groups. A loose association between individuals {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep away from one another.|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was {{not strong enough to}} break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August, Tsipras {{announced}} {{the resignation of}} the Syriza-ANEL government, and that a legislative election was scheduled for 20 September. Tsakalotos {{and the rest of the}} cabinet remained as lame duck ministers whilst opposition parties attempted to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> government. However, the opposition parties failed to form a government and Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou was appointed as an interim Prime Minister on 27 August. On 28 August, Thanou-Christophilou's caretaker cabinet was sworn in, with George Chouliarakis being sworn in as the interim Minister of Finance.|$|E

Waters {{switched to the}} bass and by January 1964, the group {{became known as the}} Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{teenagers}} who {{were interested in}} Wicca had begun hanging around at the Warlock Shop, and they too were initiated into the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, after gaining parental permission. Proceeding through the outer court of Buczynski's coven, they eventually hived off to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> coven, the Children of Branwen, in December 1972, with prominent members including Robert Carey, Denny Sargent, and Karen and Eddie Chiecho. Buczynski initially attended some of the group's meetings, in order to instruct these students in the Craft, but soon found his time preoccupied with his own primary coven, leaving the coven under the control of high priestess Kay Smith. She would subsequently go on to found a Welsh Traditionalist coven for adults, leaving the position of high priestess to Melda Tamarack.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna {{are still}} on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they accidentally kill three more people, a mechanic, a shop {{assistant}} and a policeman. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the only option is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea. Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, as in The Lord of the Flies. They <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1153 Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Durham by the cathedral chapter, in spite of the {{opposition}} of Henry Murdac, who excommunicated the chapter in response. Because of Murdac's opposition and refusal to confirm the election, Hugh only obtained consecration by making a personal visit to Rome, where the pope was able to over-rule the Archbishop of York. He was consecrated on 20 December 1153, by Pope Anastasius IV. Hugh was enthroned, or ceremonially installed as bishop in his cathedral, at Durham on 2 May 1154. King Stephen granted to Puiset as bishop of Durham, the mineral rights at Weardale, which included lead mines. Silver was also extracted from the lead ore mined there, and that silver probably helped the bishops <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> mint.|$|E
50|$|Round Table {{itself was}} formed in 1927, a social {{networking}} and community group exclusively for men aged under 40.

Like Round Table, Ladies Circle was specifically intended for younger ladies, and so was only open to under 40s.

5|$|The German {{military}} had pioneered using airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed {{by the success}} of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, {{as well as a number}} of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. When the equipment to be used by the airborne forces was under development, War Office officials decided that gliders would be an integral component, to transport troops and heavy equipment.|$|E
5|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh {{movement}} that had originally begun in Armenia {{during the late}} 1980s called for the Karabakh enclave to be united with that country, despite it being behind the borders of Azerbaijan. With a population that was 75 percent Armenian, official petitions were sent by Armenian leaders to the Soviet government in Moscow {{in order to address}} the issue but were rejected by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The demands to annex the region came in the middle of Gorbachev's reform policies, Glasnost and Perestroika. First implemented in 1985, when Gorbachev came into power, the liberalization of political and economical constraints in the Soviet Union gave birth to numerous nationalist groups in the different Soviet republics who insisted that they be given the right to secede and <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> independent countries.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales Rugby League {{competition}} (NSWRL) {{had been}} formed in 1908 {{as the first}} rugby league competition in Australia. There was a Newcastle based club {{in the first two}} seasons of the Sydney-based competition, but they eventually left to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> Newcastle Rugby League competition. It was not until 1988 that another Newcastle based team was admitted into the NSWRL. In 1995, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) took control of the competition amid the beginning of the Super League war. It was then that News Limited began proposing and deliberating a rival rugby league competition and the twenty teams which competed in the 1995 ARL season were split between the Super League and ARL competitions.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} promoted Dostana {{in collaboration}} with Verve, which dedicated its November issue to the film. The issue, with Chopra on its cover, contained 40 pages of interviews with the actress, Mansukhani and Johar, fashion shoots on the sets, clothing by its designers and fashion and beauty articles based on the film. Although Maybelline products were not used for Chopra's make-up, the company promoted Chopra's appearance with behind-the-scenes footage in their television and print advertisements and invited its customers to mirror the actress. The producers collaborated with Facebook, which featured advertisements {{with each of the}} three lead actors urging users to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> group. Pantaloons partnered with the film to showcase its apparel in 43 outlets across India.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams of}} dust and gas each <b>form</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
