40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of MPs' <b>expense</b> <b>claims</b> and of their attendance at Parliamentary meetings. Using a multiple regression framework, we correlate the expenses with three sets of variables: constituency characteristics, political variables, and individual characteristics. We then look at the ratio of parliamentary <b>expenses</b> <b>claimed</b> to votes cast in Parliament as a crude measure of value for money. This take on the data provides a somewhat benign view of the usage of <b>expense</b> <b>claims.</b> We use the results to reflect on two views of the motivation of MPs-the public choice view and the public service view...|$|R
