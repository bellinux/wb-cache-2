5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> (AFDC).

Because of this, many European countries are developing representative domestic schedules to replace outdated criteria. This paper evaluates the state of knowledge of UK domestic occupancy patterns and develops new domestic occupancy profiles for England. The presented research (1) characterizes methods for collecting occupancy data and inferring patterns; (2) identifies and assesses the quality of categories of occupancy patterns used in building simulation; and (3) develops updated occupancy profiles. A systematic scoping review identified social and monitoring surveys as the most deployed data-collection methods. A systematic literature review also established that the occupancy categories most frequently used in UK building simulation are (a) a <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> where the parents work full time; and (b) a retired elderly couple who {{spend most of their}} time indoors. The interview sample from the English Housing Survey 2014 – 15 was used to map household typologies. Results show that categories (a) and (b) combined amount to only 19 % of England’s households, which suggest models are over-reliant on these groups. Considering this result, the paper develops occupancy patterns for England derived from 2015 UK Time Use Survey diaries for each household typology previously identified...|$|R
50|$|In 1975, a basic tax-free cash {{allowance}} {{starting at}} £665 {{for children under}} the age of ten provided a considerable amount of support for families living on low incomes, and its combination with direct taxation meant greater support to poor families than in any other country in the EEC. A two-parent <b>family</b> <b>with</b> four <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> on 66% of average earnings gained an amount after tax and allowances equal to 49.4% of its income compared with 8.2% in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, that same year, INSEE found that at any wage level disposable income per head was still much lower in large <b>families</b> than those <b>with</b> no or very few children, while the cost of bringing up a family weighed particularly heavily on households headed by a low-paid worker.

2500|$|In 1992, {{the state}} of California enacted a statute {{limiting}} the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. At the time, California was paying the sixth-largest welfare benefits in the United States. In a move to reduce the state welfare budget, the California State Legislature enacted a statute (Cal.

In order to avoid these outcomes, Gingrich supports {{what he calls a}} [...] "replacement approach" [...] to entitlement reform. He argues that entitlement programs need fundamental restructuring in order to strengthen incentives for work and productivity. Gingrich cites the reform of Aid to <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> passed in the 1990s as a model for future policymaking. Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of guaranteed employment for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance.|$|E

In December 1973, he signed the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, establishing a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of HMOs.|$|R

2500|$|As anthropologists embraced [...] "mode of production" [...] {{analysis}} in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about [...] "pre-capitalist" [...] societies, other than to define them by what they were not. One of the first attempts to theorize Hunter-gatherer society was Marshall Sahlins Stone Age Economics (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as [...] "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in [...] "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies. Richard B. Lee's work amongst the Dobe !Kung of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even {{in one of the}} most hostile desert environments. The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a [...] "Domestic mode of production." [...] Given the argument of the [...] "original affluent society" [...] that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young <b>families</b> <b>with</b> many <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> had to work harder, whereas older <b>families</b> <b>with</b> mature children and many workers worked much less. The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.|$|R

2500|$|Recent debates have {{centered}} {{on the need for}} policies that focus on both [...] "income poverty" [...] and [...] "asset poverty." [...] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as Aid to <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Children</b> (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED , 27 percent of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are living in [...] "asset poverty." [...] These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program {{under the supervision of the}} US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.|$|E
30|$|Being {{a female}} gambler living <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> was {{associated}} <b>with</b> over {{five times the}} odds of also being a victim of family violence amongst help-seeking gamblers, compared to male gamblers without <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> Importantly, this finding remained even after sociodemographic and psychosocial factors known {{to be associated with}} violence were adjusted for, and once gambling factors were considered. Our final adjusted estimate of the odds was that females <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> were six times more likely than males without <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> to be victims of family violence (Model 4, Table  5). The persistence of this effect, despite adjustment for known contextual factors, indicates a strong gender dimension to the effect of having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> on being a victim of family violence among gamblers. Why is it that females living <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> are especially vulnerable? This question warrants further research in regard to the particular gendered social and psychological processes at work, and highlights the necessity for interventions to reduce victimisation that involve female gamblers <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> In this study, over two-thirds of female gambler participants <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> lived in homes where violence was occurring; 68 % where violence was perpetrated by the female gambler, and 77 % where the female gambler was a victim of violence. Thus, children in such homes were subject to an environment with violence occurring.|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} shown that the {{relationship}} between having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and being a victim of family violence was gender-related, with female gamblers living <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> reporting more <b>family</b> violence perpetration and victimisation than male gamblers living <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> Additionally, female gamblers <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> had greater odds of being a victim of family violence than male gamblers without <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> The implications of this finding are that children living in homes where the mother is a gambler, have a higher risk of living in a household within which family violence is occurring, increasing their vulnerability to poorer health outcomes. Thus, as a harm minimisation measure, it would be prudent for a coordinated approach to be developed between different health and social service sectors for potential early identification of family violence. In particular, it would be useful for gambling treatment services to routinely screen for family violence, particularly in households <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> so that clients can be facilitated, as necessary, to relevant family violence services for assistance. Conversely, family violence services may benefit from screening for problematic gambling. In an ideal world, there would be a collaborative inter-agency and case management approach in order to identify family violence amongst people, particularly those <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> who are affected by gambling problems; this could improve the prospects and outcomes for those people.|$|R

However, once psychosocial factors were also taken into account, this effect disappeared. This suggests {{that it is not the}} combination of female gender and having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> per se that is related to increased violence perpetration but the association of that combination with other contextual factors that leads to the higher risk for perpetrating family violence. In their Australian study, Dowling et al. (2014) discuss their findings of elevated odds of victimisation, and combined victimisation and perpetration among female gamblers commenting that “this group of service users should be specifically targeted for screening, assessment and management” (p. 1716). The current results suggest that interventions targeted to female gamblers <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> that focus on addressing broader family issues such as drug use and the availability of tangible support, in addition to emotion regulation strategies could potentially reduce the risk of violence perpetration by female gamblers <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R
