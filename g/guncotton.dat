5|$|Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street {{was founded}} in the early 19th century and during the First World War {{manufactured}} <b>guncotton.</b> A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a beam engine to pump water to the reservoirs above.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Elizabeth Lummis {{published}} {{her first}} book, entitled Poems, Translated and Original, which included her tragedy, Teresa Contarini, {{based on the}} history of Venice, that was successfully performed in New York and other cities. Around this time she married William Henry Ellet (1806–1859), a chemist from New York City. He graduated from Columbia College in New York and earned a gold medal for a dissertation on the compounds of cyanogen. The couple moved to Columbia, South Carolina, when he was made professor of chemistry, mineralogy and geology at South Carolina College in 1836. He also discovered a new and inexpensive method of preparing <b>guncotton,</b> for which the state of South Carolina presented him a service of silver plate.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis {{complained to}} the British Archaeological Association that more {{needed to be done}} to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using <b>guncotton.</b> The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion. The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship had}} five {{submerged}} 14-inch-diameter torpedo tubes, and carried 18 Mark II torpedoes. With {{a range of}} just 600 yards, these had a 26-pound <b>guncotton</b> charge and a speed of 18 knots, only marginally faster than Polyphemus.|$|E
25|$|Hopewell, {{part of the}} Eppes' plantation, was {{developed}} by DuPont Company in 1914 as Hopewell Farm, an incorporated area in Prince George County. DuPont first built a dynamite factory there, then switched to the manufacture of <b>guncotton</b> during World War I.|$|E
25|$|When {{dynamite}} {{was invented}} in 1867 and quickly became popular, a new dynamite plant was opened in 1869 near San Francisco in the area which later became Golden Gate Park. The danger of accidental explosions near a population center became unacceptable as San Francisco expanded; and land was purchased on Point Pinole in 1879 to shift manufacturing to {{the east side of}} San Francisco Bay. After initial purchases in 1868, DuPont had obtained 43% interest in California Powder Works by 1876, and financed Hercules Powder Company with Laflin & Rand Powder Company in 1882. The city of Hercules was named after California Powder Works' blasting powder, known as Hercules Powder, which in turn was named for the powerful Greek demigod, Hercules. <b>Guncotton</b> and nitroglycerine manufactured at Hercules were shipped to the smokeless powder plant at Santa Cruz.|$|E
25|$|She was {{chartered}} {{to carry}} a complete cargo of miscellaneous types of military explosives from New York to France in November 1917. Mont-Blanc was not an especially old vessel but was a relatively slow, common, three-island type tramp steamer, typical of many wartime freighters. She left New York December 1 to join a convoy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command of}} Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid, the high-octane fuel benzole, and <b>guncotton.</b> She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E
500|$|The battleships {{were also}} armed with two {{submerged}} [...] torpedo tubes, {{one on each}} broadside. Each tube was angled 10° forward and 3° downward. Each ship carried six Modèle 1909R torpedoes. They had a [...] warhead and two speed/range settings: [...] at [...] or [...] at [...] The Dantons also had storage space for 10 Harlé Modèle 1906 mines, which had an explosive charge of [...] of <b>guncotton.</b> These could not be laid by the ships themselves, but had to be off-loaded for use.|$|E
500|$|The French {{cargo ship}} [...] arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command}} of Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the {{explosives}} TNT and picric acid, the highly flammable fuel benzole, and <b>guncotton.</b> She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E
500|$|The first {{production}} of <b>guncotton</b> {{took place in}} the Marsh Works in 1847. Due to a lack of experience with production methods, an explosion took place soon after work started, with several fatalities. [...] On Sunday 2 April 1916, an explosion occurred at one of the Swale factories in Uplees after sparks from a chimney ignited the works containing around 150 tonnes of high explosives. The incident killed over 100 people, which led to decline of the explosives industry in the town. Later accounts suggested that had the incident not happened on a Sunday, there would have been many more casualties.|$|E
500|$|In 1811 a new {{magazine}} {{building was}} erected {{a little way}} downstream from the castle, relieving pressure on the castle. Upnor Castle ceased {{to be used as}} a storage magazine after 1827 and was converted into an Ordnance Laboratory (i.e. a workshop for filling explosive shells with gunpowder). Further storage space was required, and six hulks [...] were moored alongside to serve as floating magazines; they remained even after a further magazine had been built ashore (1857). These storage problems were only alleviated when a further five large magazines, guarded by a barracks, were built inland at Chattenden (these were linked to Upnor via a 2ft 6in (76cm) narrow-gauge line built for steam locomotives). In 1891, the castle and its associated depot came under the full control of the Admiralty, ending an arrangement in which the War Office had managed the site with the Admiralty providing the funding. In 1899 it was noted that the castle was being used to store dry <b>guncotton</b> (a highly-flammable and dangerous explosive), while the less dangerous 'wet guncotton' form was kept on board the ever-present hulks moored nearby. This practice ceased soon afterwards, specialist storage magazines having been built alongside Chattenden at Lodge Hill.|$|E
2500|$|SS Mont-Blanc was a {{freighter}} {{built in}} Middlesbrough, England in 1899 and {{purchased by the}} French company, Société Générale de Transport Maritime (SGTM). On Thursday morning, 6 December 1917, she entered Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada laden with a full cargo of highly volatile explosives. As {{she made her way}} through the Narrows towards Bedford Basin, she was involved in a collision with the Norwegian ship, [...] A fire aboard the French ship ignited her cargo of wet and dry picric acid, TNT, and <b>guncotton.</b> The resultant Halifax Explosion levelled the Richmond District and killed approximately 2,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|Trade on {{the upper}} part of the {{navigation}} to Stowmarket was extremely limited, with just an occasional barge carrying manure to Prentice's Manure Works, and returning with <b>guncotton,</b> which was manufactured at an explosives works. There was more traffic between Ipswich and Bramford, as barges regularly worked to Fison's and Packard's factories. The companies paid lower tolls because they helped to maintain the lock gates and clear weeds from the channel. 30-ton barges were worked through the lower four locks in trains of two dumb barges with a steam-powered barge pulling them. By 1917, the undertaking was virtually bankrupt. Income amounted to around £220 per year, with expenditure running at £480, and there was no capital left. The Trustees tried to make economies, but in May 1922, with the current account overdrawn, they resolved to close the navigation from 3 June 1922.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} British {{operation}} of its kind, Royal Engineer tunnelling companies laid six mines by 10 April 1915, an operation planned by Major-General Edward Bulfin, {{commander of the}} 28th Division and continued by the 5th Division when the 28th Division was relieved. The 173rd Tunnelling Company began work early in March and three tunnels were begun towards the German line, about [...] away, a pit first having been dug some [...] deep. By the time the work was finished, the tunnels stretched more than [...] Two mines in the north were charged with [...] of explosives each, two mines in the centre had [...] charges and in the south one mine was packed with [...] of <b>guncotton,</b> although work on it had been stopped when it ran close to a German tunnel. The locality was photographed from the air, which revealed German gun emplacements and entrenchments. On 16 April, British artillery was ranged by air observers onto the approaches to Hill 60, ready for the attack. British infantry began to assemble after dark and 1 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was made responsible for keeping German aircraft away from the area.|$|E
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or <b>guncotton</b> (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|E
6000|$|... “Three shells, each {{containing}} {{two hundred}} pounds of <b>guncotton,</b> were fired last night from the dynamite guns of the Vesuvius at the hill at the western entrance to Santiago Harbour, on {{which there is a}} fort.|$|E
60|$|The {{prelude to}} this third {{bombardment}} of Santiago {{was a second}} trial of the Vesuvius at midnight on the fifteenth, when she sent three more 250-pound charges of <b>guncotton</b> into the fortifications. This done, the fleet remained like spectres, each vessel at its respective station, until half-past three o’clock {{on the morning of}} the sixteenth, when the bluejackets were aroused and served with coffee.|$|E
60|$|Three more {{charges of}} <b>guncotton</b> did the {{dynamite}} cruiser Vesuvius throw into the batteries {{at the mouth}} of Santiago Harbour on the night of June 26th, and next morning the evidences of her work could be seen on the western battery, a portion of which was in ruins. The water-mains which supplied the city of Santiago were cut on the same night, and the doomed city thus brought so much nearer to capitulation.|$|E
6000|$|BARBARA. That is why I have no class, Dolly: I come {{straight}} out of the heart of the whole people. If I were middle-class I should turn my back on my father's business; and we should both live in an artistic drawingroom, with you reading the reviews in one corner, and I in the other at the piano, playing Schumann: both very superior persons, and neither of us a bit of use. Sooner than that, I would sweep out the <b>guncotton</b> shed, or be one of Bodger's barmaids. Do you know {{what would have happened if}} you had refused papa's offer? ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{and only}} here the story varies. For {{some reason the}} fuse used for the <b>guncotton</b> was defective, and half an hour elapsed before the {{explosion}} destroyed the howitzer. When it came it came very thoroughly, {{but it was a}} weary time in coming. Then our men descended the hill, but the Boers were already crowding in upon them from either side. The English cries of the soldiers were answered in English by the Boers, and slouch hat or helmet dimly seen in the mirk was the only badge of friend or foe. A singular letter is extant from young Reitz (the son of the Transvaal secretary), who was present. According to his account there were but eight Boers present, but assertion or contradiction equally valueless in the darkness of such a night, and there are some obvious discrepancies in his statement. 'We fired among them,' says Reitz. 'They stopped and all cried out [...] "Rifle Brigade." [...] Then one of them said [...] "Charge!" [...] One officer, Captain Paley, advanced, though he had two bullet wounds already. Joubert gave him another shot and he fell on the top of us. Four Englishmen got hold of Jan Luttig and struck him on the head with their rifles and stabbed him in the stomach with a bayonet. He seized two of them by the throat and shouted [...] "Help, boys!" [...] His two nearest comrades shot two of them, and the other two bolted. Then the English came up in numbers, about eight hundred, along the footpath' (there were two hundred on the hill, but the exaggeration is pardonable in the darkness), 'and we lay as quiet as mice along the bank. Farther on the English killed three of our men with bayonets and wounded two. In the morning we found Captain Paley and twenty-two of them killed and wounded.' It seems evident that Reitz means that his own little party were eight men, and not that that represented the force which intercepted the retiring riflemen. Within his own knowledge five of his countrymen were killed in the scuffle, so the total loss was probably considerable. Our own casualties were eleven dead, forty-three wounded, and six prisoners, but the price was not excessive for the howitzer and for the morale which arises from such exploits. Had it not been for that unfortunate fuse, the second success might have been as bloodless as the first. 'I am sorry,' said a sympathetic correspondent to the stricken Paley. 'But we got the gun,' Paley whispered, and he spoke for the Brigade.|$|E
50|$|Attempts to {{manufacture}} <b>guncotton</b> for military use failed {{at first because}} the factories were prone to explode and, above all else, the burning speed of straight <b>guncotton</b> was always too high. It was not until 1884 that Paul Vieille tamed <b>guncotton</b> into a successful progressive smokeless gunpowder called Poudre B. Later on, in 1891, James Dewar and Frederick Augustus Abel also managed to transform gelatinized <b>guncotton</b> into a safe mixture, called cordite because it could be extruded into long thin cords before being dried.|$|E
50|$|Small arms {{could not}} {{withstand}} the pressures generated by <b>guncotton.</b> After {{one of the}} Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice & Company began manufacturing <b>guncotton</b> in Stowmarket in 1863; and British War Office chemist Sir Frederick Abel began thorough research at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865, when the second Austrian <b>guncotton</b> factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of <b>guncotton</b> for torpedo and mine warheads.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Guncotton</b> {{is made by}} {{treating}} cotton (used {{as the source of}} cellulose) with concentrated sulfuric acid and 70% nitric acid cooled to 0 °C to produce cellulose trinitrate. While <b>guncotton</b> is dangerous to store, the hazards it presents can be reduced by storing it dampened with various liquids, such as alcohol. For this reason, accounts of <b>guncotton</b> usage dating from the early 20th century refer to [...] "wet guncotton".|$|E
50|$|English {{interest}} languished {{after an}} explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two <b>guncotton</b> plants producing artillery propellent, but it too was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would {{reach the end}} of their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful <b>guncotton.</b> Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by <b>guncotton.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{major step}} forward was the {{discovery}} of <b>guncotton,</b> a nitrocellulose-based material, by German chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosive and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. <b>Guncotton</b> was more powerful than gunpowder, {{but at the same}} time was once again somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall & Sons began manufacture in Faversham.|$|E
50|$|Gunpowder {{was used}} as the only form of {{explosive}} up {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Guns using black powder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke and concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. <b>Guncotton,</b> a nitrocellulose-based material, was discovered by Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosive and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. <b>Guncotton</b> was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} [...] "Poudre B" [...] {{tended to}} eventually become unstable, {{which has been}} attributed to evaporation of the volatile solvents, but may also have been due to the difficulty in fully removing the acids used to make <b>guncotton.</b> In the early years of their use both the original Poudre B and <b>guncotton</b> led to accidents. For example, two French battleships, the Iéna and the Liberté, blew up in Toulon harbour in 1907 and 1911 respectively with heavy loss of life. By the end of the 1890s, safer smokeless powders had been developed, including improved and stabilized versions of [...] "Poudre B" [...] (e.g. Poudres BN3F and BPF1), ballistite and cordite. The <b>guncotton</b> problem is not completely solved even today, as an occasional batch of smokeless powder will still deteriorate, although this is extremely rare.|$|E
