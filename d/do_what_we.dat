Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> like with them and not break any laws." ...|$|E

He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can to restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko {{argued that it was}} the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E

500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we <b>do</b> (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)."

It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including [...] "dancing with molly", using a slang term for ecstasy, and [...] "trying to get a line [...] in the bathroom". After initial confusion whether the former lyric was [...] "dancing with molly" [...] or [...] "dancing with Miley", Cyrus clarified that {{she was referring to}} ecstasy, commenting that [...] "if you’re aged ten it’s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know.

Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting.

The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know that we felt like we had no other choice but <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July.

During her stint on the commission, it for the first time condemned anti-Semitism as a human rights violation, and also for the first time prevented China from blocking a motion criticizing its human rights record. Regarding a previous China motion that had failed, Ferraro had told the commission, [...] "Let us <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were sent here to do—decide important questions of human rights on their merits, not avoid them."

500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would go in {{with a lot of}} keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> used to do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

500|$|Some of British punk rock's leading figures {{made a show}} of rejecting {{not only}} {{contemporary}} mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: [...] "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song [...] "1977". The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, [...] "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want to do." ...|$|E

In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record. It was {{inspired}} by punk rock history, as many songs—for example, the Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen"—contain a [...] "no future" [...] lyric. [...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs {{and we all know}} what it's like to have that day off to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E

The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want to do." ...|$|E
