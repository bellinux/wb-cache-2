40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is presented by which the cutting forces in gear <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> process are predicted using the mechanistic approach. To use this approach, {{a detailed description of}} the chip geometry is needed. Eccentricity and run-out tool errors are considered, which is of great importance as the chip thickness will by these errors vary for the subsequent cuts. The chip geometry is determined by comparing the path of the cutting edge with already removed material. The boundary of the chips is determinable from the cutting edge geometry, which is here derived in parametric form so spur and helical gears are manufactured correctly. Locally on the cutting edge, the cutting forces are resolved from orthogonal cutting data and on the basis that these forces are proportional to the instantaneous chip thickness. The load each individual cutting tooth experience in operation, as well as the complete load on the tool, are resolved by summing the forces along the cutting edge. In the model, all cut chips are determined for each machined gear tooth gap, with the gear blank boundaries considered.

40|$|AbstractProduction {{processes}} for large module gears {{are characterized by}} small batch sizes and high workpiece costs. Therefore, the production of scrap parts cannot be accepted. Manufacturing processes are often not pushed to their limits so that the limits themselves are often not clearly known. To use the potentials of modern tool and machine tool concepts, a deeper theoretical understanding of the processes is necessary. This applies especially to modern indexable insert gear cutting tools, which gain importance in these processes. In the past, gear cutting {{processes for}} large module gears have seldom been a subject of scientific research. Therefore, the design of these processes is largely based on experience. Especially, for the newer and more complex tool concepts using indexable inserts, a possibility to analyze processes theoretically is a key factor for {{deeper understanding of the}} processes and tool concepts. In this paper the two most important processes for green machining of large module gears, gear hobbing and <b>form</b> <b>milling,</b> are analyzed using simulation and machining trials. For the process simulation, major changes to existing process simulation tools for gear machining processes were implemented. For suitable machining trials, model processes were developed for milling and hobbing. These allow an analysis of the wear behavior of the tools based on a reduced number of machined parts. In this paper the bridge between simulation and machining for large module gears will be drawn in terms of chip removal and deformation, wear behavior and tool design features. As final result a first method for a simulation based process design will be given...|$|E
30|$|The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) diamond film {{is attractive}} as an ideal coating for excellent characteristics, such as the high hardness, favorable wear resistance, low friction coefficient, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent chemical stability [4, 5]. It is demonstrated that during the machining processes of the Al alloy workpieces, especially under the circumstance of the rough machining, the deposition of diamond films on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) milling cutters can prolong the working lifetime significantly, and improve the machining quality to some extent, because the excellent tribological properties of the diamond film can reduce the adhesion between the cutter and workpiece [6]. However, for the finish machining, since the cutting depth is relatively small, it is supposed that the optimal-designed uncoated WC-Co milling cutters can meet the requirement of the machining quality during their life cycles, but one drawback is that they wear out rapidly, followed by {{the deterioration of the}} machining quality. The employment of the turning or milling cutters made of the monocrystalline diamond is believed as the best choice for finish machining Al alloy workpieces, regardless of the cost, which can be directly used for mirror finishing [7, 8]. It is another option to adopt the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as the cutting edges [9, 10], the wear resistance of which is undoubtedly much higher than that of WC-Co, while lower than those of the monocrystalline diamond and CVD diamond film. This is because the PCD is composed of not only diamond crystals but also some metallic bonding phases. Moreover, for either the monocrystalline diamond or PCD, it is rather difficult to <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> cutters with complicated shapes. Consequently, prolonging the tool life and guaranteeing the long-time machining quality with low cost are main aims of depositing diamond films on milling cutters.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> cutter that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer aided drill point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer aided drill point geometry analysis...|$|E

40|$|Uranium {{mining and}} nuclear power is a {{controversial}} topic as of late, {{especially in light of}} the recent Fukushima event. Although the actual use of nuclear fuel has minimal environmental impact, its issues come at the very beginning and end of the fuel’s life cycle in both the mining and fuel disposal process. This paper focuses on a life cycle analysis (LCA) of uranium mine in the desert nation of Namibia in Southern Africa. The goal of this LCA is to evaluate the environmental effects of uranium mining. The LCA focuses on water and energy embodiment such that they can then be compared to other mines. The functional unit of the analysis is 1 kg of yellowcake (uranium oxide). The processes considered include mining and milling at Langer Heinrich Uranium (LHU). The impact categories evaluated include the categories in ReCiPe assessment method with a focus of water depletion, and cumulative energy demand. It was found that the major environmental impacts are marine ecotoxicity, human toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity. These mainly came from electricity consumption in the mining and milling process, especially electricity generated from hard coal. Milling tailings was also a contributor, especially for marine ecotoxicity and human toxicity. The other electricity generation types, including nuclear, hydro, natural gas, and diesel contribute to marine exotoxicity and human toxicity as well. Hydro-electricity, tailings <b>form</b> <b>milling,</b> sodium carbonate, and nuclear electricity also cause freshwater eutrophication at the LHU mine. The major contributor of the water depletion was hard coal generated electricity consumption as well. Tailings also led to a level of water depletion that was significant but much smaller than that of the coal-based electricity. In terms of energy, weighting portrayed the main energy used to be nuclear power, in terms of MJ equivalents. Nuclear power was then followed by fossil fuels and finally hydropower. Most of the energy used was for the uranium mining process rather than the milling process. As expected, the direct water, and energy values, 0. 5459 m 3 and 97. 34 kWh per kg of yellowcake, were much lower than the LCA embodiment values of 282. 67 m 3 and 76, 479 kWh per kg of yellowcake. When compared to other mines, the water use at LHU was found to be much lower while the energy use was found to be much higher...|$|E
