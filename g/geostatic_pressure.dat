40|$|Chalk is {{affected}} by different diagenetic processes in comparison with other carbonate rocks. Commonly observed lithification processes are pressure-solution and reprecipitation and neomorphism. The first process is divisible into: (a) spot-welding or welding; (b) overgrowth; (c) stylolitization and cementation. Further, pressure-solution and reprecipitation is dependent on (a) <b>geostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> and (b) the ratio of Mg/Ca in the pore fluid. Overgrowth of calcite cement {{is controlled by the}} size and shape of the biogenic crystals. Neomorphism is also important in diagenesis. Neomorphic process dominates when pressure-solution process is ineffective. Organic and insoluble residue content dictate neomorphism. In conclusion, pressure-solution or neomorphism or a combination of both accounts for various modes of lithification observed in chalk...|$|E
40|$|In 1997 - 1998, an {{abandonment}} {{test was}} performed in a 950 -m deep, 8000 -m 3 salt cavern operated by GDF SUEZ at Etrez, France. In this relatively small brine-filled cavern, which had been kept idle for 15 years before the test, thermal equilibrium was reached. A special system was designed to monitor leaks, which proved to be exceedingly small. In these conditions, brine permeation and cavern creep closure are the only factors to play significant roles in pressure evolution. This test strongly suggested that obtaining an equilibrium pressure such {{that the effects of}} these two factors were exactly equal would be reached in the long term. Four years later, pressure monitoring in the closed cavern resumed. Pressure evolution during the 2002 - 2009 period confirmed that cavern brine pressure will remain constant and significantly smaller than <b>geostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> in the long term, precluding any risk of fracturing and brine seepage to the overburden layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{foundation}} soils of {{the majority}} of complicated buildings (or high-rise structures) in the Bratislava urban area are formed by the Neogene sediments, situated below the Quaternary cover. These are prevailingly high-rise buildings founded in the deep foundation pits. This contribution is focused on the analysis of the possible relations between the sediments origin and their geotechnical parameters (properties). The introductory part of the analysis was carried out on the model profile situated at the left bank of the Danube River, where the construction of high-rise buildings containing underground part was concentrated recently. The analysis was oriented on the characteristic of the pre-Quaternary basement surface morphology, geologic structure up to the reach of the exploration works and substantial geotechnical characteristics of the foundation soils. The analysis comprised comparison of geotechnical properties of the Neogene cohesive subsoils of the pre-Quaternary basement on the localities with predicted occurrence of genetically different lithostratigraphic formations. The sedimentological and geotechnical characteristics of foundation soils of the Neogene complex formed the baseline data of the analysis. The geotechnical data were taken from the engineering geological tasks realized by the authors of this study. The results of the analysis point out on the mutual affinity of the foundation soil properties, belonging to the Beladice Fm. (deltaic sequence) and Volkovce Fm. (alluvial sequence). The <b>geostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> (pressure of the superposed layers) existing during the entire period of their burial in the profile have had the dominant influence on the actual geotechnical parameters (geological pre-consolidation). This effect overwhelms the differences in the subsoils properties, which could be determined by the facies character related to their origin. Studied sedimentary formations differ in lateral stability: the Volkovce Fm. exhibits much higher lateral lithological heterogeneity than Beladice Fm., what could affect a construction site conditions. Due to the relatively massive input data files, the results of the analysis can serve beside a clearer orientation in the local Neogene lithostratigraphy also for the primary orientation in local geotechnical parameters values of the subsoils. An analogous study will be elaborated in the further continuation on an area of the wider city centre...|$|E
30|$|For the 3 D model, the {{boundaries}} {{were defined as}} 60 m in width from {{each side of the}} centerline of the structure and 60 m in depth from the underneath of foundation (see FigureÂ  3). As in the 2 D idealization, standard fixtures were applied as boundaries to the outer surfaces of the continuum media, and {{the boundaries}} were specified after several analyses to minimize the effects of the boundaries on the results and <b>geostatic</b> <b>pressures.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of sedimentary basins aims at reconstructing its historical evolution {{in order to}} provide quantitative predictions about phenomena leading to hydrocarbon accumulations. The kernel of this simulation is the numerical solution of a complex system of time dependent, three-dimensional partial dierential equations (PDE) of mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type. A discretisation (Finite Volumes + Implicit Euler) and linearisation (Newton) of this system leads to very ill-conditioned, strongly non-symmetric and large systems of linear equations with three unknowns per mesh element, i. e. <b>pressure,</b> <b>geostatic</b> load, and hydrocarbon saturation...|$|R
30|$|Overburden {{pressure}} (total vertical stress, total external <b>pressure,</b> lithostatic <b>pressure,</b> <b>geostatic</b> load) originates {{from the}} combined weight of formation matrix and the fluid in the pore spaces overlying {{the formation of}} interest. Skeleton pressure (matrix stress, grain-to-grain pressure, vertical effective stress, frame pressure) of a rock is the total external pressure less the fluid pressure. The elastic parameters of the skeleton increase as the skeleton pressure increases, and a corresponding increase in velocity is observed. The increase in elastic parameters is attributable to the reactions at the intergranular contacts and {{the closure of the}} microcracks as the skeleton pressure increases. Hence, when both overburden pressure and formation fluid pressure are varied, only {{the difference between the two}} has a significant influence on velocity. When the skeleton pressure is increased, the velocity increases; when the difference remains constant, the velocity remains constant (Gardner et al. 1974).|$|R
