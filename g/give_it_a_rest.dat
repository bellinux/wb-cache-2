6000|$|The {{instant the}} {{creature}} was discovered, the insatiable Anglo-Saxon delight in killing birds, from the majestic eagle to the contemptible sparrow, displayed itself in its full frenzy. The crew ran about the decks, the passengers rushed into their cabins, eager to seize the first gun {{and to have the}} first shot. An old quarter-master of the Aquila was the enviable man, who first found the means of destruction ready to his hand. He lifted the gun to his shoulder, he had his finger on the trigger, when he was suddenly pounced upon by one of the passengers--a young, slim, sunburnt, active man--who snatched away the gun, discharged it {{over the side of the}} vessel, and turned furiously on the quarter-master. [...] "You wretch! would you kill the poor weary bird that trusts our hospitality, and only asks us to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>rest?</b> That little harmless thing is as much one of God's creatures as you are.

40|$|For {{about two}} decades, say Johnson and Pace, the {{discussion}} of how to address prose style in teaching college writing has been stuck, with style standing in {{as a proxy for}} other stakes in the theory wars. The traditional argument is evidently still quite persuasive to some—that teaching style is mostly a matter of teaching generic conventions through repetition and practice. Such a position usually presumes the traditional view of composition as essentially a service course, one without content of its own. On the other side, the shortcomings of this argument have been much discussed—that it neglects invention, revision, context, meaning, even truth; that it is not congruent with research; that it ignores 100 years of scholarship establishing composition 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual territory beyond 2 ̆ 2 service. 2 ̆ 2 The discussion is stuck there, and all sides have been <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>rest</b> in recent scholarship. Yet style remains of vital practical interest to the field, because everyone has to teach it one way or another. A consequence of the impasse is that a theory of style itself has not been well articulated. Johnson and Pace suggest that moving the field toward a better consensus will require establishing style as a clearer subject of inquiry. Accordingly, this collection takes up a comprehensive study of the subject. Part I explores the recent history of composition studies, the ways it has figured and all but effaced the whole question of prose style. Part II takes to heart Elbow 2 ̆ 7 s suggestion that composition and literature, particularly as conceptualized in the context of creative writing courses, have something to learn from each other. Part III sketches practical classroom procedures for heightening students 2 ̆ 7 abilities to engage style, and part IV explores new theoretical frameworks for defining this vital and much neglected territory. The hope of the essays here—focusing as they do on historical, aesthetic, practical, and theoretical issues—is to awaken composition studies to the possibilities of style, and, in turn, to rejuvenate a great many classrooms.

50|$|In April, STAVKAs {{attention}} {{turned to}} completing {{the war with}} Finland. In May, the 314th {{was assigned to the}} 23rd Army in the eastern sector of the Soviet-Finnish front in the Isthmus of Karelia, <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> chance to <b>rest</b> and recuperate after the previous campaign. It was now assigned to the 115th Rifle Corps, where it would remain until just {{before the start of the}} new campaign, when it was re-assigned to the 108th Rifle Corps, in the Leningrad Front reserves. The offensive opened on June 10 with a massive artillery preparation and overwhelming strength in men and equipment, and by the 14th the Finns were back in their second line. At this point the 108th Corps was transferred to 21st Army. The Corps launched an attack on the Finnish 1st Cavalry Brigades defenses at Vankhasakha and Metsiakiulia that day, but was unsuccessful. After getting armor support and an artillery preparation, a new attack the next day succeeded. By this time, the 314th had reached the neck of land between Vammel-iarvi and Riesk-iarvi. On June 20, the division, along with its running-mate from the same Corps, 90th Rifle Division, and the 372nd Rifle Division of 97th Rifle Corps, occupied Vyborg, which the Finns had evacuated. The 314th saw some limited additional fighting in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, after which it was reassigned once again to 59th Army, where it would remain until the end of the war.|$|R

40|$|Possession, Belonging, Self-denial and Detachment of the Soul The {{state of}} “I” and “ME” are the {{attachment}} {{to the world and}} its objects. Self denial and denial of the self from everything is the detachment of the soul from the earthly life. When we don’t relate ourselves to the life-cycle of birth and death; realizing everything belongs to the universe and not to consider oneself the owner of any earthly objects or relations makes one detached from the self. When we relate ourselves to some form and/or entity, then we have the attributes of the character in ourselves. When we deny the entity as ourselves and deny the “I”, then we are not related to any relation or belongings of that particular subject. When we deny the self, along we deny any belongings and possessions of the particular self, making ourselves out of the daily worldly life. Hence we realize true nature of the self, the Soul. State of Being Conscious, Sub-Conscious and Un-Conscious When we are aware of the self and in the present, it is in the conscious state. When we are in some state of mind and not in the present, it is sub-consciousness. While in this state, Mind will take you (self-the worldly persona) to the arena you want to be and sometimes to some unknown strange states (may be place, people or situation) that pertaining to the self. When the body is at rest, still mind takes the self to the other realms that the self is related to some or other way. This is not sub-conscious state of Mind, but Sub-conscious state of Self. And when we are not with the body, it is a state of unconsciousness. Since Mind and body is not real, part of the Illusionist world we need to leave it for sometime on a daily basis. So we <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>rest</b> that called sleeping, when we are not present in the body! Truth is relative when Self is Absolute. But Self is not Absolute, so Truth is Absolute and Real. Perceptions are Relative and Unreal. Truth-Real or Relative: World is a state of Mind: a Perception not Real...|$|E
