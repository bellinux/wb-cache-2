5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system, attaching through an expansion slot {{on the side of the}} main console. Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, karaoke CD+G discs, and can also be {{used in conjunction with}} the 32X to play 32-bit games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis, as well as an extension spacer to work with the original model of the Genesis.|$|E

25|$|Maupertuis' {{principle}} {{requires that}} the two endpoint states q1 and q2 be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory (same energy for each trajectory). This forces the endpoint times to be varied as well.

25|$|IMF {{conditionality}} {{is a set}} {{of policies}} or conditions that the IMF requires in exchange for financial resources. The IMF <b>does</b> <b>require</b> collateral from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. If the conditions are not met, the funds are withheld. The concept of conditionality was introduced in a 1952 Executive Board decision and later incorporated into the Articles of Agreement.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to the}} Guam and CNMI {{visa waiver}} program for certain countries, an {{eligibility}} pre-clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, <b>does</b> <b>require</b> a passport.|$|E

Nevada corporations offer great flexibility to the Board of Directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are cumbersome to business managers in some other states. In addition, Nevada has no franchise tax, although it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> businesses to have a license for which the business has to pay the state.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the fastest}} growing {{ceramics}} industry sector is composed of small companies that manufacture mostly handmade tableware and decorative articles. This industry sector is rapidly finding export markets in the United States, the Far East, and {{in some parts of}} Europe. It is labor-intensive, but <b>does</b> <b>require</b> the importation of certain equipment such as kilns. Most of goods produced by this sector is exported to the United States. As this sector continues to grow and become more sophisticated, more manufacturing equipment will likely be imported.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{to reduce}} fever is {{generally}} not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Measures such as putting a cool damp cloth on the forehead and having a slightly warm bath are not useful and may simply make a person more uncomfortable. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia <b>does</b> <b>require</b> treatment.|$|E

25|$|This is the {{standard}} process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo-opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process {{makes it easy to}} produce high quality maps, but it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> a number of specialist tools.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but <b>does</b> <b>require</b> the NASA Deep Space Network for communications.|$|E

25|$|Immunization {{against the}} {{pathogens}} that cause diarrheal {{disease is a}} viable prevention strategy, however it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera {{is not one of}} the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease. Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} {{insemination}} quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous {{to keep on}} the average dairy facility. AI also {{makes it possible to}} speed the genetic improvement of the dairy herd because every dairy farmer has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI <b>does</b> <b>require</b> more intensive reproductive management of the herd as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly inseminate a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, hotness means that, {{when comparing}} any two given bodies {{in their respective}} separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it <b>does</b> <b>require</b> that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
