5000|$|A <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> Declaration (DID) is a {{document}} that specifies the makeup, structure and organisation of a <b>Digital</b> <b>Item.</b> The purpose of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> Declaration is to describe a set of abstract terms and concepts, to form a useful model for defining what a <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> is. Following this model, a <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> is the digital representation of an object, which is managed, described or exchanged within the model.|$|E
50|$|Towards this {{objective}} {{the adaptation of}} Digital Items is required.

40|$|Due to {{the vast}} size, {{real-time}} requirement, QoS consideration, etc., of mobile devices, techniques like multimedia transcoding are developed to satisfy the need of surfing the multimedia services using mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a P 2 P resource sharing architecture for adapting MPEG- 21 <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> in mobile networks. In the proposed P 2 P architecture, <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> can be shared among heterogeneous networking environments. Meanwhile, <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> can be dynamically adapted according to the networking situation and user’s device capacity. The proposed P 2 P system introduced a new cache and replacement algorithm for managing adapted <b>digital</b> <b>items,</b> which can smooth the transcoding delay variations of <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> during subsequent resource sharing among different networked devices. 1...|$|R

At its most basic level, MPEG-21 provides a framework in which one user interacts with another one, and the object of that interaction is a <b>Digital</b> <b>Item.</b> Due to that, we could say that the main objective of the MPEG-21 is to define the technology needed to support users to exchange, access, consume, trade or manipulate Digital Items in an efficient and transparent way.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{above-mentioned}} MPEG standard extensions {{are used by}} other formats based on ISO base media file format (e.g. 3GP). [...] The 3GPP file format (.3gp) specification also defined extensions to support H.263 video, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+ audio and 3GPP Timed Text in files based on the ISO base media file format. The 3GPP2 file format (.3g2) defined extensions for usage of EVRC, SMV or 13K (QCELP) voice compression formats. The JPEG 2000 specification (ISO/IEC 15444-3) defined usage of Motion JPEG 2000 video compression and uncompressed audio (PCM) in ISO base media file format (.mj2). The [...] "DVB File Format" [...] (.dvb) defined by DVB Project allowed storage of DVB services in the ISO base media file format. It allows the storage of audio, video and other content in any of three main ways: encapsulated in a MPEG transport stream, stored as a reception hint track; encapsulated in an RTP stream, stored as a reception hint track or stored directly as media tracks. The MPEG-21 File Format (.m21, [...]mp21) defined the storage of an MPEG-21 <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> in ISO base media file format, with {{some or all of}} its ancillary data (such as movies, images or other non-XML data) within the same file. The OMA DRM Content Format (.dcf) specification from Open Mobile Alliance defined the content format for DRM protected encrypted media objects and associated metadata. There are also other extensions, such as ISMA ISMACryp specification for encrypted/protected audio and video, G.719 audio compression specification, AC3 and E-AC-3 audio compression, DTS audio compression, Dirac video compression, VC-1 video compression specification and others, which are named on the MP4 Registration authority's website.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} the gaming industry develops a highly competitive environment, which provides an incubator of innovation. These conditions lead {{to the emergence of}} new business models. Free to play as one of those newly and still developing models is currently trending among the game developing and publishing companies. Delivering skyrocketing profits, the full potential of the model is yet to be revealed. At first sight, the model has a simplistic structure on the business side, however, on the user side it is unclear what motivates players to become customers through the purchase of <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> in the games. This research uses an exploratory and qualitative approach to collect data and identify purchasing behaviour stimuli. It also proposes an option of connecting personality theories as a possible explanation to the purchasing behaviour of players. As a focus for this study, the currently most successful free to play game, League of Legends, was selected and twelve interviews with League of Legends players were conducted. The interviews consisted of two parts, one semi-structured and the other one structured. The semi-structured interview aimed at identifying purchasing behaviour and finding reasons for the purchase of <b>digital</b> <b>items</b> in League of Legends. The second was a personality assessment test, Keirsey Temperament Sorter 2. A conventional content analysis of the interviews identified the theme “personal satisfaction” as the main motivation for purchasing <b>digital</b> <b>items.</b> The investigation regarding the proposed connection to personality theory, the research’s results fail to show any connection. However, answering research question number one unveils the importance of the personality factor remains valid and a subject of future research. The research discusses possibilities and direction for future research in the face of testing other than the applied Keirsey personality theory. ...|$|R
