[...] In May 1998, India for the second time (since its first test in 1974) tested nuclear weapons (see Pokhran-II), followed by Pakistan (see Chagai-I) with its first-ever nuclear test.

5000|$|On 9 January 2014, a Chinese {{hypersonic}} glide vehicle (HGV) {{referred to}} as the WU-14 was allegedly spotted flying at high speeds over the country. The flight was confirmed by the Pentagon as a hypersonic <b>missile</b> <b>delivery</b> vehicle capable of penetrating the U.S. missile defense system and delivering nuclear warheads. The WU-14 is reportedly designed to be launched as the final stage of a Chinese ICBM traveling at Mach 10, or 12,360 km/h. Two Chinese technical papers from December 2012 and April 2013 show the country has concluded hypersonic weapons pose [...] "a new aerospace threat" [...] and that they are developing satellite directed precision guidance systems.

5000|$|The yield-to-weight {{ratio is}} the amount of weapon yield {{compared}} to the mass of the weapon. According to nuclear-weapons designer Ted Taylor, the practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons is about 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton (25 TJ/kg). The [...] "Taylor limit" [...] is not derived from first principles, and weapons with yields as high as 9.5 megatons per metric ton have been designed and built.

By equating {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction and missiles as key concerns, the two leaders acknowledged one of the most significant developments in international military security over the last five years or so, and seemed newly interested in using arms control as a means of addressing it. Efforts to find new ways to tackle the problem have been driven by a threefold crisis in strategies for coping with ballistic missile proliferation. First, the proliferation of such missiles was perceived to increase. Second, the existing international regime to promote the non-proliferation of ballid urgency to the search for durable diplomatic solutions. Over the course of the last year, these three factors combined to compel the MTCR to formulate a Draft Code of Conduct on Ballistic Missile Proliferation, a CBM-based initiative designed to establish the basis for a non-proliferation regime on missile activities...|$|R
