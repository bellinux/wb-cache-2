40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999 has led to many <b>initiatives</b> and <b>inquiries</b> in other regions regarding the merits and prospects of currency unions. One of the regions where a currency union has been of interest is the Pacific Island countries along with Australia and New Zealand. This paper investigates the degree of economic convergence among these countries and maps out the movement of regional currencies with the core currency, the Australian dollar. Overall, we found the economies in this region show a trend toward divergence. While most currencies closely moved with the Australian dollar, the evidence suggests such a currency union may be premature at this time...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} collates {{examples of}} the author’s practice, <b>initiatives,</b> <b>inquiries,</b> and scholarship in the five year period from 2010 to 2015. In conjunction with the critical commentary, ‘Developing a Curriculum for Engagement for Architectural Education at Northumbria University’ it serves {{to satisfy the requirements}} of Northumbria University’s regulations for the submission of a Professional Doctorate by Portfolio. The individual components within this portfolio seek to underpin the author’s claim towards developing a ‘curriculum for engagement’ in support of the student’s holistic educational experience of architectural education at Northumbria. The majority of the components have resulted from collaborations with colleagues {{in the course of the}} author’s practice. These have included fellow academics, academic managers, colleagues from other institutions and disciplines, as well as students of the programmes of architecture. In support of developing a ‘curriculum for engagement’, these collaborative works embody the notion of ‘communicative action’ (Habermas, 1981) in seeking consensual, iterative and beneficial initiatives for the benefit of student learning and experience. All inquiries have been supported by ethical permissions from relevant schools and faculties in the institution. All components have also been made available in the public domain, through a variety of outlets relevant to the particular output and audience. Permissions have been sought and granted for their reproduction in this portfolio. The individual components have been re-formatted for the purpose of this portfolio in order to comply with Northumbria University regulations for doctoral submissions. Font sizes and type, line-spaces and layouts have been standardised, and Harvard Northumbria has been used throughout for the purposes of citations and in-text referencing.

50|$|The {{commemoration}} {{has evolved}} from a human rights <b>initiative</b> and <b>inquiry</b> into several cases of extra judicial killings during the regime, into an open call for violence directed against whatever government {{happens to be in}} power. Violence often involves throwing rocks against buildings, vehicles, and police, as well as fire-bombing with Molotov cocktails. Given the general unrest-prone day, violence is directed not only against public and government buildings, but also against private property and commercial enterprises such as electrical wiring and power stations. These actions also serve as a cover-up for lootings and other deliberate criminal actions done by organized groups. Most of the violent protests are in the Villa Francia neighborhood, in Estación Central Commune of western Santiago, the place where the Vergara Toledo family resides. Whereas some commemorations in Chile involve peaceful marches, the Día del Joven Combatiente is well known to warrant violent action from hooded insurgents, this has caused local media to refer to the event as the Día del Joven Delincuente (Day of the Young Delinquent).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{strategy}} for exploring the life-centric practice of a lecturer in Higher Education. The <b>initiative</b> for this <b>inquiry</b> arose out of the realisation that there {{did not appear to}} be positive, heart-lifting stories in a lecturer’s current teaching experiences. Using an appreciative eye and supported by a critical friend, life-giving experiences were ‘stalked’ from the past. The hope in this endeavour was to find greater meaning in the lecturer’s best professional practice. Using an Appreciative Inquiry approach, this endeavour rejuvenated the lecturer’s professional practice. As life-centric stories were recalled, provocative propositions were constructed that became the basis of a personalised action plan for future professional practice. This paper outlines the nature of the journey and the heartfelt discoveries...|$|R

40|$|Including {{narratives}} of practice across diverse Australian settings, Engaging with Educational Change fills {{a gap in}} the current educational change literature. Building on the experience of the authors and their colleagues, this book illustrates the power of practitioner inquiry to facilitate positive, practice-improving change and suggests how others might use this methodology to extend current thinking and evaluation. The book includes the voices of practitioners and academics working with a diverse range of age groups and settings across public and private educational contexts, including primary schools, preschools and childcare centres. This multi-perspective real research helps inform and inspire people from a range of backgrounds and expertise who want to facilitate practitioner <b>inquiry</b> <b>initiatives</b> themselves. The book begins by introducing practitioner inquiry, exploring the principles of inquiry-based practice and issues of data alongside the landscapes of educational change. Chapters in part two then offer real-life case studies highlighting experiences of using practitioner inquiry or supporting those working with these methods to improve educational practice and ultimately the outcomes for children. The chapters include case studies of pedagogical leadership and the exploration of issues related to sustaining educational change. The final section concludes the book by critically reflecting upon practitioner inquiry and providing guidance for those interested in this change methodology. Investigating issues that arise during implementation of practitioner <b>inquiry</b> <b>initiatives,</b> Engaging with Educational Change provides both critique and assistance for students and practitioners applying the process in their own settings.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written on the {{importance}} of increasing leadership capacity in schools and managing systems for leadership development. However, little focus has been given to creating the necessary conditions to facilitate the emergence of leadership in order to support school improvement. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a philosophy and method for promoting transformational change within organisations, shifting from a traditional problem-based orientation to a more strength-based approach to change, which focuses on affirmation, appreciation and positive dialogue. This research study examines an innovative appreciative approach to facilitating positive and rapid school improvement. This is achieved through qualitative analysis whereby I explore the emergence of middle leadership during an Appreciative <b>Inquiry</b> <b>initiative</b> in a large, urban Academy and identify those features of Appreciative Inquiry that were conducive to such emergence. In addition, I show that the initiative provided participants with many of the elements considered vital to leading a vibrant and democratic learning community. These are opportunities for professional reflection and sense-making, a safe and affirming learning community, time to dialogue with others within the organisation regarding their core values and commitments, a collaborative work culture, space for networking, and the freedom to take action...|$|R
40|$|What do {{scholars}} {{know about}} the internet, social media, and other ICTs in African elections? Information on the role electronic media plays in politics on the African continent is limited, with little scholarly work empirically examining the role of electronic media in African elections. In this report, we focus specifically on crowd-sourced publics in the Kenyan context. We intend to contribute to literature on ICT 4 D and governance, particularly highlighting the potential and limitations of non-profit ICT-using intermediaries and their work to re-define the relationship between citizens and the State. Throughout this report, we center on questions {{about the role of}} the crowdsourcing <b>initiative</b> Uchaguzi. This <b>inquiry</b> examines technical challenges, the organization’s ability to catalyze responses to reports of violence, the organization’s connection with the media establishment and the wider public as well as Uchaguzi’s overall role in strengthening electoral transparency and accountability. To address these questions, we employed mixed methods involving both qualitative and quantitative analyses as well as field methods and desk research. Data collection focused on review of documentary sources in addition to collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Empirical and qualitative sources included fourteen semi-structured qualitative interviews with founders, designers, and implementers. We also conducted a short survey to assess citizens’ familiarity with Uchaguzi, reaching a total of 446 people and covering most regions in Kenya...|$|R
40|$|This paper centres on the {{tensions}} between the introduction of plagiarism detection software (Turnitin) for student and tutor use at undergraduate level and the aim to promote a developmental approach to writing for assessment at a UK university. Aims to promote developmental models for writing often aim to counteract {{the effects of the}} structural organisation of learning and assessment in higher education. This paper will discuss the potential for the implementation of plagiarism detection software to operate as a 'change artefact', creating opportunities for a departure from the habits of practice created by the demands of writing for assessment and the potential for the emergence of enclaves of good practice in respect of writing development. Tutor and student qualitative responses, gathered via questionnaires and focus groups were analysed in order to investigate the effectiveness of this <b>initiative.</b> In this <b>inquiry</b> plagiarism detection emerges as a dominant theme within regulatory discourses of malpractice in higher education. The promotion of writing development via a tool for regulation and plagiarism detection seems to be a mismatch {{and the extent to which}} Turnitin can be operate as a change artefact to promote developmental approaches to writing for assessment in higher education is questioned. The suitability of plagiarism detection software as a tool to promote writing development will be discussed in light of the findings from this inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{universities}} are being {{called upon to}} reach out beyond their walls and engage with potential collaborators on a myriad of activities. These expectations arise {{from a range of}} factors, many associated with the increasing prevalence of multi-party trans-disciplinary approaches for creating and activating knowledge to address challenges faced around the globe. To succeed in this emerging milieu, universities require a more refined capacity to engage in such collaborations. Vital to this development is a deeper and more nuanced understanding of what leadership means for such activity, and how it can be encouraged and strengthened. However, to date investigation related to universities' involvement in community engagement has been primarily descriptive, rather than theoretical in focus (Hart, et al., 2009). The present study seeks to advance theoretical understanding in this field by examining the university leadership associated with {{the development and implementation of}} community engagement <b>initiatives.</b> The <b>inquiry</b> builds upon Heifetz' (1994) broad view ofleadership as those actions taken within an organization to achieve desired outcomes, and Huxham and Vangen's (2005) concept of "leadership media", which encompasses the structures, processes and people that enable desired outcomes to be achieved within collaborative endeavours. The study adopts Strauss and Corbin's (1990) model of Grounded Theory as a primary methodology to develop this theoretical understanding. This approach was buttressed by multiple complementary methods for data collection and analysis to strengthen the robustness of the thesis. The principle data collection strategy was "convergent interviewing" (Dick, 2008). These findings were systematically compared and contrasted with data derived from secondary sources, survey research and a Delphi (i. e. expert) Panel. Data analysis combined grounded coding with quantitative analysis, visual mapping, narrative development and pattern matching. Findings revealed a multi-level model of leadership, comprised of key factors, both at an institutional (i. e. meso) and individual (micro) level, which appeared to activate and sustain members' involvement in community engagement. The model was conceptualized as the 'Capacity to Engage'. Aligning with Huxham and Vangen's leadership media and other contemporary leadership theory, this capacity provides the impetus and critical resources that facilitates members' initiation of and participation in such activities. Study implications are considered for further theory development and research, as well as policy and practice. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Making {{the inquiry}} into student {{learning}} {{a key component}} in Library and Information Science (LIS) education and increasing learning by fostering individual inquiry and developing a community that will support such an inquiry fits well within a field of LIS where dealing with inquiries {{on a daily basis}} is a major part of our work, providing more flexibility and developing and engaging in different communities of inquiry with {{people from all walks of}} life. The authors are trying to explore and demonstrate a strong connection between inquiry-based learning (IBL) concepts in LIS education and a development of scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL). Building the parallels between the Ernest Boyerâ s paradigm of scholarship and John Deweyâ s cycle of inquiry, they put forward an argument that inquiry-based learning in LIS is a new approach to a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in LIS education.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{recommendations in}} the literature on professional development, educational research that uses measures of student learning as criteria for determining the effectiveness of professional development is rare. Yet, teachers and schools are required by state and national legislation to document specific connections between professional development for teachers and improvements in student learning. This study addresses this gap by using qualitative methodology to examine the evidence that teachers provide as they reflect on their own learning, implement practices resulting from their learning, and assess ongoing improvements in student learning. This ethnographic study examines documents prepared anonymously by 140 teachers within a large urban high school as part of their participation in school-wide inservice sessions over one year and documents prepared by 12 key participants within voluntary professional development <b>initiatives</b> involving collaborative <b>inquiry,</b> action research, and portfolio development. Three key findings emerged from the study with implications for schools. First, the processes involved in collaborative inquiry, classroom research, and National Board for Professional Teaching Standards portfolio development are aligned with the features of effective learning environments identified by researchers (Bransford, Brown, 2 ̆ 6 Cocking, 2000; Guskey, 2003; NCREL, 1998) and professional organizations (NSDC, 2001). Second, teachers engaged in these professional learning experiences implement teaching practices that allow them to know their students better, use multiple and ongoing assessments of student learning, make adjustments to their teaching practices that are aligned with learner-centered classrooms, and express growing confidence in their abilities to differentiate instruction and assessment for diverse learners. Finally, teachers engaged in these forms of professional development—whether new or experienced teachers—are likely to deepen their levels of evidence-based reflective practice and broaden their understanding of diverse learning. The study concludes by identifying six key features of professional learning experiences that support teachers as they improve teaching practices and student learning in their classrooms. These six features, to be elaborated more fully in a second year of study, occur as recursive steps of professional learning through which teachers may develop their inquiry skills and teaching practices throughout their careers. ...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how a UK Secondary School {{introduced}} inquiry {{as a form}} {{of teacher}} professional development and focuses on the levels of engagement by the teachers in this type of development activity. The approach taken in this investigation centres on a qualitative case study focusing on a deep understanding of teachers’ beliefs, conceptions and experiences of inquiry engagement. Data was collected over an academic year by interviewing nine teachers and {{a senior member of the}} school leadership team at different stages throughout the academic year; by observing teachers in some of their classes and the staffroom; and by collecting internal documents and external public reports related to the school and the inquiry programme. The data was analysed using thematic coding which facilitated the identification and comparison of significant themes across all data sets. Findings from the research reveal that despite the school’s attempts to engage teachers in inquiry, the latter found it challenging to do so due to various factors. The analysis reveals the emerging factors of the conceptualisation of inquiry, availability of resources and ownership of the <b>inquiry</b> <b>initiative</b> and the impact of school culture on teachers’ inquiry engagement. The question of the appropriateness of inquiry {{as a form of}} professional development and the way it is facilitated in school emerges as a key theme. The study claims three main contributions to the field of teacher inquiry. Firstly, it proposes incorporating a micropolitical perspective of the school culture to investigate the realities of teachers’ inquiry work. The study argues through empirical illustration that such a perspective is likely to provide us with invaluable insights necessary to understand teachers’ conceptualisation of inquiry and their inquiry engagement. Secondly, this study proposes a categorisation of various types of teachers’ inquiry engagement. Such categorisation is likely to help us understand how and why teachers engage in inquiry and therefore the best ways to facilitate this type of professional development. Finally, the current study advances a framework illustrating various processes, interacting factors and main considerations in the context of inquiry as a form of professional development for teachers. The framework explains how teachers respond to an inquiry programme and the conditions that facilitate their inquiry engagement or otherwise. This contribution has practical implications for schools and practitioners interested in undertaking inquiry as a form of professional development. It is argued that the practical implications are likely to improve the planning and implementation of inquiry programmes in schools...|$|R
30|$|That one {{possesses}} connective {{knowledge of}} this sort, of course, {{is no guarantee that}} such connections will be made, or that if made, that they will be successful. As we highlighted earlier, {{there is a great deal}} of learning that occurs after the point of connection through interaction with other actors. In the context of futures research, myriad opportunities exist to act as critical springboards for situated learning of precisely this sort, including the European Foresight Program which is aimed at developing a global network binding together different communities and professionals [25]. For the present authors, such collaborative networks and partnerships provide opportunities for ongoing learning and dialogue that are non-substitutable. Yet, while we have treated as distinct different points of the collaborative life-cycle throughout this piece, notably distinguishing between cross-disciplinary collaborative engagement in progress, and the point of ‘envisioning’ as a prior point, it is worth our noting here that some forms of collaborative engagement can operate to blur that distinction in practice. In particular, it may be here that futures studies could play a powerful role in defying these boundaries. Innovative design <b>inquiry</b> <b>initiatives,</b> aimed at bridging ‘scientific understanding and community-based knowledge’ to reflect on ‘day-to-day realities and possible futures’ ([24], p. 57), as well as the increasing use of Living Labs for co-production and knowledge transfer work [55], provide unique participatory, problem/scenario-based, dialogical and transdisciplinary modes of engagement that could have extraordinary connective potential. To the extent to which futures studies initiatives render visible the range of human-technological contributions and sources that inform its work, these strike us as having unparalleled potential for enhancing ‘About Knowledge’. But this point about the visibility of sources of expertise is critical. In this sense, ‘About Knowledge’ is firmly about understanding where expertise lies (whether academics, organisational actors or actors within communities) and providing accessible examples of how different kinds of expertise play out in active, practical settings (as opposed to more granular field-specific ‘Of-Knowledge’). It is this step—seeing how expertise is enacted in different situations that present opportunities for understanding the role that different fields, specialisms, networks and actors could potentially make—that enables broader connections to be made. In this respect, the orientation of futures studies itself and the broad range of local and global challenges that it encompasses could serve to situate the field as a potentially important platform within and outside of higher education for the acquisition of ‘About-Knowledge’ and in turn, it maybe that the field provides an important method for how we unleash our connective capital.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{core business}} conflict that occurs amongst government agencies when working together in regional development projects and initiatives. The {{intent is to}} develop methods to manage this conflict and so enhance the delivery of regional development outcomes. The research problem explored is: ‘Government Department core business – managing the impact of potential conflicts on regional development projects and programs’ The research involves three discipline areas – Government and governance, public sector management practices, and regional development. Government agency (GA) core business is determined by Government and delivered using public sector management practices that have shaped individual agency’s strategic plans, processes and systems for core business delivery. Regional development involves multiple agencies delivering their core business outcomes that contribute to regional development. Due to the focus by each agency on their own core business, core business conflict can occur when agencies work together. A literature review did not uncover literature or research about GA core business conflict, therefore {{this is a new}} area of investigation. The literature studies and reports investigated and discussed a related area – issues and impediment to Whole-of- Government (WOG) and ‘joined-up’ government <b>initiatives.</b> A qualitative <b>inquiry</b> methodology is used to build knowledge about this new area. The sample of participants is drawn from GAs’ staff who are involved in regional development projects and programs, or projects and programs that contribute to regional development. Data collection is through interviews and surveys with GAs’ representatives from 18 agencies, across three levels of Government and from two distinctly different regions (coastal and inland). Two aspects of core business conflict are investigated – fundamental core business conflict that involves the underpinning philosophy and ideology of an agency, and functional/operational core business conflicts that include the strategic plans, policies, procedures and systems involved in delivery of core business, which also influence the design of program and project guidelines, and determine funding and staff resourcing. Research findings contribute new knowledge and expand current knowledge regarding challenges and barriers to agencies working together. Findings also enhance the application of approaches and tools to facilitate effective WOG and collaborative agency work. The research has resulted in a ‘process’ model to resolve the research problem that applies a holistic and comprehensive operational approach to addressing core business conflict. The ‘process’ model builds on the research findings and draws on information and tools from the literature. The research has implications for theory, policy and practice in the three discipline areas involved in the research problem and as a new area investigated, has generated further research opportunities...|$|R
