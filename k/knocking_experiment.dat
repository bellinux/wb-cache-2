40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to detect critical knock for a gasoline engine by the common method of knock diagnosis. In this paper, a new approach is presented to detect critical knock for gasoline engines. Based on this approach knock diagnosis consists of four steps. Firstly, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is chosen as a pre-processor for a neural network to extract knock characteristic signals; Secondly, four characteristic factors are selected and calculated from knock characteristic signals; Thirdly, degree of memberships of the characteristic factors are calculated as the input and output of the neural network; and finally a RBF(Radial Basis Function) neural network is chosen, trained and applied to detect critical <b>knock.</b> <b>Knock</b> <b>experiments</b> were performed on a gasoline engine, {{and the application of}} the presented approach was studied.

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports an {{investigation}} of detection of knock and misre in the spark ignition engine {{by means of the}} ionic current method. In the <b>knock</b> <b>experiments,</b> two detecting methods are used. One is the ionic current method. High frequency signals will be added to the ionic current signals where knocking is happening, which can be detected by picking up these signals. The other is the engine block vibration method. Knock can also be detected by monitoring signals of the vibration sensor in a proper position. The signals of the two kinds of methods are recorded at the same time with a dual-channel oscilloscope. With wave comparison and fast Fourier transform analy-sis, the advantages of the ionic current method can be shown and its feasibility and reliability can be proved further. In misre experiments, misre can occur by adjusting spark plug gap, adding carbon deposits and cutting out high voltages. A remarkable dierence exists between misre and non-misre ionic current signals in shape and amplitude. By detecting these changes, misre detection can be realized.

40|$|Experiments to {{identify}} the knock trends of lean gasoline-air mixtures, and such mixtures enhanced with hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO), were performed on a single-cylinder research engine with boosting capability. The experimental method used to investigate knock trends consisted of determining the octane number (ON) of the primary reference fuel (mixture of isooctane and n-heptane) supplied to the engine that just produced audible knock. All tests were completed at 1500 rpm, MBT spark timing, with coolant temperature at fully warmed-up conditions and intake air temperature at 200 C. Various relative air-fuel ratio (lambda) sweeps were performed, while holding different parameters constant. First, testing with primary reference fuels investigated knock limits of lean operation; selected tests were then repeated with H 2 and CO-enhancement. These mixtures simulated 15 % and 30 % of the engine's gasoline being reformed in a plasmatron fuel. reformer. Experimental results show that leaner operation does not decrease the knock tendency of an engine under conditions where a fixed output torque is maintained; rather it slightly increases the octane requirement. The onset of knock does decrease with lean operation when the intake pressure is held constant, but engine torque is then reduced. When H 2 and CO {{are added to the}} mixture, the knock susceptibility is reduced, as illustrated by a decrease in the measured octane number of the primary reference fuel resulting in <b>knock.</b> <b>Experiments</b> conducted with the addition of H 2 show similar trends, but to a lesser degree. Therefore, both H 2 and CO act as octane enhancers when added to a hydrocarbon-air mixture. The extent to which H 2 and CO improve the knock resistance of a mixture can be estimated by finding the bond-weighted octane number for the mixture of fuels. To substantiate these. results, a chemical kinetic ignition model was used to predict autoigntion of the end-gas for various conditions and fuel-air mixtures. Predicted model trends of knock onset partially agree with experimental observations.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue microarrays containing 798 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissue cores from two different institutes of pathology. TMAs were stained immunhistochemically for KPNA 2 and NBS 1. SiRNA technologies were used to inhibit KPNA 2 expression in vitro, {{and the effect of}} this inhibition on cellular viability was determined. Efficency of <b>knock</b> down <b>experiments</b> was determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: KPNA 2 expression was significantly upregulated in carcinomas of the prostate, especially in metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer samples. Positive nuclear KPNA 2 immunoreactivity was identified as a novel predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (n= 348), and was independent of the well-established predictive factors preoperative PSA value, Gleason score, tumor stage and surgical margin status. These results were validated by analyzing a second and independent prostate cancer cohort (n= 330). Further, in vitro experiments showed that the cell proliferation and viability of PC 3 cells was significantly reduced when KPNA 2 expression was inhibited. KPNA 2 knockdown did not induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage as marker for apoptosis. No significantly increased subG 1 fraction could be found by FACS analysis.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DEK mRNA and protein levels were evaluated in primary B-CLL samples (n = 21), p 53 (wild-type) SKW 6. 4, p 53 (mutated) BJAB lymphoblastoid cell lines, and normal CD 19 (+) B lymphocytes-treated Nutlin- 3 or chlorambucil (10 micromol/L, each). <b>Knocking</b> down <b>experiments</b> with either p 53 or DEK small interfering RNA (siRNA) were done to investigate the potential role of p 53 in controlling the expression of DEK and the role of DEK in leukemic cell survival/apoptosis. RESULTS: Both Nutlin- 3 and chlorambucil downregulated DEK in primary B-CLL samples (n = 21) and SKW 6. 4 but not in BJAB cells. Knocking down p 53 attenuated the effect of Nutlin- 3 on DEK expression, whereas knocking down DEK significantly increased both spontaneous and Nutlin- 3 -induced apoptosis. Conversely, counteracting DEK downmodulation by using p 53 small interfering RNA reduced Nutlin- 3 -mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, Nutlin- 3 potently induced p 53 accumulation, but it did not affect DEK levels in normal CD 19 (+) B lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the downregulation of DEK in response to either Nutlin- 3 or chlorambucil represents an important molecular determinant in the cytotoxic response of leukemic cells, and suggest that strategies aimed to downregulate DEK might improve the therapeutic potential of these drugs...|$|R

As con-firmed by TLR 2 -/- <b>knock</b> out <b>experiments,</b> {{these results suggest that}} BoNT/A induces global gene expression changes in host immune cells and that host responses to BoNT/A proceed through a TLR 2 -dependent pathway, which is modulated by JNK, ERK, and p 38 MAPK...|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure that}} the engines {{to be used in}} LNG-fueled {{vehicles}} are matched with the expected variations in fuel composition, the knock resistance of the fuel must be determined unambiguously. Rather than rely on empirical methods using gas mixtures and “standard” engines traditionally employed for this purpose, we have derived a method based on the combustion properties of the fuel mixtures, and have developed a first-generation calculation tool for LNG fuels. Engine knock is characterized by autoignition of the unburned fuel mixture, the so-called end gas, ahead of the propagating flame in the engine cylinder. The core of the new method described in this paper is the computation of the autoignition process during the compression and burn periods of the engine cycle. The method’s detailed chemical mechanism describing autoignition has been tested against experimentally determined autoignition delay times of the alkanes up to pentane (including the isomers of butane and pentane), hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, measured in our Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). In addition to the effects on autoignition itself, the effects of fuel composition on the in-cylinder pressure and temperature conditions relevant for knocking, such as changes in heat capacity of the air-fuel mixture and changes in the phasing of the combustion process are also incorporated in the method. We first report the testing and optimization of the method’s chemical model, based on measurements of the autoignition delay time in DNV GL’s RCM. We then present the method to predict the pressure and temperature history of the end gas upon changes in gas composition, using a two-zone thermodynamic model. Combining both methods into an “integrated” model, we derive a propane-based scale (Propane Knock Index, PKI) for ranking the knock resistance of different gases for DNV GL’s lean-burn, spark-ignited gas engine. We demonstrate that the prediction of autoignition of the end gas using the integrated model is adequate for predicting knock with varying fuel compositions by comparing the computed PKI with the Knock-Limited Spark Timing measured in the DNV GL engine, for hydrocarbon mixtures relevant for LNG and natural gas. Further, we compare the results with those obtained using a methane number method. We also report a first-generation algorithm, an easy-to-use, gas-input-only tool to predict the knock resistance for LNG fuels for our engine. The tool is based explicitly on the performance characteristics of our engine and the fuels studied thus far. The extension of the tool to the LNG-for-transportation market will require analyses of other engine types, such as stoichiometric and dual-fuel engines. While traditional knock resistance ranking tools rely on empirical methods using a single “standard” engine, our method is based on the unique approach of using the elementary physical and chemical processes to describe the macroscopic behavior of engines. This paper presents the first application of the method in a quantitative ranking tool, the PKI, and verifies its predictions against <b>knock</b> <b>experiments</b> in a practical engine. Thus, a new, physically “correct” method for characterizing the knock resistance of gaseous fuels based on the physical and chemical properties of the fuel, and their effects on in-cylinder processes, has been developed and its first application in a calculation tool for ranking the knock resistance of LNG fuels is presented. The methodology being developed is readily extended to different engine types and fuels, and is therefore flexible (adaptable to several applications) and sustainable (able to develop together with new engine technologies) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nucleolin {{is a major}} {{nucleolar}} phosphoprotein {{involved in}} various steps of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. As nucleolin {{plays a significant role}} in ribosomal RNA transcription we were interested in examining in detail the expression of nucleolin across different stages of spermatogenesis and correlate with the transcription status of ribosomal DNA in germ cells. Results By RT PCR and western blot analysis we found that nucleolin is strongly down regulated in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid germ cells. We have identified a new nucleolin related protein (NRP) gene in the rat genome, which is over expressed in the testis and is up regulated several fold in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid germ cells. The NRP protein lacks the acidic stretches in its N terminal domain, and it is encoded in rat chromosome 15 having a different genomic organization as compared to nucleolin gene present on chromosome 9. We have also found NRP genes encoded in genomes of other mammalian species. We performed run-on transcription assay where we have observed that rDNA is transcribed at much lower level in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid spermatids as compared to diploid cells. By siRNA <b>knock</b> down <b>experiments</b> we could also demonstrate that NRP can support rDNA transcription in the absence of nucleolin. Conclusion We have identified a new nucleolin variant over expressed in germ cells in rat and analyzed its domain structure. We attribute that the transcriptional activity of rDNA genes in the late spermatogenesis is due to the presence of this variant NRP. The expression of this variant in the germ cells in the absence of nucleolin, could have additional functions in the mammalian spermatogenesis which needs to be investigated further. </p...|$|R
40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common extracranial solid tumour in children, with a high {{mortality}} rate among patients with aggressive disease. In a previous study we showed that Clusterin (CLU) inhibits the transcription factor NF-ϰB in a neuroblastoma cell line by stabilizing the NF-ϰB inhibitors (IϰBs). Moreover, suppression of CLU could elicit NF-ϰB activation and increased the expression of markers for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental process utilized by aggressive cancer cells for invasion, in a mouse neuroblastoma model. The expression of CLU is also negatively regulated by the proto-oncogene MYCN, which is associated with aggressive stages of neuroblastoma tumours. Thus, we hypothesised that CLU is a tumour suppressor gene, which negatively regulates NF-ϰB and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the role of the different isoforms of CLU in the regulation of signalling pathways. We also aimed at identifying the precise mechanisms by which CLU regulates NF-ϰB. The results show that intracellular, but not secreted CLU, inhibits NF-ϰB activity. Interestingly, extracellular CLU (secreted CLU) positively regulates AKT and the Phosphoinositide- 3 Kinase (PI 3 K) pathway. Mass-spectrometry analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a chaperone protein named Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP 60) is bound to the N-terminal region of intracellular CLU in neuroblastoma cells. Suppression of HSP 60 by shRNA <b>knock</b> down <b>experiments</b> caused decreased neuroblastoma cell proliferation and increased cell death. Our results suggest that HSP 60 exert its oncogenic activity by inhibiting the function of CLU and promoting NF-κB activity. In summary, in this report we demonstrate that a direct interaction between intracellular CLU and HSP 60 could {{play an important role in}} the regulation of NF-κB activity and neuroblastoma development...|$|R
40|$|History and Objectives: First step in {{chemical}} control of arthropod is {{assessment of their}} sensitivity to insecticides {{the present study is}} designed {{to determine the extent of}} sensitivity of cockroaches obtained from Shaheed Beheshti, Naghavi and Shabihkhani hospitals in Kashan to phosphorous, pyrothroid and carbamate insecticides in 1995 - 96. Materials and Methods: Cockroaches were obtained by hand and trap. After 48 hours of in the laboratory, they were tested on the basis of WHO directives and by contact method and <b>knock</b> down <b>experiments.</b> Regression lines were calculated for KT 50 and KT 90 and level sensitivity was compared. Results: The effect of Actlic insecticide (0. 12 g/mÂ²) on American cockroaches gathered from Naghavi and Shabihkhani compared to Shaheed Beheshti showed resistance ratio of 1. 06 and 1. 07 respectively. The effect of Sulfac insecticide (0. 2 g/mÂ²) on cockroaches obtained from Naghavi and Shabihkhani compared to the Shaheed Beheshti hospital showed resistance ratio of 2. 3 and 2. 1 respectively. Similar comparison of Coopex insecticide (0. 125 g/mÂ²) showed ratio of resistance of 3. 04 and 1. 64 respectively. This comparison for Ficom insecticide (0. 24 g/mÂ²) gave 1. 25 and 1. 18 ratio resistance for Naghavi and Shabihkhani hospitals compared to Shaheed Beheshti hospital. One hundred percent mortality and morbidity of species under examination was obtained for all insecticide after 24 hours of contact. Conclusion: It seems the repeated use of insecticides in Naghavi and Shabihkhani hospitals, which compared to the Shaheed Beheshti hospital are older has increased the level of tolerance of cockroaches considerably. Insects at Naghavi and Shabihkhani have been under stress and overuse of insecticides and have developed tolerance of some insecticides...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) is a {{pleiotropic}} factor {{acting on}} cells expressing the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. HGF/Met signaling {{has been described}} in detail and it is known to control cell migration, growth and differentiation in several embryonic organs and to be implicated in human cancer. Conversely, {{little is known about}} the transcriptional targets that lead to Met-mediated biological functions. Also, {{little is known about the}} physiological mechanisms that attenuate Met signaling. This work provides the results of a screen for genes transcriptionally regulated by Met in several cell lines and addresses the functions of the highly inducible gene Mig 6 (Mitogen-inducible-gene 6, also called Gene 33 and RALT). By the use of Met loss of function mutant mice Met is shown to be the major inducer of mig 6 in hepatocytes and lungs of E 13. 5 embryos. Mig 6 is shown in turn to negatively regulate HGF/Met-induced cell migration. The effect is observed by Mig 6 overexpression and reversed by Mig 6 siRNA <b>knock</b> down <b>experiments</b> indicating that endogenous Mig 6 is part of a mechanism that inhibits Met signaling. Mig 6 functions in cells of hepatic origin and in neurons suggesting a role for Mig 6 in different cell lineages. Mechanistically, Mig 6 requires an intact Cdc 42 /Rho interactive binding (CRIB) domain to exert its inhibitory action suggesting that Mig 6 acts at least in part distally from Met possibly by sequestering Rho-like GTPases. Because Mig 6 is also induced by HGF stimulation, this work provides evidence that Mig 6 is part of a negative feedback loop that attenuates Met functions in different contexts and cell types...|$|R
