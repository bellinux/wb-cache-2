5|$|Opinions of Hamilton {{have run}} the gamut: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic. Hamilton's {{reputation}} was mostly negative in the eras of Jeffersonian democracy and <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy.</b> By the Progressive era, Herbert Croly, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt praised his leadership {{of a strong}} government. Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century Republicans entered politics by writing laudatory biographies of Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|From 1820 to 1850, <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> began a set {{of reforms}} which {{included}} wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E

50|$|The Democrats who {{rallied to}} Martin Van Buren's Free Soil Party in 1848 {{have been studied}} by Earle (2003). Their views on race {{occupied}} a wide spectrum, but {{they were able to}} fashion new and vital arguments against slavery and its expansion based on the <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy's</b> long-standing commitment to egalitarianism and hostility to centralized power. Linking their antislavery stance to a land-reform agenda that pressed for free land for poor settlers—realized by the Homestead Law of 1862—in addition to land free of slavery, Free Soil Democrats forced major political realignments in New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Ohio. Democratic politicians such as Wilmot, Marcus Morton, John Parker Hale, and even former president Van Buren were transformed into antislavery leaders. Many entered the new Republican party after 1854, bringing along Jacksonian ideas about property and political equality, helping transform antislavery from a struggling crusade into a mass political movement that came to power in 1860.|$|R
40|$|The {{journal and}} letters written by Edward Bliss Emerson in the Caribbean provide exciting, idyllic, {{and at times}} {{troublesome}} visions of that region, but also insights {{on the life of}} a sick, poor, religious and brilliant young man. Emerson’s reflections on life in St. Croix remain unquoted, and although brief excerpts from the Puerto Rico portion of the journal appeared in print in 1959 and 1991, his more extensive text supplements the contemporary publications, which only praised the colonial administration. A third, and equally important location, is the implicit base for his perspective – New England in the period of <b>Jacksonian</b> populist <b>democracy.</b> The journal presents terse reminders of daily activities, mixed with extensive descriptions of landscape, exotic civic and religious observances, business and social customs, fruits, music and sports, with personal meditations on Edward’s readings, his search for health, and his adaptation to a new life away from his family, with little prospect of wealth or longevity. His letters include periodic reckonings of the benefits and disadvantages that he saw to life in Puerto Rico. This diverse eyewitness account represents an important resource for researchers of Caribbean society and culture...|$|R
25|$|In Democracy in America, {{published}} in 1835, Tocqueville {{wrote of the}} New World and its burgeoning democratic order. Observing {{from the perspective of}} a detached social scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through America in the early 19th century when the market revolution, Western expansion, and <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> were radically transforming the fabric of American life.|$|E
25|$|James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 – June 15, 1849) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 11th President of the United States (1845–1849). He previously was elected the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives (1835–1839) and Governor of Tennessee (1839–1841). As a protégé of Andrew Jackson, Polk {{was a member of the}} Democratic Party and an advocate of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> and Manifest Destiny. During his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the annexation of the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Treaty, and the close of the Mexican-American War.|$|E
25|$|Political {{machines}} appeared {{early in}} the history of the United States, and for all the exhortations of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates. In addition, the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists, and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate. As a consequence, the chance of single issue and ideology-based candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituencies.|$|E
25|$|A {{formative}} {{event in}} {{the early history of}} New Orleans was the Battle of New Orleans. This battle, fought during the War of 1812, enhanced the political career of Andrew Jackson, who, along with Martin Van Buren, in turn founded the Democratic Party. Jackson began a new political movement now known as the <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy.</b> This new direction in American politics had a profound influence on the development of New Orleans and the American Southwest. One of these developments was the construction of Fort Jackson, Louisiana, a star fort suggested by and named after Jackson. This fortress was intended to support Fort St. Philip and bar the Mississippi Delta from invasion. The presidents of the <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> supported the concept of manifest destiny, greatly expanding acquisition of territory in the American Southwest and the support of international trade along with the spread of slavery. This powerful political movement also produced sectional tension between the northern and southern halves of the United States, resulting {{in the creation of the}} Whig Party to oppose the new Democratic Party. As the political rivalry between the Jacksonian Democrats and the Whigs intensified, the Republican Party was founded, to counter the spread of slavery into states produced by territorial conquests of the Jacksonian Democrats. The victory of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican presidential candidate, in the election of 1860, resulted in the secession crisis and the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Monroe {{supported}} {{the founding of}} colonies in Africa for freed slaves that would eventually form the nation of Liberia, whose capital, Monrovia, is named in his honor. In 1823, he announced the United States' opposition to any European intervention in the recently independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign policy. His presidency concluded the first period of American presidential history {{before the beginning of}} <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> and the Second Party System era. Following his retirement in 1825, Monroe was plagued by financial difficulties. He died in New York City on July 4, 1831. He has been ranked in the aggregate by scholars as the 16th most successful president.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1820s, American {{politics}} {{became more}} democratic as many {{state and local}} offices went from being appointed to elective, and the old requirements for voters to own property were abolished. Voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties, and by the 1830s in every state except South Carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters. <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy</b> drew its support from the small farmers of the West, and the workers, artisans and small merchants of the East. They favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them, and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an industrial nation built on finance and manufacturing. The entrepreneurs, for whom Henry Clay and Daniel Webster were heroes, fought back and formed the Whig party.|$|E
25|$|After 1800, {{cotton and}} tobacco became {{important}} export crops. The {{eastern half of}} the state, especially the Tidewater region, developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor. Many free people of color migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly 3 percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of Jeffersonian and <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy,</b> with a strong Whig presence, especially in the West. After Nat Turner's slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} presidential elections, state legislative choice {{was the most}} common method of choosing electors. A majority of the state legislatures selected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of them did so in 1812. Even in the 1824 election, a quarter of state legislatures (6 of 24) chose electors. In that election, Andrew Jackson lost in spite of having pluralities of both the popular and electoral votes, with the outcome being decided by the six state legislatures choosing the electors. Some state legislatures simply chose electors, while other states used a hybrid method in which state legislatures chose from a group of electors elected by popular vote. By 1828, with the rise of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy,</b> only Delaware and South Carolina used legislative choice. Delaware ended its practice the following election (1832), while South Carolina continued using the method until it seceded from the Union in December 1860. South Carolina used the popular vote {{for the first time in}} the 1868 election.|$|E
25|$|Charismatic Andrew Jackson, by contrast, in {{collaboration}} with strategist Martin Van Buren rallied his followers in the newly emerging Democratic Party. In the election of 1828, Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration's policies. The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier, with Jackson and Adams's camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations at one another. The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued {{that he was a}} man of education and social grace against an uncouth, semi-literate backwoodsman. This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition, owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property. The election saw the coming to power of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> thus marking the transition from the First Party System (which reflected Jeffersonian Democracy) to the Second Party System. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics, with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system.|$|E
25|$|After a brief retirement, Clay won {{election}} to the House in 1822, and began considering his first presidential bid. By 1822, {{several members of the}} dominant Democratic-Republican Party had begun exploring presidential bids to succeed Monroe, who planned to retire after two terms like his predecessors. The Federalist Party had almost totally collapsed at this point, and the party failed to put forth a presidential candidate. Re-elected as Speaker in 1823, Clay passed the Tariff of 1824 and the General Survey Act, and Clay campaigned on his American System of high tariffs and federal spending on infrastructure. As the election approached, three members of Monroe's Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, appeared to be Clay's strongest competitors for the presidency. In 1822, the Tennessee legislature elected General Andrew Jackson to the Senate, and his backers also began to prepare for a presidential candidacy. Though many (including Clay) did not take his candidacy seriously at first, Jackson's emergence threatened Clay's presidential chances, since both candidates had a strong following in the western states. Jackson's supporters devised new campaign strategies by building grassroots networks that bypassed party bosses, signalling the rise of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy.</b> Crawford won the Republican congressional nominating caucus, which had decided previous Republican nominees, but the caucus had come {{to be seen as a}} vestige of elitism and Crawford's caucus victory actually hurt his popularity. In the Fall of 1823, Crawford suffered a major stroke, while Calhoun withdrew after Jackson won the support of the Pennsylvania legislature. The 1824 election thus had four major candidates, all of them Democratic-Republicans: Adams of Massachusetts, Crawford of Georgia, Jackson of Tennessee, and Clay of Kentucky. Ideologically, Adams and Clay both supported a relatively strong federal government, while Crawford and Jackson tended to oppose federal infrastructure projects, instead favoring stronger state governments.|$|E
500|$|Freemasonry in the United States faced {{political}} pressure following the 1826 kidnapping of William Morgan by Freemasons and subsequent disappearance. Reports of the [...] "Morgan Affair", together with opposition to <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> (Andrew Jackson {{was a prominent}} Mason) helped fuel an Anti-Masonic movement, culminating {{in the formation of}} a short lived Anti-Masonic Party which fielded candidates for the Presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.|$|E
500|$|David Potter {{concludes that}} the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were [...] "the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration... Both brought down an {{avalanche}} of public criticism." [...] More important, says Potter, they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] as political doctrines. Historian Kenneth Nivison, writing in 2010, takes a more favorable view of Pierce's foreign policy, stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, who served {{at a time when}} America had the military might to make her desires stick. [...] "American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s, which eventually supplanted European colonialism {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, owed much to the paternalism of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy</b> cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce." ...|$|E
500|$|Offitt, at birth, {{was given}} the {{forenames}} Andrew Jackson, which according to Hay shows that the bearer [...] "is the son of illiterate parents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history". Hay despised President Jackson and <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy,</b> which he deemed corrupt and responsible for {{the continuation of the}} slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. [...] He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners [...] "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw no excuse for violence; as {{the will of the people}} could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election. According to Gale, Hay [...] "never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish"—they are depicted as talkative and easily led (Offitt writes for the Irish Harp), and the reader is told that [...] "there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his ward club as well as to mass".|$|E

2500|$|Upon foundation, the Democratic Party {{supported}} agrarianism, and the <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> {{movement of}} President Andrew Jackson, representing farmers and rural interests, and traditional Jeffersonian democrats. Since the 1890s, {{the party has}} favored liberal positions (the term [...] "liberal" [...] in this sense describes modern liberalism, rather than classical liberalism or economic liberalism). In recent exit polls, the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.|$|E
2500|$|Before industrialization, [...] "yeoman farmers"—self-sufficient, {{politically}} independent landowners—made up a {{large portion}} of the country's population. Jeffersonian democracy and <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> successfully expanded the political rights of the yeomen, and the geographical extent of the nation to provide them farms. This culminated in the Homestead Act of 1862 which provided hundreds of thousands of free farms. Before 1865 large southern plantations used slaves. After emancipation, a system of sharecropping and tenant farming for both whites and blacks in the South provided a semi-independent status for farmers who did not own their land. In contemporary times, migrant agricultural workers—mostly Mexicans—perform field and packing work.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1830s, the Whig Party {{emerged as}} the {{national}} conservative party. Whigs supported the national bank, private business interests, and the modernization {{of the economy in}} opposition to <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy,</b> which represented the interests of poor farmers and the urban working class, represented by the newly formed Democratic Party. They chose the name [...] "Whig" [...] because it had been used by patriots in the Revolution.

2500|$|Journalist John L.

This destiny was not explicitly territorial, but O'Sullivan predicted that the United States {{would be one of}} a [...] "Union of many Republics" [...] sharing those values.|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, in {{his early}} years Noah Webster himself was a proponent of the American ideals of [...] "liberalism" [...] and [...] "tolerance" [...] but in 1808 he became a convert to Calvinistic orthodoxy, and {{thereafter}} became a devout Congregationalist who preached the need to Christianize the nation. [...] Webster grew increasingly authoritarian and elitist, fighting against the prevailing grain of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy.</b> Webster viewed language {{as a tool to}} control unruly thoughts. His American Dictionary emphasized the virtues of social control over human passions and individualism, submission to authority, and fear of God; they were necessary for the maintenance of the American social order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{democracy}} opened {{the ballot box}} to nearly all white men, allowing the <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> to dominate politics during the Second Party System. Whigs, representing wealthier planters, merchants, financiers, and professionals, wanted to modernize the society, using tariffs and federally funded internal improvements; they were blocked by the Jacksonians, who closed down the national Bank in the 1830s. The Jacksonians wanted expansion—that is [...] "Manifest Destiny"—into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters. Thanks to the annexation of Texas, the defeat of Mexico in war, and a compromise with Britain, the western third of the nation rounded out the continental United States by 1848.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{name has}} been {{associated}} with <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. [...] "The Age of Jackson" [...] shaped the national agenda and American politics. Jackson's philosophy as President was similar to that of Thomas Jefferson, advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation. Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption. He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law, he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} Vernon Louis Parrington in 1928 won the Pulitzer Prize for Main Currents in American Thought. It was {{a highly}} influential intellectual history of America from the colonial era to the early 20th century. It was well written and passionate {{about the value of}} Jeffersonian democracy and helped identify and honor liberal heroes and their ideas and causes. Parrington argued in 1930 that, [...] "For upwards of half a century creative political thinking in America was largely western agrarian, and from this source came those democratic ideas that were to provide the staple of a later liberalism." [...] In 1945, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., argued in The Age of Jackson that liberalism also emerged from <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy</b> and the labor radicalism of the Eastern cities, thereby linking it to the urban dimension of Roosevelt's New Deal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spectacle}} of a landed gentleman living in semi-feudal splendor among his 3,000 tenants was an anachronism to a postwar generation {{that had become}} acclimated to <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy.</b> Stephen III's leniency toward his tenants had created a serious problem for his heirs. His will directed them to collect and apply the back rents (approximately $400,000) toward the payment of the patroon's debts. As soon as the rent notices went out, the farmers organized committees and held public meetings in protest. Stephen IV, who had inherited the [...] "West Manor" [...] (Albany County), refused {{to meet with a}} committee of anti-renters and turned down their written request for a reduction of rents. His brusque refusal infuriated the farmers. On July 4, 1839, a mass meeting at Berne called for a declaration of independence from landlord rule but raised the amount the tenants were willing to pay.|$|E
2500|$|... {{underwent}} {{fundamental change}} after 1820 {{under the rubric}} of <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy.</b> While Jackson himself did not initiate the changes, he took advantage in 1828 and symbolized many of the changes. For the first time politics assumed a central role in voters' lives. Before then deference to upper class elites, and general indifference most of the time, characterized local politics across the country. [...] The suffrage laws were not at fault for they allowed mass participation; rather few men were interested in politics before 1828, and fewer still voted or became engaged because politics did not seem important. [...] Changes followed the psychological shock of the panic of 1819, and the 1828 election of Andrew Jackson, with his charismatic personality and controversial policies. By 1840, Gienapp argues, the revolution was complete: [...] "With the full establishment of the second party system, campaigns were characterized by appeals to the common man, mass meetings, parades, celebrations, and intense enthusiasm, while elections generated high voter participation. In structure and ideology, American politics had been democratized." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{expansion}} of migration into the Southeastern United States in the 1820s to the 1830s forced {{the federal government}} to deal with the [...] "Indian question". The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new Democratic Party of President Andrew Jackson demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the Whig Party and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>Democracy</b> proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the [...] "Indian Removal policy" [...] began, to implement the act of Congress signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson. The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards. Jackson justified his actions by stating that Indians had [...] "neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of improvements".|$|E
2500|$|Born in Salisbury, New Hampshire, Webster {{was one of}} {{the most}} highly {{regarded}} courtroom lawyers of the era and shaped several key U.S. Supreme Court cases that established important constitutional precedents that bolstered the authority of the federal government. Webster entered politics during the era of the Second Party System, which was the political system in the United States from about 1828 to 1854, characterized by rapidly increasing voter interest and personal loyalty to parties. Webster served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He was identified with the National Republican Party and supported John Quincy Adams. He took his seat in the Senate in 1827. As a senator, Webster was an outstanding spokesman for American nationalism with powerful oratory that made him a key Whig leader. His explication of the United States as not a creation of individual states but a cohesive whole in itself strengthened the power and integrity of the Union during the Nullification Crisis. He spoke for conservatives and led the opposition to Democrat Andrew Jackson and his Democratic Party, firmly challenging Jackson's policies in the Bank War. Webster was a spokesman for modernization, banking, and industry, but not for the common people who composed the base of his opponents in <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>democracy.</b> [...] "He was a thoroughgoing elitist, and he reveled in it," [...] says biographer Robert Remini.|$|E
