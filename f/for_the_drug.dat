5|$|The Echo has won {{numerous}} accolades, as well {{as government}} praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting {{the threat posed by}} bogus callers to the elderly and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in Parliament. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The Newspaper Society named the Echo as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drug</b> Busters drive, and the campaign also won an award from the International Newspaper Marketing Association.|$|E

5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E

25|$|Designing {{safe and}} {{effective}} antiviral drugs is difficult, because viruses use the host's cells to replicate.

Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral drugs is due to viral variation.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{shipments}} {{are often}} delayed in Mexican border towns before delivery to the US, which has forced drug traffickers to increase prices {{to account for}} transportation costs of products across international borders, making it a more profitable business <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> lords, and has likely contributed to the increased rates of local drug consumption.|$|E

25|$|Oral {{nicotinamide}} {{has been}} promoted as an over-the-counter drug {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.|$|E
40|$|Pulsatile drug {{delivery}} system is the most interesting time- and site-specific system. This system is designed for chronopharmacotherapy {{which is based on}} circadian rhythm. <b>The</b> principle rationale <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of pulsatile release is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> where a constant drug release, i. e., a zero-order release is not desired. Pulsatile {{drug delivery}} system is defined as the rapid and transient release of certain amount of molecules within a short time period immediately after a predetermined off-release period, i. e., lag time. Various systems like capsular systems, osmotic systems, pulsatile system based on the use of soluble or erodible polymer coating, use of rupturable membranes and pulsatile system based on membrane permeability are summarized in this article. These systems are beneficial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> having chronopharmacological behavior where night time dosing is required and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> having high first-pass effect and having specific site of absorption in gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

Several days following this demonstration, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT to $6,400 per patient per year.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Hanson (then Pauline Seccombe) married Walter Zagorski, {{a former}} field {{representative}} and mining industry labourer from Poland. Zagorski {{and his mother}} had escaped war-torn Europe and arrived in Australia as refugees, and met Hanson when they met while both working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drug</b> Houses of Australia subsidiary Taylors Elliots Ltd. They had two children: Anthony (born 1972) and Steven (born 1975). In 1975, Hanson left Zagorski after discovering that he had been involved in several extramarital affairs. They reconciled briefly in 1977, but divorced later that year when Zagorski left Hanson for another woman.|$|E
25|$|Galindo Mellado Cruz (also Galdino) {{was born}} in Tampico Alto, Veracruz, Mexico on 18 April 1973. According to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA), Mellado Cruz joined the Mexican Armed Forces as {{a soldier in the}} Mexican Army on 1 September 1992. During his tenure in the military, {{he was part of the}} Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), an elite special forces unit of the Army, where he {{received}} top military training. On 1 May 1999, however, he applied to be discharged from the Army. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the Gulf Cartel, a Mexican drug trafficking organization, and began working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> kingpin Osiel Cárdenas Guillén along with several other ex-commandos from the Army.|$|E

25|$|General {{anesthesia}} is not maintained with barbiturate drugs. An induction dose of thiopental {{wears off}} {{after a few}} minutes because the thiopental redistributes from the brain {{to the rest of the}} body very quickly. However, it has a long half-life, which means that a long time is needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> to be eliminated from the body. If a very large initial dose is given, little or no redistribution takes place (since the body is saturated with the drug), which means that recovery of consciousness requires the drug to be eliminated from the body, which is not only slow (taking many hours or days), but unpredictable in duration, making barbiturates very unsatisfactory for maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2007, at the Tour of Elk Grove, O'Neill {{provided}} a sample which {{tested positive for}} the appetite suppressant drug phentermine. O'Neill received notification of this on 23 September 2007. Later, the B sample also tested positive, he admitted that he had used the medicine for the prescribed purpose out of competition. The drug was not banned for use out-of-competition, and O'Neill maintains that his error is due to a longer than expected clearance time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> compounded by another supplement which increased his urinary pH that he was also taking {{in the days leading up}} to the event. On 6 November 2007, O'Neill was terminated by the Health Net Pro Cycling Team.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the revenue}} of the Gulf Cartel is often laundered in several bank accounts, properties, vehicles, and {{gasoline}} stations. Bars and casinos are often the hubs for money laundering of the drug cartels. Top leaders of the Gulf organization, like Juan García Ábrego, Osiel Cárdenas, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, and Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, among others, have been charged by the U.S. government for laundering millions of dollars. Bank accounts inside the United States also launder millions of dollars <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> lords of the Gulf Cartel. The Economist mentioned in 1997 that the drug money from the Gulf Cartel in the Rio Grande Valley was perhaps moving about $20 billion, and that around 15% of the retailers' gains were from drug money.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>drug</b> use {{of nearly}} 2, 000 {{pregnant}} women was evaluated {{at the level}} of <b>the</b> individual patient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> belonging to <b>the</b> Australian risk categories B 3, C and D. The pattern of changes in the use of these drugs is studied in terms of women who discontinue (d), continue (c) or begin (b) using <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> during pregnancy. <b>The</b> ratios d/(c + b) and d/b were <b>the</b> highest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> belonging to <b>the</b> high-risk groups and <b>the</b> lowest <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> from <b>the</b> low-risk categories. This suggests a congruence between theoretical knowledge and daily practice. Patients who had already been using a drug {{for a long time before}} pregnancy, more frequently continued using that drug than patients who had been using <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> only incidentally before. The described daily dose <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riskful <b>drugs</b> was approximately 20 % lower in patients who started to use a drug during pregnancy compared to those who continued <b>drug</b> use. <b>The</b> data from this analysis indicate that the prescribing physician is generally aware of the possible risks of drug use during pregnancy. The d/(b + c) and d/b ratios are shown to be a good measure of prescribing behaviour in relation to pregnancy and can be used to compare knowledge of theory and daily practice...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{nanoparticles}} {{were shown}} to take up by phagocytic cells and held promises as carrier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> treatment of intracellular infections with several antibiotics [12]. It was reported that Gnps as drug carriers allow increased drug concentration at infected sites as well as reduce toxicity of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> [13]. Thus, Gnps as carrier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> antibacterial <b>drug</b> ciprofloxacin and subsequent release of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> {{over an extended period}} of time was observed [14]. This is essential for ideal antibiotic therapy. Nano carriers were also found to be more effective <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> like gentamycin [15], tuberculosis drugs [16, 17], ampicillin [18 – 20], anticancer drugs [21, 22], anti fungal drug amphotericin B [23] etc.|$|R
