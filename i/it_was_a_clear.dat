5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{declaration}} of war, but Nikephoros' forces were largely preoccupied in the East. Thus the emperor {{turned to the}} traditional Byzantine expedient of turning one of the peoples living further north, in modern-day Ukraine, against Bulgaria. He sent an ambassador, the patrikios Kalokyros, to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus' with whom the Byzantines had maintained close relations. Sviatoslav enthusiastically responded, and invaded Bulgaria in 967 or 968 in a devastating raid, before returning home to defend his capital against a Pecheneg attack. This forced the Bulgarian tsar, Peter I, to the negotiating table, agreeing to terms favourable to Byzantium. However, this brief sojourn also awakened in Sviatoslav the desire to conquer Bulgaria and establish his own realm there. He returned in force in July or August 969 and conquered the country within a few months.|$|E
25|$|Autari {{was then}} able {{to engage in}} the {{reorganization}} of the Lombards and their settlement in a stable form in Italy. He assumed, like the Ostrogoth Kings, the title of Flavio, with which he intended to proclaim himself also protector of all Romans on its territory: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> call, with anti-Byzantine overtones, to the heritage of the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|The coup’s {{significance}} extended {{well beyond}} the country’s boundaries as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> marker along the already well-advanced road to full-fledged Cold War. The event alarmed Western countries and helped spur quick adoption of the Marshall Plan, {{the creation of a}} state in West Germany, vigorous measures to keep communists out of power in France and especially Italy, and steps toward mutual security that would, in little over a year, result in the establishment of NATO and the definitive drawing of the Iron Curtain until the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E

25|$|In April 1999, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher {{and former}} US President George H. W. Bush called upon the British {{government}} to release Pinochet. They urged that Pinochet {{be allowed to}} return to his homeland rather than be forced to go to Spain. On the other hand, United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights, Mary Robinson, hailed the Lords' ruling, declaring that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> endorsement that torture is an international crime subject to universal jurisdiction. Furthermore, Amnesty International and the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture demanded his extradition to Spain. Finally, in protest against Spain's action, Chile withdrew for a time its ambassador from Madrid.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his {{appointment}} to the bench, the position was seen as particularly risky, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> representation of anti-British authority whose placeholders were thought to be risking their lives should the British succeed in putting down the rebellion. [...] The most noteworthy case Sullivan sat on was a preliminary hearing in Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison, one of the Quock Walker cases where the court in 1783 decided that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution. [...] Sullivan publicly expressed opposition to slavery, and predicted in his writings that the issue would become contentious in the future.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of}} the netting.

500|$|Arthur Bassett {{made his}} report to Chang Yin Tang, the Chinese Minister to Mexico, on 13 July, after {{conducting}} interviews {{with a number}} of Chinese and Mexican witnesses to the massacre. [...] He concluded that the Maderistas' claims (that they had been fired on by the Chinese) were false, citing the 12 May circular by the reform society. [...] He also dismissed the claim that the immigrants had been armed by General Lojero and his retreating Federales, pointing out that the reason for the evacuation was a dearth of ammunition. [...] Furthermore, no witnesses reported any form of resistance by the Chinese. [...] In his report, he called the incident [...] "an unprovoked massacre... conceived in malice and race hatred" [...] and concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> violation of the 1899 treaty between the two countries.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson was {{a leading}} member of the legal team {{assisting}} Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller during the failed prosecution of alleged serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams in 1957. The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised, and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a nolle prosequi was scathingly described by the trial judge, Patrick Devlin, as [...] "an abuse of process". Stevenson was {{of the opinion that}} had he been allowed to, he [...] "could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts". Journalist Rodney Hallworth reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court [...] "I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law. It should be possible for the prosecution to directly examine an accused... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> example of the privilege of silence having enabled a guilty man to escape." [...] In Stevenson's opinion Adams [...] "was so incredibly lucky to have literally got away with murder".|$|E
500|$|The Voyage Home opened theatrically in North America on Thanksgiving weekend, November 26, 1986. Since Star Trek had {{traditionally}} performed poorly internationally, {{the producers}} created a special trailer for foreign markets that de-emphasized the Star Trek {{part of the}} title, as well as retelling the events of The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock. Winter recalled that the marketing {{did not seem to}} make a difference. The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film shown in the Soviet Union, screened by the World Wildlife Fund on June 26, 1987, in Moscow to celebrate a ban on whaling. Attending the screening with Nimoy, Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences; he said [...] "the single most rewarding moment of my Star Trek life" [...] was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy's line, [...] "The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe. We'll get a freighter." [...] Bennett believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> [...] "messenger of what was to come".|$|E

2500|$|On 24 July 2011, Stokes {{scored in}} Celtic's first match of the 2011–12 season, a 2–0 win over Hibernian. On 15 October, Stokes scored twice in six minutes to help Celtic get a 3–3 draw against Kilmarnock. Celtic had been 3–0 down at half-time and Stokes' two goals, one a {{long-range}} shot and one a free-kick, were vital in bringing {{them back into}} he game. Manager Neil Lennon later admitted that if Celtic had lost that match {{he might have had}} to resign. The comeback was also credited by assistant Johan Mjällby as being the turning point in Celtic's season as they went from being 15 point behind Rangers to winning the league. On 3 November, Stokes scored a brace in Celtic's 3–1 win over Stade Rennes in the group stages of the Europa League. He then scored, and got an assist, in Celtic's next game, a 2–1 win over Motherwell. On 9 January, he scored a hat-trick in Celtic's 3–0 win over Third Division side Peterhead in the Fourth round of the League Cup. Before the League Cup final, Stokes said how he felt he was unlikely to start the match. Despite having a very good scoring record with 20 goals for the season, Stokes did not start and came on as a substitute with Celtic trailing 1–0. He went down in the box after a challenge late in the match. However, referee Willie Collum booked him for diving. After the match both Lennon and captain Scott Brown were critical of the referee, saying that decision cost Celtic the trophy and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> penalty. After Celtic's 2–1 defeat to Hearts in the 2011–12 Scottish Cup semi-final, Stokes was given a one-match ban for the competition following an [...] "A5" [...] incident {{at the end of the}} match. This was [...] "offensive, insulting and/or abusive language and/or gestures. On 3 May, Stokes scored the only goal as Celtic beat St Johnstone 1–0.|$|E
