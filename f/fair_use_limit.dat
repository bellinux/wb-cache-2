Peer-to-peer networking involves data transfer from one user to another without using an intermediate server.

Two major cases are Grokster vs RIAA and MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.. In both of the cases the file sharing technology was ruled to be legal as long as the developers had no ability to prevent the sharing of the copyrighted material.

40|$|The Regents Guide to Copyright and Educational <b>Fair</b> <b>Use,</b> {{adopted by}} the Regents of the University System of Georgia, is the most {{comprehensive}} statement on copyright and educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> ever adopted by a major university system. The purpose of this comment {{is to provide a}} brief background for readers and users of the document. The Regents Copyright Committee, appointed by Dr. James Muyskens, Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, University System of Georgia, continues in existence and has eight members, who represent a cross-section of the university community, and include administrators (two of whom are lawyers), faculty (two of whom are lawyers), and librarians. The Chair is Dr. William Gray Potter, University Librarian at the University of Georgia. All members of the Committee have had first hand experience with problems applying the educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> doctrine. In preparing the Guide, the Committee operated as a committee of the whole and all members share the responsibility and deserve the credit [...] or blame, {{as the case may be}} [...] for the final product. All positions in the Guide were discussed, debated, and approved by the members, in all cases by a majority, and in most instances by consensus. All members of the committee participated, in varying degrees, in the drafting (and redrafting) process. A study of copyright law made apparent major differences about the proper interpretation of the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> section of the copyright statute, 17 U. S. C. § 107 (1994). Copyright notices, for example, commonly provide that no one may copy any portion of the book without the written consent of the publisher. Section 107, however, says that “the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies [...] . is not an infringement of copyright. ” More important, for purposes of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> the section lists use for “teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research” as exemplars of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> Given this disparity between the provisions of the statute and the language of many copyright notices, the Committee had no choice but to reason its way through the logic of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> in light of the copyright clause of the U. S. Constitution, the copyright statute, and U. S. Supreme Court decisions. Although there is little identification of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> as such in the cases or literature, Congress gave an unusual amount of attention to it. Thus, four provisions of the Copyright Act are directed to educational fair use: - teaching, research, and scholarship as exemplars of <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> § 107; - a non-profit educational purpose as one of the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> factors, § 107 (1); - the subordination of the limitations on library photocopying to the right of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> § 108 (f) (4); and - the limitation of the liability of employees of non-profit educational institutions and their employees for good faith use, even though the use turns out to be infringing, § 504. These statutory provisions indicate the importance Congress attached to educational <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> and this manifestation of congressional concern was a factor in the consideration of the “Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-For-Profit Educational Institutions. ” Contained in the House Report on the 1976 Copyright Act, pages 68 - 70, the Agreement on Guidelines has been widely cited by publishers as having the effect of replacing the right of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> under section 107. This view of the Agreement, however, is inconsistent with Congress 2 ̆ 7 special treatment of educational use as well as the language in the introduction to the Agreement. That language clearly says that “the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107. ” In addition to this language, there is the fact that Congress did not enact the Agreement on Classroom Guidelines, and whatever its legal status, it seems clear that an agreement between private parties cannot override the copyright statute that Congress did enact. The Agreement on Classroom Guidelines, then, did not prove to be very useful in seeking to provide a balanced guide to educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> for members of the educational community. There are two <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> cases often cited as limiting the right of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> These cases, however, do not support this proposition. Upon analyzing them, a reader will find that the courts rendering them did not rule on educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> at all. The defendants in the cases were not professors or students, but commercial copyshops, and the holdings were that a commercial copyshop in making the copies [...] even at the request of a professor [...] makes a commercial use of the works copied and is not entitled to the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> defense. By <b>limiting</b> their holding to commercial use, the courts avoided the issue of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> that is, whether a professor or student could make copies of excerpts for teaching and learning. A basic issue facing anyone concerned with the advancement of knowledge is whether the right of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> is congruent with the constitutional policies of copyright and consistent with decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court. The copyright clause of the U. S. Constitution is a limitation on, as well as a grant of, Congressional power and manifests the limitation in three policies: 1) the promotion of learning, because it so states; 2) the protection of the public domain, because copyright is available only for original works only for a limited time; and 3) public access to copyrighted materials, because the constitutional purpose of copyright is to promote learning. And since educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> is in the public interest, the Regent 2 ̆ 7 s Guide is consistent with the rulings of the U. S. Supreme Court that copyright is primarily to benefit the public and only secondarily to benefit the author (or copyright owner). My own view is that the Committee followed reason to its logical conclusion and provided a balanced view of educational <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> that will serve the cause of learning without disserving copyright owners. My observation of the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s deliberations convinced me that the members remained fully cognizant throughout its deliberations of the legitimacy of the economic concern of publishers, but also of the constitutional and statutory limitations on the copyright monopoly and of its responsibility to provide a guide for members of the University System community that is within the law. My impression was that the Committee members were concerned with what the law is, not what they might wish it to be. Above all, they seemed to want to avoid the fallacy that occurs when the wish becomes father to the thought. Any disinterested reader who studies the Guide and examines the authorities relied upon will, I think, agree that teachers and students may safely rely upon it as a guide to the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> of copyrighted materials for the classroom...|$|R

40|$|The {{copyright}} <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> caselaw is more {{coherent and}} more predictable than many commentators seem to believe. <b>Fair</b> <b>use</b> cases tend {{to fall into}} common patterns, or what this Article calls policy-relevant clusters. The policies underlying modern <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> law include promoting {{freedom of speech and}} of expression, the ongoing progress of authorship, learning, access to information, truth telling or truth seeking, competition, technological innovation, and the privacy and autonomy interests of users. If one analyzes putative <b>fair</b> <b>uses</b> in light of cases previously decided in the same policy cluster, it is generally possible to predict whether a use is likely to be fair or unfair. Policy-relevant clustering is not a substitute for appropriate consideration of the statutory <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> factors, but it provides another dimension to <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> analysis that complements the four-factor analysis and sharpens awareness about how the statutory factors, sometimes supplemented by other factors, should be analyzed in particular contexts. Parts I through V mainly provide a positive account of how <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> has been adjudicated in a variety of contexts and suggestions about factors that should be given greater or lesser weight in certain <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> policy clusters. Its articulation of the policy-relevant clusters into which the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> cases typically fall should not, however, be understood as attempting to limn the outer bounds of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> or to foreclose the development of new policy-relevant clusters.

However, in order for a use to constitute a <b>fair</b> dealing, the <b>use</b> must first fall within the scope of certain enumerated purposes. Accordingly, fair dealing is more restrictive than <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> less able to adapt to new technologies and is more likely to <b>limit</b> <b>uses</b> of copyrighted works that do not harm copyright owner’s markets. In response to rapid advances in digital technology a number of fair dealing jurisdictions have recently expanded their copyright exceptions with some, such as Australia and Ireland, recommending the adoption of <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> The advantages of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> are numerous and extensive.

First, copyright necessarily must balance intellectual property incentives with the protection of free speech and innovation; <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> constitutes that balancing mechanism. By establishing the outer <b>limits</b> of copyright, <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> in fact enables an expansive interpretation of author 2 ̆ 7 s rights within those bounds. Second, because copyright works best by providing flexible principles that can accommodate technological changes, <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> also constitutes the mechanism by which Congress has given the courts a large policy making role to ensure copyright 2 ̆ 7 s balance. This article explains this structural function of <b>fair</b> <b>use,</b> then shows how this theory should and does apply. In doing so, it also identifies two broad trends emerging in the case law that have previously not been recognized or articulated, despite their significance. These are the principles of consumer autonomy and medium neutrality...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>use</b> is not working. As {{written by}} Congress and applied by the courts, the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> law fails to give {{individuals}} sufficiently clear guidance to determine in advance whether their uses of copyrighted works are fair and therefore noninfringing. When {{the law does}} not regulate adequately, markets can supply the rules. Thus, copyright owners and prospective users of copyrighted works can-and donegotiate over and enter into contracts specifying permissible <b>uses.</b> However, leaving <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> to the market is far from desirable. <b>Fair</b> <b>use</b> is not meant to be something that is sold and bought like other market goods. <b>Fair</b> <b>use</b> is free use. Nobody is meant to be paying for the privilege of using a copyrighted work in a manner that the law deems not to infringe the copyright in the work. Moreover, the <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> market is not a fair market. The failure of Congress and of the courts to provide clear guidance on the meaning of <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> permits copyright owners to leverage the vagueness of the law and persuade prospective users that virtually any unauthorized use constitutes copyright infringement-and that if the use is not paid for it will result in a lawsuit and substantial damages. This Article offers a new approach to <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> It proposes a role for the one branch of the federal government that has so far been left out of the picture: the executive branch. In most areas of the law where clear legal directives are needed to guide behavior in particular contexts and where Congress and the courts are unable to supply the clarity, we turn to administrative agencies. An administrative agency can, and should, regulate <b>fair</b> <b>use.</b> Accordingly, the Article offers two possible models of agency regulation. In the first model, an agency is responsible for generating regulations that determine what constitutes <b>fair</b> <b>use</b> in specific contexts as well as preventing efforts to interfere with <b>fair</b> <b>uses</b> of copyrighted works.
