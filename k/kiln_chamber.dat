5000|$|Camulodunum was a centre for pottery production, peaking {{at around}} 200, and over 40 kilns {{have been in}} the town, {{including}} those found in the northern suburbs of the colonia around Middleborough and a large group at Warren Fields and Oak Drive on the southern outskirts of the Sheepen site. Many of the kilns are of the oval [...] "Colchester type", whilst tile kilns have larger rectangular chambers. Camulodunum produced many types of pottery, including decorated Samian pottery, mortaria, buff wares, single-handled ring-necked flagons, and, until c. 250, colour-coated wares. In the late 1st century amphorae, called [...] "Camulodunum Carrots" [...] for their shape and colour, were made in the colonia, and are found in thin numbers across Britain. The Samian industry, copying the East Gaullish style, was active for a time in Camulodunum from 160 to about 200, with the names of several individual Samian potters identified as working in the colonia. Over 400 fragments of Samian moulds for producing the decorated pottery have been uncovered in the town, [...] including 37 complete examples. A well-preserved Samian kiln was excavated by archaeologist M.R. Hull near Middleborough, just outside North Gate. It was 8 ft wide, with a 5m flue under a large circular <b>kiln</b> <b>chamber,</b> and had a complex system of ceramic pipes and tubes for regulating the oxidisation of the pottery to produce its distinctive red colour. Several of the potters operating in Camulodunum in the First, Second and Third centuries are identified as immigrants from the Rhine Valley and East Gaul, including the Samian potter Minuso from Trier who also operated in other British towns, Miccio, the mortaria potter G.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot <b>kiln.</b> The conditioning <b>chamber</b> opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|R

Most of the workers at the facility were German; judging by the surnames, there may have also been some Czech workers, but very few ethnic Slovenes. The glassworks ceased operations in 1855 or 1856, and a steam-powered sawmill was established at the site in 1870 or 1871. This was the first steam-powered sawmill in Gottschee.

50|$|In 1820 Richard Greaves {{started a}} lime kiln using Blue Lias from a quarry {{just north of}} the village. Completion of the railway in 1852 made it easier for the works to obtain coal and {{distribute}} its lime and cement. The business became Greaves, Bull and Lakin and in 1855 opened a new cement works. By 1882 it had four bottle kilns and was making 120 tons of Portland cement a week. The Great Western revised the railway junction to the works in 1883 and had a signal box built for it in 1899. By 1907 there were 18 <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> making 600 tons a week, and more railway track was laid including a second connection to the works.

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of climbing kilns is that {{heat from the}} burning fuel is re-used, the same heat heating more than {{one part of the}} kiln. Exhaust heat created during firing of {{the lower part of the}} <b>kiln,</b> preheats the <b>chambers</b> above. In addition, the cooling ware and walls below preheat the incoming air. Thus, firing of ware in the upper chambers requires only the additional fuel needed to bring the ware, walls and air to peak temperature. (From a thermodynamic point of view, the higher temperature of combustion and cooler exhaust suggest greater efficiency.) A modern type, called a tube kiln improves the efficiency and output still further by having the ware move through the kiln in a direction opposite to that of the hot gasses.|$|R

From 1888 <b>chamber</b> <b>kilns</b> were installed, with 28 in total by 1898 with a total capacity of 980t per week. The first two Rotary kilns were installed in 1906, adding a capacity of 860t per week.

Early kilns were rising tunnels, not divided into chambers, but with a step at intervals giving relatively flat floor levels, and perhaps using gravel or similar material {{on the floor to}} allow vertical stacks to be rested. From the Southern Song period (1127-1279), some kilns were built as a series of chambers, stepped as they ran up the slope, and with connecting doors to allow access to both the kiln-workers during loading and unloading, and the heat during firing. There might be up to 12 <b>chambers.</b> <b>Chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were usual for making Longquan celadon.|$|R

40|$|Wood as {{a natural}} {{resource}} material can be modified by applying different drying techniques {{in order to have}} end products with improved properties. In wood drying industries, each parameter that has effect on end product quality and cost is elaborated intensively. In this context, stickers which are used to enable heat and moist air circulate through timber layers that are put in kilns for drying process are in concern, too. It {{is due to the fact}} that stickers are one of the major cost parameters in wood drying industries: not only the cost issue, but stickers also have direct effect on heat treatment process generated in <b>kiln</b> <b>chambers,</b> the total volume of timber that can be put in kilns and end product quality. This thesis makes both an evaluation and comparison for wood and aluminum sticker types which were used in heat treatment of Norway spruce boards by ThermoWood process. It was in interest to use wood and aluminum stickers in one single wood stack and make investigations on them broadly. Therefore, the evaluation of stickers and sticker stains was conducted in four different dimensions which were referred as chemical, physical, statistical (multivariate analysis approach) and economical research aspects. In chemical aspect, formation of the sticker stains was tried to be understood by literature reviews and a simple acidity test was made on sticker stained zones of sample boards. It was inferred that the sticker stain formation was generated due to a combination of both physical and chemical phenomenon which take place during drying. In the acidity test, the pH values of sticker underneath zones were lower (more acidic) than the sticker adjacent zones. However, the differences between pH values were not significant and both zones had pH values around 4 units. In physical aspect, color measurements were made on sample boards in subsequently increasing planing depths in order to investigate the severity degree of sticker stains on heat treated wood surface. These color measurements were made in L* C* h color space and the sticker stains’ severity degrees were successfully quantified by E*ab color difference values. The sufficient planing depth required to have a uniform looking heat treated surface without sticker stains was determined 1 - 2 mms. The other issues which might affect the sticker stain severity degree and planing process were discussed. In the statistical aspect, the data obtained from color measurements were used to make a multivariate analysis to investigate the variables which were influencing sticker stains and the relations between them. It was found that planing was the most influential factor on color variables. In the economical aspect, cost estimation and comparison were made for wood and aluminum stickers for short and long term utilization periods. The results indicated that aluminum stickers were costing less than wood stickers in long term utilization periods. However, it was also found out that the handling issues of stickers (installation-sticker removing and conveying systems) in sawmill operations was in great importance for a facility to make a decision for using a certain sticker type.

50|$|The kilns allowed large {{quantities}} of pottery to be fired at high temperatures, but the firing was not usually even across {{the length of the}} kiln, which often produced different effects on pieces at different levels. Very often the higher chambers produced the better pieces, as they heated up more slowly. As one example, the wide range of colours seen in Chinese celadon wares such as Yue ware and Longquan celadon is largely explained by variations in firing conditions. Variations in the shades of white porcelains between and within the northern Ding ware and the southern Qingbai were also the result of the fuel used. Some of the most advanced <b>chambered</b> <b>kilns</b> were built to fire Dehua porcelain, where precise control of high temperatures was essential.

40|$|Incineration {{is not a}} new {{technology}} and has been used to destroy organic hazardous waste for many years. Nevertheless, variability in waste composition and the severity of the incineration operating conditions may result in many practical operating problems, high maintenance requirements and equipment unreliability. Moreover, a large number of constraints must be satisfied. These constraints are imposed by permit, by design and by operating practice. The goal of this work is to present a dynamic model which is able to follow large variations in process conditions and to be of practical value from a control point of view. This paper deals in particular with the development of a dynamic model which describes the behavior of a rotary <b>kiln</b> (primary combustion <b>chamber</b> with heterogeneous combustion) as well as the corresponding afterburner system (secondary combustion chamber with homogeneous combustion) followed by a heat recovery system which completes the hot section of a typical incineration plant.

Petrographic analysis under optical microscopy and mineralogical characterization by X-ray powder diffraction were carried out in order to identify homogenous groups, to define the provenance of the raw materials and possible importation cases by comparison with the natural resources available in the region, as well as to constrain the production technology, with particular reference to the paste preparation and the firing process. Five main petrographic groups were defined, the features of which showed strong compatibility with clayey and silty-clayey alluvial deposits of Mondragone territory, suggesting a local production of the studied pottery. Mineral assemblages constrained the firing temperature in the interval 750 - 950 °C, at variable redox conditions defined {{on the basis of the}} paste colour, suggesting the use of pit firing or <b>kilns</b> with firing <b>chamber</b> directly in contact with the firebox.

40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a rotary kiln with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the rotary kiln is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the rotary kiln, in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (rotary kiln – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the rotary kiln on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the rotary kiln, in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the rotary kiln. In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric acids, tar acids and high-heat-value waste materials in the rotary kiln. The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the rotary kiln, where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the rotary kiln and thus feed the coke bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the rotary kiln is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the rotary kiln are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the rotary kiln. One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the rotary kiln and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as tar acids can impair the energy balance in the rotary kiln and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising rotary <b>kiln,</b> post-combustion <b>chamber</b> and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|R
