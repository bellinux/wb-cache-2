5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this <b>growth,</b> <b>on</b> 9 April 2006 the OCC began to include {{download}} sales alongside physical sales when compiling the UK Albums Chart. That same day, the OCC also launched a dedicated weekly chart based solely on sales of album downloads in the UK. Approximately 64,000 albums were downloaded during the week of the chart's launch, of which just under 2,000 were of This New Day by the British band Embrace, the chart's first number one. By the end of 2006 nearly 2.8million album downloads had been purchased, which comprised 1.8% of the total album sales. The following year the UK's online music revenue grew to , which made the nation Europe's largest consumer of online music. By the end of decade over 25million albums had been downloaded and the market comprised 12.5% of total album sales. Following Embrace, a further 99 artists topped the chart; fifteen did so with two albums. Including original soundtracks and compilations, a total of 121 albums reached number one during the 2000s. , the UK Album Download Chart continues to be published each week by the OCC.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E

5|$|SASO decided after {{a debate}} to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Three African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E

5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of future <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E
5|$|Three African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} {{take part in}} a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of the rainy season, they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water. When the rainy season begins again a few months later, the animals trek back to their wet-season range. These movements and access to nutrient rich forage for reproduction allow migratory wildebeest populations to grow to much larger numbers than resident populations. There were many long-distance migratory populations of wildebeest 100 years ago, but currently all but three migrations (Serengeti, Tarangire, and Kafue) have been disrupted, cut off, and lost.|$|E
5|$|Wind also limits tree <b>growth.</b> <b>On</b> coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E

5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E

25|$|Quandt {{and colleagues}} later {{published}} findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit+ evolution. This mutation {{was in the}} gltA gene, which encodes citrate synthase, an enzyme involved {{in the flow of}} carbon into the citric acid cycle. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> acetate. Moreover, with the gltA mutation, the rnk-citT module that causes the Cit+ trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The gltA mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit++ phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in gltA countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in gltA first potentiated, and then refined <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit+ arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on <b>growth</b> <b>on</b> acetate, and that the potentiating mutations that led to evolution of Cit+ in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use.|$|E
