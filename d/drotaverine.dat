40|$|<b>Drotaverine</b> is {{considered}} as an inhibitor of cyclic- 3 ′, 5 ′-nucleotide-phophodiesterase (PDE) enzymes. However, published receptor binding data supports the potential Ltype Voltage Operated Calcium Channel (L-VOCC) blocking effect of <b>drotaverine</b> too. Hence, {{in this work}} we are focusing on the potential L-VOCC blocking effect of <b>drotaverine</b> using L-VOCC associated functional in vitro models. Accordingly, <b>drotaverine</b> and reference agents were tested on KCl-induced guinea pig tracheal contraction. It was found that <b>drotaverine,</b> like the L-VOCC blockers nifedipine or diltiazem, inhibited the KCl-induced inward Ca 2 +- induced contraction in a concentration dependent fashion. The PDE-inhibitor theophylline {{had no effect on}} the KCl-evoked contractions indicating its lack of inhibition on inward Ca 2 + flow. <b>Drotaverine</b> was also tested on the L-VOCC mediated resting Ca 2 + refill model. In this model the extracellular Ca 2 + enters the cells to replenish the emptied intracellular Ca 2 + stores. <b>Drotaverine</b> and L-VOCC blocker reference molecules inhibited the Ca 2 + replenishment of Ca 2 + depleted preparations detected by agonist-induced contractions in post Ca 2 + replenishment Ca 2 + free medium. Theophylline didn’t modify the Ca 2 + store replenishment following contraction. It seems that <b>drotaverine</b> but not theophylline inhibit the inward Ca 2 + flux. Addition of CaCl 2 to Ca 2 + free medium containing the agonist, induced inward Ca 2 + flow and subsequent contraction of Ca 2 + depleted tracheal preparations. <b>Drotaverine</b> similar to the L-VOCC blockers, inhibited inward Ca 2 + flow and blunted the slope of CaCl 2 -induced contraction in agonist containing Ca 2 + free medium withCa 2 + depleted tracheal preparations. These results show that <b>drotaverine</b> behaves like L-VOCC blockers but unlike PDE inhibitors using L-VOCC associated in vitro experimental models...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} done to compare the {{effectiveness}} of <b>drotaverine</b> hydrochloride and valethamate bromide in shortening duration of labour. Methods: It is a hospital based prospective study, {{carried out in the}} department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital (KMCTH), Sinamangal from 1 st June to 31 st August 2005. 99 patients, who were in active labour, were taken into the study. Out of which 50 were in <b>drotaverine</b> group (Group 1) who had received 40 mg of <b>drotaverine</b> hydrochloride intramuscularly at 3 to 5 cm dilatation of the cervix.

40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} {{poisoning}} in Russia {{may be different}} from other countries. The study objective was to describe the pattern of poisoning with cardiovascular drugs in a major industrial city in Russia, Yekaterinburg. Methods: This study {{was part of a}} larger prospective multi-center study including all acute poisonings in patients older than 15 years of age in the city of Yekaterinburg, during March 2009 to March 2010. Patients with main diagnosis of acute poisoning by cardiovascular drugs and two other commonly used drugs affecting cardiac system were included. Results: Cardiovascular drugs were the main poisoning agent in 269 cases of 3, 112 acute poisonings (8. 6 %) during the study period. Median age of the patients was 36 (range: 16 - 88) years and 108 patients (40 %) were men. Over 85 % of patients required hospital admission and ICU care was needed for 45. 7 % of patients. Men significantly outnumbered women in veratrine poisoning (P < 0. 001) while women significantly outnumbered men in clonidine (P < 0. 001), <b>drotaverine</b> (P < 0. 001), CCB (P < 0. 001) and beta blocker (P = 0. 012) poisoning. The most frequent complications were hypotension (83 patients; 30. 8 %), cardiac arrhythmias (22 patients; 8. 2 %) and QT prolongation (5 patients; 1. 9 %). The main agents significantly associated with hypotension were the phenylalkylamine and benzothiazepine subclasses of CCBs (verapamil/diltiazem), veratrine, beta blockers, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, clonidine, and adelphan. In total, mortality rate was 4. 1 %. The highest rate of death was recorded for poisoning with verapamil/diltiazem (20 %) followed by dihydropyridine subclass of CCBs (9. 1 %).    Conclusion: The most common drugs causing hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias were clonidine, CCBs, <b>drotaverine</b> and the veterinary drug “veratrine”. <b>Drotaverine,</b> clonidine and CCBs were the most common drugs causing death. Poisonings with these agents are rare in other countries. Measures to reduce the availability of <b>drotaverine</b> and veratrine should be taken in Russia...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND With {{regard to}} normal labour, many eminent obstetricians have aptly remarked {{that of all}} the {{journeys}} the most dangerous is the very first one we make through the last ten centimetres of the birth canal. Hence, it is imperative that this short but crucial process is made safest for the baby. The role of a good obstetrician is to convert an abnormal situation where the events are not happening to one in which order is regained. Methods that aim at minimizing the incidence of functional cervical dystocia and cutting short the 1 st stage of labour are always accepted by the obstetricians and patients. OBJECTIVES To compare the effect of Inj. Buscopan IV and Inj. <b>Drotaverine</b> & to find out which of the above drugs is more effective in shortening the labour. METHODOLOGY This study was undertaken at Sree Mookambika Institute of Medical Sciences from June 2015 to December 2015. The sample size was calculated using the formula sample size n= 2 Z 1 2 S 2 /d 2., sample size required is 29. We have taken 50 sample sizes per group. This is a cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria was primigravidae with full term gestation with vertex presentation in active labour. RESULTS The mean duration of 1 st stage (active phase) of labour in group D was 118. 04 mins., that of group H 129. 74 mins. and of group C 185. 38 mins. The mean duration of 2 nd stage of labour in group D was 23. 20 mins., that of group H 25. 38 mins. and of group C 23. 97 mins. The mean duration of 3 rd stage of labour in group D was 11. 44 mins., that of group H 14. 02 mins. and of group C 15. 16 mins. Rate of cervical dilatation is significantly more in Group D when compared to Group C (3. 147 mins. vs. 1. 97 mins.) (p< 0. 001). The rate of cervical dilatation is significantly more in Group H when compared to Group C (2. 78 mins. vs. 1. 97 mins.) (p< 0. 001). Rate of cervical dilatation was also significantly more in Group D when compared to Group H (3. 147 mins. vs. 2. 78 mins.) (p< 0. 001). Frequency of usage of higher number of doses is significantly more in Group D compared to Group H with p< 0. 001.

40|$|Background: Labour is {{a normal}} {{physiological}} process, progress of which depends upon the strength andfrequency of uterine contractions and simultaneous active cervical dilatation. But sometimes activecervical dilatation lags behind {{even though there is}} presence of uterine contraction and causes painabdomen, prolongation of labour which can hamper both maternal and foetal health. Hence comes theneed to use the cervical dilators to encourage the cervical dilatation to compete with the frequent uterinecontractions and facilitates the labour process. Valethamate Bromide (VB) belongs to those groups ofdrugs which {{can be used as a}} cervical dilator in need. Now a day, the use of VB has become very less incomparison with other cervical dilators and reason is not clearly established yet. Aim & Objectives: 1. To compare the safety of VB in comparison to <b>Drotaverine</b> Hydrochloride 2. To compare the efficacy of VB with Hyoscine Butylebromide and 3. To study the actions of Valethamate Bromide upon duration of labour. Methods/Study Design: It was an interventional, hospital based study done in MMC&H, India. Aftertaking necessary permissions for the study, total 450 primi gravida patients without any obstetricalabnormality and contraindications to the drugs were selected randomly for six months. Three equal (150 each) groups were formed to satisfy each objective separately. First two groups were divided into three(50 each) and rest into two (75 each) equal sub-groups. All of the drugs were given intramuscularly onlyin first stage of labour following the prescribed doses. Necessary clinical evaluations were done at aregular interval and collected data were analyzed with SPSS software. Results/Findings: In first group, <b>Drotaverine</b> HCl has proved to be quicker cervical dilator thanValethamate Bromide; but produced cervical lacerations in considerable number of patients (12. 5 %unilateral, 19 % bilateral). In second group, sub-groups were given Valethamate Bromide, HyoscineButylbromide, and distilled water (placebo) respectively. Average rate of cervical dilatations were(2. 05 ± 0. 58) cm/hr, (1. 79 ± 0. 64) cm/hr and (1. 12 ± 0. 14) cm/hr & Average duration of labour was 5 hours, 6. 7 hours and 9. 5 hours respectively. In remaining study group Valethamate Bromide significantlyreduced both the first stage (p< 0. 01) and second stage (p< 0. 01) of labour in respect to the group gotplacebo. Study Limitations: It was single handed study done on small population and many clinical correlationswere overlooked to focus the aims only. Conclusion: Leaving the contraindications in normal pregnancy with no abnormal obstetric problems theValethamate Bromide can be used to achieve safe, accelerated delivery with least complication...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a dissolution test method for tablets containing 80 mg of <b>drotaverine</b> hydrochloride (DRT) and 250 mg of mefenamic acid (MEF). Methods: Sink conditions, drug stability and specificity in different dissolution media were tested to optimize a dissolution test method using a USP paddle type dissolution test apparatus {{set at a}} speed of 50 rpm. The dissolution medium consisted of 900 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) containing 0. 25 % w/v cetrimide at 37 ± 0. 5 oC and 45 min time-point. To determine both drugs simultaneously, a first derivative UV spectrophotometric method was developed and validated. Drug release was analyzed by first derivative UV method at 253. 8 nm and 304 nm for DRT and MEF respectively. The dissolution method was validated as per ICH guidelines. Results: The two brands each showed 98 % of drug release for both drugs when the developed dissolution method was used. The regression plot was linear in the concentration range 4 - 24 µg/mL {{for each of the}} drugs and regression coefficient (r 2) was greater than 0. 999 for each drug. Relative standard deviation (% RSD) for precision and accuracy of proposed method was < 2. Conclusion: The proposed dissolution method is simple, cost-effective, precise, accurate and specific...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prolongation {{of labor}} leads to dehydration, ketoacidosis, infection, fetal asphyxia. Programmed labor aims at {{reducing}} {{the duration of}} labor, labor pain and incidence of cesarean section with improved maternal and neonatal outcome. Aims and Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effect of programmed labor on duration of labor. 2) To assess efficacy of analgesics in reducing pain of labor. 3) To find out maternal and neonatal complications. 4) To study impact of programmed labor on LSCS rates. Methods: Prospective randomized study of primigravida in active labor (after 4 cm cervical dilatation) for which 100 women were selected for programmed labor (cases) and 100 women were selected for traditional management of labor (controls). Cases were subjected to interventions to improve uterine contractions (ARM, Dinoprostone tablets, and Oxytocin drip), to facilitate cervical dilatation (Inj. <b>Drotaverine),</b> to relieve labor pains (Inj. Pentazocine & Diazepam). All labors were monitored by partogram. Results: Programmed labor reduced duration of first and second stage of labor. There was faster cervical dilatation (1. 8 cm/hour against 1. 2 cm/hour). Majority of the patients had better pain relief. There was no impact on LSCS rates Conclusions: Programmed labor significantly reduced duration of labor with good pain relief without compromising maternal and fetal/neonatal safety. But it had no impact on LSCS rates. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2013; 2 (2. 000) : 209 - 212...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} early {{achalasia}} presented spontaneous strong rhythmic non-propulsive contractions at ~ 7 /min, independent of swallows. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate characteristics of the rhythmic contractions, provide data {{on the structure of}} pacemaker cells in the esophagus and discuss a potential role for interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the origin of rhythmicity. We hypothesize that intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM) are the primary pacemaker cells. The frequency but not the amplitude of the rhythmic contractions was inhibited by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor <b>drotaverine</b> consistent with cAMP inhibiting pacemaker currents in ICC-IM. The frequency increased by wet swallows but not dry swallows, consistent with stretch causing increase in slow wave frequency in ICC-IM. New studies on archival material showed that ICC-IM were present throughout the human esophageal musculature and were not diminished in early achalasia. Although ICC-IM exhibited a low density, they were connected to PDGFRα-positive fibroblast-like cells with whom they formed a dense gap junction coupled network. Nitrergic innervation of ICC was strongly diminished in early achalasia because of the loss of nitrergic nerves. It therefore appears possibly that ICC-IM function as pacemaker cells in the esophagus and that the network of ICC and PDGFRα-positive cells allows for coupling and propagation of the pacemaker activity. Loss of nitrergic innervation to ICC in achalasia may render them more excitable such that its pacemaker activity is more easily expressed. Loss of propagation in achalasia may be due to loss of contraction-induced aboral nitrergic inhibition...|$|E
