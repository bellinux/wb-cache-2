The highway intersects with Township Road 613, where the highway makes a <b>hairpin</b> turn to the south. The route continues to the southeast into a denser portion of Lebanon Township. The route continues for a distance to the east until an intersection with Lebanon Township Road 614 {{in the community of}} Cold Spring. In Cold Spring, PA371 turns to the southeast through deep forests until an intersection with Township Roads 612 and 617. There, the forests break, and the route continues to the southeast. A short distance later, PA371 intersects with PA191 (Hancock Highway) in the community of Rileyville. There, the route begins to follow the alignment of the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike. PA371 continues through rural farmlands until a <b>hairpin</b> turn in the deep forests nearby.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hairpins</b> (generally {{known as}} [...] ) are an {{important}} symbol in Chinese culture.

40|$|Main-chain liquid {{crystalline}} polymers (LCPs) {{are used}} to produce strong ¿bers due {{to their ability to}} form highly-ordered orientational states. For su¿ciently long chains it is known that loss of entropy in such highly-ordered states is partly recovered by the formation of so-called <b>hairpins</b> or kinks. The presence of <b>hairpins</b> not only modi¿es the microstructure of LCPs, but it has also been conjectured that <b>hairpins</b> in¿uence their macroscopic mechanical behavior. In this paper the in¿uence of <b>hairpins</b> on the rheological properties of concentrated solutions of LCPs is studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{secondary}} structure on DNA duplex formation is poorly understood. Using oxDNA, a nucleotide level coarse-grained model of DNA, we study how <b>hairpins</b> influence the rate and reaction pathways of DNA hybridzation. We compare to experimental systems studied by Gao et al. (1) {{and find that}} 3 -base pair <b>hairpins</b> reduce the hybridization rate {{by a factor of}} 2, and 4 -base pair <b>hairpins</b> by a factor of 10, compared to DNA with limited secondary structure, which is in good agreement with experiments. By contrast, melting rates are accelerated by factors of ∼ 100 and ∼ 2000. This surprisingly large speed-up occurs because <b>hairpins</b> form during the melting process, and significantly lower the free energy barrier for dissociation. These results should assist experimentalists in designing sequences to be used in DNA nanotechnology, by putting limits on the suppression of hybridization reaction rates through the use of <b>hairpins</b> and offering the possibility of deliberately increasing dissociation rates by incorporating <b>hairpins</b> into single strands...|$|R

40|$|Effects of the {{universal}} base 5 -nitroindole on the thermodynamic stability of DNA <b>hairpins</b> having a 6 bp stem and four base loops were investigated by optical absorbance and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Melting studies were conducted in buffer containing 115 mM Na(+). Five different modified versions of DNA <b>hairpins</b> containing a 5 -nitroindole base or bases substituted at different positions in the stem and loop regions were examined. Thermo-dynamic parameters of the melting transitions estimated from a two-state analysis of optical melting curves and measured directly by calorimetry revealed {{that the presence of}} 5 -nitroindole bases in the duplex stem or loop regions of short DNA <b>hairpins</b> significantly affects both their enthalpic and entropic melting components in a compensating manner, while the transition free energy varies linearly with the transition temperature. The calorimetrically determined enthalpy and entropy values of the modified <b>hairpins</b> were considerably smaller (43 - 53 %) than the two-state optical parameters, suggesting that solvent effects may be significant in the melting processes of these <b>hairpins.</b> Results of circular dichroism measurements also revealed slight differences between the modified <b>hairpins</b> and the control in both the duplex and melted states, suggesting subtle structural differences between the control and DNA <b>hairpins</b> containing a 5 -nitroindole base or bases...|$|R

40|$|Nucleic acids can undergo dynamic {{conformational}} changes {{associated with}} the regulation of biological processes. A molecule presenting larger affinities for alternative structures relative to a duplex is expected to modify such conformational equilibria. We have previously reported that macrocyclic bis-acridine binds preferentially to single-stranded regions, especially DNA <b>hairpins,</b> due to steric effects. Here, we show, using gel electrophoresis, fluorescence and melting temperature experiments, that the macrocycle bis-acridine shifts an equilibrium from a duplex towards the corresponding <b>hairpins.</b> Competition experiments enlighten the higher affinity of the macrocycle for <b>hairpins</b> compared with double-stranded DNA. The macrocycle bis-acridine destabilizes a synthetic polynucleotide, by the formation of premelted areas. By extrapolation, the macrocycle bis-acridine {{should be able to}} disrupt, at least locally, genomic DNA duplexes and to stabilize unpaired areas, especially palindromic ones forming <b>hairpins.</b> Such macrocyclic compounds may have potential applications in the therapy of diseases involving <b>hairpins...</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a <b>hairpin</b> turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the <b>hairpin</b> turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E

40|$|By using optical tweezers, we have {{investigated}} the mechanical unfolding of a minimal kissing complex with only two G·C base pairs. The loop–loop interaction is exceptionally stable; it is disrupted at forces ranging from 7 to 30 pN, as compared with 14 – 20 pN for unfolding <b>hairpins</b> of 7 and 11 bp. By monitoring unfolding/folding trajectories of single molecules, we resolved the intermediates, measured their rate constants, and pinpointed the rate-limiting steps. The two <b>hairpins</b> unfold only after breaking the intramolecular kissing interaction, and the kissing interaction forms only after the folding of the <b>hairpins.</b> At forces that favor the unfolding of the <b>hairpins,</b> the entire RNA structure is kinetically stabilized by the kissing interaction, and extra work is required to unfold the metastable <b>hairpins.</b> The strong mechanical stability of even a minimal kissing complex indicates the importance of such loop–loop interactions in initiating and stabilizing RNA dimers in retroviruses...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNA (miRNA) {{precursor}} <b>hairpins</b> have {{a unique}} secondary structure, nucleotide length, and nucleotide content that are in most cases evolutionarily conserved. The {{aim of this study}} was to utilize position-specific features of miRNA <b>hairpins</b> to improve their identification. To this end, we defined the evolutionary and structurally conserved features in each position of miRNA <b>hairpins</b> with heuristically derived values, which were successfully integrated using a probabilistic framework. Our method, miRRim 2, can not only accurately detect miRNA <b>hairpins,</b> but infer the location of a mature miRNA sequence. To evaluate the accuracy of miRRim 2, we designed a cross validation test in which the whole human genome was used for evaluation. miRRim 2 could more accurately detect miRNA <b>hairpins</b> than the other computational predictions that had been performed on the human genome, and detect the position of the 5 '-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) above 0. 4. To further evaluate miRRim 2 on independent data, we applied it to the Ciona intestinalis genome. Our method detected 47 known miRNA <b>hairpins</b> among top 115 candidates, and pinpointed the 5 '-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and PPV about 0. 4. When our results were compared with deep-sequencing reads of small RNA libraries from Ciona intestinalis cells, we found several candidates in which the predicted mature miRNAs were in good accordance with deep-sequencing results...|$|R

Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E

40|$|Tandem repeats {{of certain}} trinucleotides show {{extensive}} intergenerational instability in humans that {{is associated with}} a class of genetic disorders known as the Triplet Expansion Diseases. This instability is thought to be a consequence of the formation of intrastrand structures, including <b>hairpins,</b> triplexes and tetraplexes, by the tandem repeats. I show here that CGG-repeats which are associated with this group of diseases, and AGG- and TGG-repeats which are not currently known to be, form several intrastrand structures including tetraplexes. In all cases the tetraplexes have the same overall conformation in which all the G residues are involved in G 4 -tetrads. CGG-repeats also form stable <b>hairpins,</b> but AGG- and TGG-repeats do not form <b>hairpins</b> of comparable stability. However, since tetraplexes {{can be thought of as}} folded <b>hairpins,</b> many of the properties ascribed to disease-associated triplets that form <b>hairpins,</b> may apply to these sequences as well. The fact that AGG- and TGG-repeats are not currently associated with any triplet expansion disease suggests either that the ability to adopt an intrastrand folded structure is not sufficient for expansion, or that other diseases associated with such triplets might remain to be identified...|$|R
