25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
500|$|Convinced of Boggs' {{involvement}} in the kidnapping, the prison warden rules out any kind of clemency. [...] Boggs is then visited by Scully, who claims there is a deal and to whom he gives information about the kidnapper's new location, warning her to avoid [...] "the blue devil". Scully then leads several agents to the location Boggs gave hera brewerywhere {{they are able to}} rescue the kidnapped boyfriend. Scully chases the kidnapper as he flees, but stops <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> when he runs along a gantry beneath the brewery's logoa leering blue devil. The gantry gives way, and the kidnapper falls to his death. Scully speaks to Boggs again, to whom she tells that if he had orchestrated the kidnapping, the kidnapper would have been aware of the danger he warned her about, hence refraining from crossing that gantry [...] and that he saved her life as well as the boy's life. He then claims to be able to contact her father and offers to relay one last message to her from him if she will attend his execution.|$|E

500|$|The Russians {{were spotted}} {{early on the}} morning of 27 May by Japanese ships as they entered the Korea Strait en route to Vladivostok. During the {{subsequent}} battle Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron and was initially the target of at least two battleships and a pair of armored cruisers when the Japanese opened fire at 14:10. As the Japanese approached, Rozhestvensky ordered the fleet to move from line ahead formation to parallel columns and Oslyabya was forced to almost stop <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> to avoid hitting the battleship , the last ship of Rozhestvensky's division, as she maneuvered. Almost immediately, the shells began inflicting damage, knocking out the rangefinder, wounding the gunnery officer and severing the cables connecting the guns to the Geisler fire-control system. Other hits shot away the mainmast and knocked out the forward gun turret as well as three of the port six-inch guns. Splinters from one of the many hits entered her conning tower, killing the quartermaster and wounding most of the men inside. This caused the ship to fall out of line to starboard and she was engaged by six Japanese armored cruisers at short range. More serious were several large-caliber shells that struck along the ship's waterline about 15 minutes into the engagement that caused major flooding; they opened up enough of the ship's bow to the sea that her forward motion forced more and more water into her hull and she began listing to port. Flooding of her starboard forward magazine was ordered in an attempt to counteract the list, but it just added more weight forward and destroyed the ship's stability. Oslyabyas list increased to 12 degrees at 14:20, flooding many of the lower turrets. Her funnels touched the water around 15:10 and Ber ordered [...] "abandon ship". The ship sank a few minutes later, with her starboard propeller still turning, taking Ber and 470 of her crew with her.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} mid-January that Hedwig {{appeared}} to investigate the loss of Kingani, which was assumed to have strayed within range of the shore batteries and been sunk. Hedwig returned on 8 February, having failed to learn anything significant on her first pass, {{and this time the}} British were ready. Spicer-Simson had taken command of Fifi, and supported by Mimi and two Belgian vessels, took his flotilla in pursuit. Odebrecht spotted the approaching vessels, but continued to advance. Initially mistaking them for Belgian craft, the white ensigns revealed that they were British. He continued towards the shore until making a sharp turn to port at 9.30am, either attempting to lure them toward Götzen, or having been fooled by an optical illusion into thinking the approaching vessels were larger than he had first thought. The pursuing vessels chased Hedwig, with Fifi opening fire with her bow mounted 12-pounder. The recoil stopped her dead <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks,</b> Odebrecht used this to pull away. Hedwig could do [...] to Fifis , but as Fifi fell behind, Mimi sped past, firing on the retreating German vessel with her 3-pounder gun. [...] The shots missed, but Hedwigs stern guns did not have the range of Mimis weapon, and Odebrecht was forced to come about and try to hit her with his bow-mounted 6-pounder. The two circled for a time, unable to score hits, until Fifi closed. Spicer-Simson, commanding aboard Fifi, was down to three shells on his 12-pounder, and risked being outclassed if Hedwig could bring her own 6-pounder to bear. At this moment, the shell jammed in Fifis gun, and in the twenty minutes that it took to clear it, Hedwig again pulled away, searching for Götzen. With her second to last shot, Fifi fired again. The shell hit Hedwigs hull, causing flooding, while moments later her last shell hit the engine room, bursting the boiler and killing five African sailors and two Germans. As fires began to spread through the stricken craft Odebrecht gave the order to abandon ship, and set explosive charges to destroy the sinking vessel. [...] The British picked up the survivors, and also captured a large German naval ensign, the first to be taken in the war.|$|E
60|$|It was {{equivalent}} to condemning them to hell! No Missouri Negro doubted this.

60|$|The {{trees were}} dripping, the willows heavy with water, and the mud ankle-deep--in places--but she pushed on steadily, and he, {{following}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks,</b> could only marvel at her strength and sturdy self-reliance.

60|$|Meriem {{stopped short}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{listening}} again, and sniffing--more than ever the tigress; alert, ready.

He rose quietly and following the shadows of the bushes that ran down to the corral was soon gone from sight.|$|E
60|$|Flo's cry showed {{she must}} nearly be strangled with terror. But Carley was frozen <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> Her eyes were riveted upon the gray furry object. It stopped.

60|$|At {{this point}} the maid, who disliked Muriel, stopped and made a noise like an {{exploding}} pop bottle, {{at the same time}} taking a little run in Muriel's direction and kicking at her with a menacing foot.

60|$|By and by Granny Fox {{came to a}} hole in the ground, an {{old house}} that had once belonged to her grandfather. Now this old house had a back door hidden close beside the hollow trunk of a fallen tree. Old Granny Fox just ran through the house, out the back door, through the hollow tree, and then jumped into a little brook where there was hardly more than enough water to wet her feet. Walking in the water, she left no scent <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last Roy {{led into}} a ravine so deep and wide {{and full of}} forest verdure that it {{appeared}} impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started down, dismounting after a little way.

Twice he stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and threw her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to run for her life.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no other}} word spoken. Soon the dawn, moving across the great waste of waters, pierced the dark {{background}} behind the steamer's light.

The dim shape of her sails stole slowly into sight, and they {{could see that she}} was carrying a great weight of canvas.

6000|$|Josefa was {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks,</b> quietly reloading her silver- mounted [...] .38. It {{had not been}} a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging {{at the end of a}} string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.|$|E
6000|$|Closer {{and closer}} to the fringe of willows along the river she came, until, at their very edge, there broke upon her already taut nerves the hideous and uncanny scream of a wildcat. The girl stopped short <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> She felt the chill of fear creep through her skin, and a {{twitching}} at the roots of her hair evidenced to her the extremity of her terror. Should she turn back? The horses might be between her and the river, but judgment told her that they had crossed. Should she brave the nervous fright of a passage through that dark, forbidding labyrinth of gloom when she knew that she should not find the horses within reach beyond? ...|$|E
60|$|And that {{is another}} reason why the fawns must learn to obey a wiser head than their own. Till their little feet are educated, the mother must choose the way for them; and a wise fawn will jump {{squarely}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> That explains also why deer, even after they are full grown, will often walk in single file, a half-dozen of them sometimes following a wise leader, stepping in his tracks and leaving but a single trail. It is partly, perhaps, to fool their old enemy, the wolf, and their new enemy, the man, by hiding the weakling's trail in the stride and hoof mark of a big buck; but it shows also the old habit, and the training which begins when the fawns first learn to follow the flag.|$|E

60|$|Jones {{could not}} let well enough alone; he {{acknowledged}} this even as he swore he must have five. Emboldened by his marvelous luck, and yielding headlong to the passion within, he threw caution to the winds. A lame old cow with a red calf caught his eye; in he spurred his willing horse and slung his rope. It stung the haunch of the mother. The mad grunt she vented was no quicker than the velocity with which she plunged and reared. Jones had but time to swing his leg over the saddle when the hoofs beat down. Kentuck rolled on the plain, flinging his rider from him. The infuriated buffalo lowered her head for the fatal charge on the horse, when the plainsman, jerking out his heavy Colts, shot her dead <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E

There I waited for many hours, when suddenly I perceived a dark figure coming secretly towards me. It was the figure of a woman, and in her hand she held a dagger. Behind that figure crept another unseen by the woman. It was Bougwan following <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> His shoes were off, and for so fat a man he followed very well.

60|$|The {{sight of}} that great red ship with her gilt beak-head and open ports {{swinging}} broadside on must have given check to Rivarol's soaring exultation. Yet {{before he could}} move to give an order, before he could well resolve what order to give, a volcano of fire and metal burst upon him from the buccaneers, and his decks were swept by the murderous scythe of the broadside. The Arabella held to her course, giving place to the Elizabeth, which, following closely, executed the same manoeuver. And then whilst still the Frenchmen were confused, panic-stricken by an attack that took them so utterly by surprise, the Arabella had gone about, and was returning <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>tracks,</b> presenting now her larboard guns, and loosing her second broadside {{in the wake of}} the first.
