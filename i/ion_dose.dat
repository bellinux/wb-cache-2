5000|$|Ballistic {{ion beam}} mixing can be {{classified}} into two basic subtypes, recoil mixing and cascade mixing, which take place simultaneously {{as a result of}} ion bombardment. In recoil mixing, atoms are relocated by single collision events. Recoil mixing is predominately seen at large angles as a result of soft collisions, with the number of atoms undergoing recoil implantation varying linearly with <b>ion</b> <b>dose.</b> Recoil implantation, however, is not the dominant process in ion beam mixing. Most relocated atoms are part of a collision cascade in which recoiled atoms initiate a series of lower energy lattice displacements, which is referred to as cascade mixing. Ion beam mixing can be further enhanced by heat spike effects ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cumulative}} {{heavy ion}} doses in space are low such that critical cells and cell components will receive only 0 or 1 particle traversal. The cumulative heavy <b>ion</b> <b>dose</b> for a Mars mission near solar minimum would be ~0.05 Gy and lower for missions {{at other times}} in the solar cycle. This suggests dose-rate effects will not occur for heavy ions {{as long as the}} total doses used in experimental studies in reasonably small (<~0.1 Gy). At larger doses (>~0.1 Gy) critical cells and cell components could receive more than one particle traversal, which is not reflective of the deep space environment for extended duration missions such as a mission to Mars. An alternative assumption would be if a tissues micro-environment is modified by a long-range signaling effect or change to biochemistry, whereby a particle traversal to some cells modifies the response of other cells not traversed by particles. There is limited experimental evidence, especially for central nervous system effects, available to evaluate this alternative assumption.|$|E
40|$|The Helium Ion Microscope (HIM) is a {{new tool}} capable of imaging at resolutions not {{possible}} in the ubiquitous Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). However, along with this improvement in imaging, the helium ions used in HIM cause greater damage to samples. Reducing <b>ion</b> <b>doses</b> decreases the amount of damage incurred {{at the expense of}} increased noise in the final image. Motivated by the damage to samples inherent in HIM imaging, the possibility of imaging at low <b>ion</b> <b>doses</b> is investigated. A two-parameter Neyman Type A model of pixelwise Ion induced Secondary Electron (iSE) emission is introduced. This model takes into account randomness in both the Poisson emission of helium ions and the Poisson emission of iSE per each incident helium ion. HIM images are simulated for low <b>ion</b> <b>doses.</b> Using the Neyman Type A model, an image formation algorithm is developed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

50|$|Ion {{bombardment}} of a surface {{may result in}} a drastic change of its chemical composition and structure. These changes include sputtering, amorphization, implantation, diffusion, chemical reactions, and so on. All these changes are limited to a very small region surrounding the path of the primary ion into the solid. For Static SIMS each subsequent primary ion hits an undamaged area and total of only 0.1-1% of the atomic sites are bombarded during the measurement. To ensure this very low primary current densities are used generally in the range of 10−10 - 10−9 A/cm² (primary <b>ion</b> <b>dose</b> is below 1012 - 1013 ions/cm2). This leads to extremely small sputtering rates of fraction of a monolayer per hour and hence small secondary ion current density. Additionally, these emitted secondary ions are of low kinetic energy and emitted up to 20 nm from the impact site with surface annealing occurring in femto-seconds. These reasons make SSIMS a purely surface analysis technique causing negligible damage to the surface and with detection limit as low as 10−8 monolayer (ML).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to examine the}} influence of oxalic acid formed on the degradation of phenol by Fenton reagent. Oxalic acid formed at initial stage within 30 min significantly suppresses the reduction of ferric ion, thus terminating degradation reaction. The yield of oxalic acid is dependent on the amount of ferrous <b>ion</b> <b>dosed</b> since the minimal amount of oxalic acid is formed after the degradation reaction terminates. Mineralization of phenol by Fenton reagent stagnates after 120 min under the conditions used in this study. The reason why the mineralization stagnated can be assumed to be following two mechanisms other than the depletion of H(2) O(2). In the case where a small amount of ferrous <b>ions</b> is <b>dosed,</b> the reduction of ferric ions is minimal by oxalic acid formed. In the case where a large amount of ferrous <b>ions</b> is <b>dosed,</b> the amount of degradable organic compounds is insufficient owing to preferential conversion to oxalic acid. The mineralization can be enhanced by the intermittent <b>dosing</b> of ferrous <b>ions,</b> which facilitates the suppression of oxalic acid formation during the degradation by Fenton reagent...|$|R
