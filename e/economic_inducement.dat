60|$|Though {{the good}} city of Paris {{appears to be}} less in fashion than in other days with those representatives of our race--not always, perhaps, {{acknowledged}} as the soundest and stiffest--curious of foreign opportunity and addicted to foreign sojourns, it probably none the less remains true that such frequentations of France as may be said still to flourish among us have as much as ever the wondrous capital, and the wondrous capital alone, for their object. The taste for Paris, at all events, is--or perhaps I should say was, alluding as I do, I fear, to a vanished order--a taste by itself; singularly little bound up, of necessity, with such {{an interest in the}} country at large as would be implied by an equal devotion, in other countries, to other capitals. Putting aside the <b>economic</b> <b>inducement,</b> which may always operate, and limiting the matter to the question of free choice, it is sufficiently striking that the free chooser would have to be very fond of England to quarter himself in London, very fond of Germany to quarter himself in Berlin, very fond of America to quarter himself in New York. It had, on the other hand, been a common reflection for the author of these light pages that the fondness for France (throughout the company of strangers more or less qualified) was oddly apt to feed only on such grounds for it as made shift to spread their surface between the Arc de Triomphe and the Gymnase Theatre: as if there were no good things in the doux pays that could not be harvested in that field. It matters little how the assumption began to strike him as stupid, especially since he himself had doubtless equally shared in the guilt of it. The light pages in question are but the simple record of a small personal effort to shake it off. He took, it must be confessed, no extraordinary measures; he merely started, one rainy morning in mid-September, for the charming little city of Tours, where he felt that he might as immediately as anywhere else see it demonstrated that, though France might be Paris, Paris was by no means France. The beauty of the demonstration--quite as prompt as he could have desired--drew him considerably farther, and his modest but eminently successful adventure begot, as aids to amused remembrance, a few informal notes.|$|E

Of key {{interest is the}} comparison of a township, farm and urban primary school that identify indicators that promote education for sustainable development in schools that implement an environmental management system. Data are drawn from one-on-one interviews, focus group interviews, observations and document analysis from 35 participants in three schools.

Data from the township school revealed that socioeconomic factors and organisational structure promote education for sustainable development.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the military in Tunisia and Libya during the 2010 - 2011 Arab uprisings by asking why the two states’ military forces chose to either defect from or defend the ruling administration. Using a comparative case study methodology, this study demonstrates that the joint configuration of energy capacity, military structure and the strength of protests led to the different outcomes in these two cases. The data indicates that one can understand the impact of these three factors using theories that focus on the correlation between rational action, institutional identity, <b>economic</b> <b>inducements,</b> and ideological stances. Thus, I employed approaches from rational choice and institutionalism as the theoretical framework for this study. This study shows that the actions of the Tunisian and Libyan military forces should be read through this theoretical framework. While informative, conclusions drawn from these cases do not allow for universal generalizations. Additionally, {{it is important to note}} that the three influential factors are not the only elements that influenced the variations in outcome during the Tunisian and Libyan conflicts. Moreover, I do not make a comparison in terms of the absolute values of the factors, but rather in terms of relative values...|$|R

40|$|While {{much work}} has {{examined}} approaches to increase uptake {{of a variety}} of household environmental, health and energy technologies, researchers and policymakers alike have struggled to ensure long-term use. Drawing on a pilot-scale experiment conducted in rural Cambodia, this study evaluates whether economic incentives enhance continued use of—and fuel savings from—improved cookstoves (ICS). Capital-cost subsidies that have been traditionally employed to enhance ICS adoption were augmented with rebates linked to stated and objectively measured use in order to investigate impacts on both initial and sustained adoption in the treatment group. Results show that households do respond to these rebates by adopting the intervention ICS at significantly higher rates, and by using it more frequently and for longer periods. Consistent with these stove-use patterns, solid-fuel use and time spent collecting or preparing fuels also decline. However, this effect appears to diminish over time. Thus, while <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> may significantly increase adoption and use of new environmental health technologies, corresponding reductions in environmental or livelihood burdens are not guaranteed. Additional research on the design and implementation of incentive-based interventions targeting households directly—such as carbon financing or other forms of results-based financing (RBF) for improved cookstoves—therefore seems warranted prior to wider implementation of such solutions...|$|R
40|$|Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) {{is caused}} by Naegleria fowleri, a {{free-living}} amoeba that occasionally infects humans. While considered "rare" (but likely underreported) the high mortality rate and lack of established success in treatment makes PAM a particularly devastating infection. In the absence of <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> to invest in development of anti-PAM drugs by the pharmaceutical industry, anti-PAM drug discovery largely relies on drug 'repurposing'-a cost effective strategy to apply known drugs for treatment of rare or neglected diseases. Similar to fungi, N. fowleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated interventional strategy against fungal pathogens of medical and agricultural importance. The N. fowleri genome encodes the sterol 14 -demethylase (CYP 51) target sharing ~ 35 % sequence identity to fungal orthologues. The similarity of targets raises the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs and optimization of their usage {{for the treatment of}} PAM. In this work, we (i) systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs, known as conazoles, on sterol biosynthesis and viability of cultured N. fowleri trophozotes, (ii) identified the endogenous CYP 51 substrate by mass spectrometry analysis of N. fowleri lipids, and (iii) analyzed the interactions between the recombinant CYP 51 target and conazoles by UV-vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Collectively, the target-based and parasite-based data obtained in these studies validated CYP 51 as a potentially 'druggable' target in N. fowleri, and conazole drugs as the candidates for assessment in the animal model of PAM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Yom Kippur War in October 1973 {{led to an}} American peace {{effort in}} the Middle East. From November 1973 to September 1975, the American Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, {{negotiated}} between the Israelis, the Egyptians, and the Syrians in a negotiation effort, named step-by-step diplomacy. Kissinger managed to secure two agreements between Israel and Egypt and one agreement between Israel and Syria in this period. This thesis examines the negotiation effort between Israel and Egypt and bases the research primarily on declassified Hebrew language documents from the Israel State Archives (ISA). In order to solidify the agreements, Kissinger was obliged to accommodate {{the demands of the}} strongest party, and to make <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> to Israel part of the substance of the agreements. It was thereby Kissinger s power of leverage as American secretary of state that assured the success of the diplomacy.

Nevertheless, Kissinger s step-by-step diplomacy did not advance a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict. Except for the positive sanctions, which the Israeli government of Yitzhak Rabin secured as part of the interim agreements, were also assurances from the American President, Gerald Ford, about the conditions for future Israeli-Arab diplomacy on the other fronts. The interim agreement thereby strengthened the strategic Israeli-American relationship and decreased the pressure on Israel for an implementation of UN Security Council resolution 242 for the following years...|$|R
40|$|According to the Swedish Forestry Act, {{environmental}} protection is required within forest operations regardless of forest ownership. This thesis examines {{the extent to}} which regulations issued by the National Board of Forestry are implemented in clearcuttings. Different factors contributing to the outcome of {{environmental protection}} are analyzed both from a top-down and a bottom-up perspec­tive. Empirically, the study combines field investigation of clearcuts, interviews with implementing actors, and evaluation of written prescriptions and advice on environ­mental protection. The Swedish forest-environmental legislation and implementation process is also compared to that of the U. S. and, especially, to the state of Cali­fornia. Conflicting goals within the Forestry Act and vague environmental guidelines leave the implementing agency officers with great discretion. Steering attempts by the Forestry Agency are in terms of friendly advice and information. No breaches of the regulations were taken to court during 1980 - 1986 although this is formally possible. There is an average compliance of approximately fifty per cent of the required environmental measures. Aesthetic values are taken into account {{to a greater extent than}} pure floristic and faunistic ones. Economic considerations and harvest technology contribute to a low degree of environmental protection. Forest machines are inadequately suited for protecting single, environmentally valuable trees and they frequently cause deep tracks. Inadequate environmental knowledge and insufficient pre-harvest environmental planning also affect environ­mental performance negatively. Generally, economic considerations contribute to the low priority to environ­mental protection given by the implementing actors compared to timber production. <b>Economic</b> <b>inducements</b> counteract environmental protection. It is generally rare that environmentalists and other public interests affected by forest operations are consulted. Environmentalists however influence indirectly through political pressure to legislate, participation in the consultation process before legislation is enacted, and mass-media attention. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{dissertation}} is to examine the causes of the Second Punic War as given by two prominent ancient historians, Polybius and Livy, the key sources for the modern reader studying the conflict. To set the scene, the First and Second Punic Wars, as well as the period between the wars, are discussed. The two historians, different in style and personality, and the sources they used, are examined. ^ The dissertation contends that Polybius and Livy agree on three causes: the 2 ̆ 2 wrath of the Barcids, 2 ̆ 2 revenge for the loss of Sardinia and Corsica, and the success of the Carthaginians in Spain. Livy views the seizure of Saguntum as a cause; Polybius feels {{this is the beginning of}} the war rather than an underlying cause. After discussing the facts available on each of the causes, the dissertation maintains that all four causes are sustainable. The primary objection to the ancient causes is that they are too pro-Roman. In reality, the revenge factor reflects poorly on the Romans and legality may rest with Hannibal 2 ̆ 7 s on the seizure of Saguntum. This last issue continues to be hotly debated. ^ Other possibilities for the Second Punic War are briefly analyzed including the inevitability of the conflict, the miscalculation of Roman motives by the Carthaginians, <b>economic</b> <b>inducements,</b> imperialism, and the character of Hannibal. With the exception of the miscalculation of Roman motives, all of the additional possibilities could be added to the Polybian/Livian causes. Perhaps the key is Hannibal himself who pressed the issue of war. Thus, the ancients were limited in their analysis by their cultural milieu; however, the ancient causes stand the test of time. ^ There are two appendices to the dissertation. The first discusses the one remaining portrait of Polybius, the stele at Kleitor. The second appendix examines different portraits of Livy from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries. There is a surprising consistency in his portrayal, although period influences can be seen. ...|$|R

40|$|Christine Milne {{argues that}} much of the nation’s {{economic}} prosperity is a veneer. The three clearest expressions of our economic vulnerability are the inter-related problems of our high greenhouse gas emissions, our looming domestic oil shortage and our ongoing economic dependence on natural resources. It is these three interlinked problems that this paper addresses. To solve these interconnected problems, federal and state governments will need to develop a wide range of strategies in a coordinated way. Some will be regulatory levers, some will provide <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> and some will impose economic penalties; but all will create new economic opportunities. Critics might argue that governments should not intervene but should leave the transition to a low carbon, oilindependent and low resource-use economy to the free market. Government-driven measures are needed because the present distorted marketplace is failing the environment; in Sir Nicholas Stern 2 ̆ 7 s ringing indictment 2 ̆ 7 Climate change presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen 2 ̆ 7. Throughout the 20 th century it was assumed that economic growth could be pursued with little consideration of its environmental consequences, and that any pollution or resource-scarcity challenges would be solved by technological advances or by simply going out and finding more. At the start of the 21 st century, climate change and oil depletion have delivered a reality check. The silver lining of climate change is that it gives us the opportunity to reconsider the way we live. We know that we have to change; we know that we have to rethink the economy so that it operates within the earth’s ecological limits if we are to avoid the collapse of human civilisation. What is less well understood is that this transformation also gives us the opportunity to create enormous economic benefits in sectors hitherto neglected; changes which can make us happier, healthier, and more secure in the knowledge that our children will inherit a world that is a joy to live in. There is an emerging consensus that nations and corporations that fail to understand this imperative will lose competitive advantage; while those that grasp the new opportunities it offers will prosper. This report details the need for this transformation, the policy options and the strategies to achieve it, and the opportunities such a transformation would create. Refining, costing, choosing between options and implementing these strategies will require significant consultation with stakeholders, all levels of government and the wider community...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} my {{dissertation}} is British philanthropic literature, beginning in 1723 with Bernard Mandeville’s controversial criticism of public charity {{and ending with}} Jonas Hanway, arguably the most famous figure in the eighteenth-century London charity scene, in the 1750 s. Henry Fielding’s novel Tom Jones (1749) and William Dodd’s novels The Sisters; or the History of Lucy and Caroline Sanson (1754) and the posthumous The Magdalen or, History of the First Penitent Prostitute (1783) round out this project, which also considers sermons, economist treatise, histories, travel writing, reform proposals, and philosophical essays as philanthropic literature. The range of fiction and nonfiction texts, which I categorize as philanthropic literature, help answer crucial questions about how social institutions formed {{with the goal of}} assisting the poor actually reinforced social and economic inequality. Those questions include, how was poverty theorized as economic problems, social problems, or class problems? And how was philanthropy represented as an answer to those problems? How were the poor defined, proscribed, and confined by these different concerns? Finally, how were philanthropic institutions shaped by discourses of gender, class, and empire? During this period, the poor were consistently viewed {{as a threat to the}} existing social and economic order due to their laziness, ignorance, and criminal nature. The poor laws and workhouses, alongside charitable societies with their associated schools and hospitals, all sought to make the poor more socially useful through discipline, education, or a combination of the two. Over the course of the eighteenth-century, I argue, philanthropic writing expresses several important changes in the institutional mission and strategies of public charities. First, philanthropic literature move from adamantly rejecting any possible link between benevolence and personal gain to promoting charity using a combination of nationalistic, religious, and <b>economic</b> <b>inducements.</b> Second, there is a shift from considering somatic to mental disciplinary methods as a means of control over the poor. Thus, philanthropic writers in the 1750 s begin promoting choice and self-surveillance rather than force and public surveillance as elements of charity. After establishing the economic and moral terms, which undergirded charity, this dissertation considers the ways different authors associated with the eighteenthcentury London philanthropic community represent the poor, imagine charity, and attempt to shape public opinion through their writing. Unraveling the logic and practices of the period described by many as the “Age of Philanthropy” helps us to recognize, question, and critique charitable practices and concerns. My examination of the eighteenth-century poor and charity serves as an important reminder that charity is not always synonymous with good; and that philanthropy is not and never has been a benign social institution...|$|R

Our project was designed to examine the emergence of North Korea as a small nuclear power, a process that has been underway since 2009, if not earlier. When the project was first proposed, North Korea had just conducted two long-range rocket tests in 2012 and its third nuclear test in February 2013, highlighting that trend. However, it was unclear where it would lead in the future, namely the size of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent, Pyongyang’s thinking on its nuclear strategy, regional and international implications of a growing nuclear force and possible policy responses of the United States, its allies and the international community.

40|$|Maritime {{transport}} {{is facing}} wide-ranking challenges due to stricter environmental regulations. It has been positioned that these stricter environmental regulations will significantly hamper {{the competitiveness of}} the shipping industry and other export/import oriented industries. However, contrasting views, arguing that environmental regulations will, in fact, enhance firms' competitiveness by inducing innovation, have also been voiced. Here, this issue is examined through a literature review on the innovation inducement impact of environmental regulations (i. e., the Porter Hypothesis), in general, and the economic impacts of environmental regulations (here Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention) {{as it applies to}} shipping in Northern Europe, in particular. According to the review, the literature is still inconclusive and lacks a clear consensus on the <b>economic</b> and innovation <b>inducement</b> impacts of environmental regulations on maritime transport. Therefore, the review concludes in suggestions for further studies on the use of marine scrubber systems as an illustrative case study example...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{sources such}} as British Cabinet, Foreign Office, and Prime Minister 2 ̆ 7 s papers, {{published}} documents, Parliamentary records, diaries, and memoirs, this study analyzes the formation and implementation of Britain 2 ̆ 7 s policy toward Italy during the period 1933 - 1940. The entire focus of this analysis is directed toward Britain 2 ̆ 7 s appeasement tactics since Italian initiatives, reactions, and opinions are solely viewed {{from the standpoint of}} their impact upon the thinking of British officials. In essence, British leaders believed that prospects for the preservation of peace in Europe would be enhanced by the cultivation of cordial Anglo-Italian relations. More specifically, they reasoned that the existence of harmonious relations between Britain and Italy would prevent Mussolini from joining Hitler in a collective pursuit of aggrandizement. At first, it appeared that Britain 2 ̆ 7 s plan to divide the dictators would be quite effective. For instance, after the assassination of Austria 2 ̆ 7 s Chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss, in July, 1934, Mussolini sent four Italian divisions to the Brenner Pass as a direct warning to Hitler that Italy would not tolerate a German absorption of Austria. In addition, at the Stresa Conference of April, 1935, Italy joined Britain and France in condemning German rearmament. Throughout the next five years, however, Britain 2 ̆ 7 s relations with Italy deteriorated. From the Ethiopian crisis to Italy 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the Second World War on 11 June 1940, the Italians provided the British with a series of irritations. For example, Italy conquered Ethiopia, established the axis with Germany, aided the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, acquiesced in the Anschluss, violated the provisions of the Anglo-Italian accord, demanded territory from France, conquered Albania, signed a military alliance with Germany, and terminated its non-belligerent status in the war in spite of numerous <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> offered by Britain. Despite all these setbacks, Britain did not abandon its policy of cultivating amicable relations with Italy until it became obvious that Italy was not about to cooperate consistently with Britain in an effort to preserve tranquil conditions. Eight years of British appeasement measures, therefore, had ultimately failed to avert a confrontation with Italy. In evaluating the nature of British policy, the advocates of appeasing Italy were not merely a collection of cowards who feared a military encounter. The appeasers believed that Mussolini simply could not continue to pursue personal glory {{at the expense of the}} long-range interests of Italy. These arguments possessed some merit until Italy accepted the Anschluss. After this, Britain 2 ̆ 7 s entire orientation toward Italy should have been modified since Italy 2 ̆ 7 s behavior had demonstrated that Britain 2 ̆ 7 s special efforts to maintain cordial ties with Italy were not producing the desired results in international politics. The persistence of the policy of appeasing Italy in spite of several major disappointments was primarily traceable to the determination of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax to prevent Italy from becoming a direct opponent of Britain. In conclusion, the tenacity with which the appeasers clung to their beliefs concerning Italy reflected both the sincerity and the shortsightedness of their thinking...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{organisational}} commitment of {{employees in the}} context of Jordanian banking industry. It aims at exploring this concept and identifying the factors that may influence it. Commitment was measured by using the Organisational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ). Additional questions about background characteristics of subjects were also included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 250 subjects and 144 usable responses were used. The most salient findings of this study are: 1. Bankers in Jordan are committed to their organisation. The results do not reveal any significant differences between Jordanian bankers and their counterparts in other countries in terms of level of {{organisational commitment}}. 2. Old, high salaried and experiences bankers are more committed than young low salaried and unexperienced bankers. This indicates that Jordanian bankers express the side-bet theory of commitment (calculative commitment) in which individuals exchange commitment for <b>economic</b> rewards or <b>inducements.</b> 3. Female bankers are less committed than their male counterparts...|$|R
40|$|People are {{frequently}} exposed to potentially attractive {{events that are}} subsequently and unexpectedly reversed and to potentially painful events, which are also unexpectedly reversed. In {{the process of being}} returned to the initial asset position, does the sequence in which the positive and negative events occur matter? This issue of the combined effect of pleasurable and painful stimuli has received scant theoretical or empirical attention. We attempt to fill this lacuna in the literature by studying the retrospective evaluation of surprises that return individuals to their original economic state. Although such surprises do not change an individual's original economic state, we argue that the individual's psychological state changes, and the final affective state is, among other things, a function of the sequence in which the events occur. From a theoretical standpoint, several perspectives can be brought to bear on the issue. For instance, one reading of mental accounting, based on prospect theory's value function, would predict that losses should dominate gains, and therefore, regardless of sequence, people should be unhappy when exposed to two economically equivalent outcomes of different signs. Conversely, the literature on intertemporal choice would suggest that a series that ends on an up note is preferred to a series that ends on a down note, because people like to defer gratification so that they may savor positive outcomes. Similarly, people apparently have a preference for "happy endings. " Finally, the extant literature on "recency effects" would predict that the last event in a series should have a disproportionate influence on overall affect. Our model relies on a shift in the reference point to explain how a surprising reversal of an event will lead to a nonzero evaluation of the sequence. We suggest that people's reference points shift immediately but imperfectly after a stimulus is presented. Intuitively, this implies that the first stimulus will shift the reference point in its direction, as a result of which the evaluation of a sequence of events in which an initial event is unexpectedly reversed will be more favorable if the first event is a loss than if it is a gain. This model captures the unanticipated nature of the second event (i. e., the surprise element) by allowing the first event to move the reference point. Consequently, by the time the next event occurs the reference point has been updated, as a result of which the zero economic outcome of the sequence yields nonzero utility. We further posit that the magnitude of the reference point shift should be affected by the time elapsed between the two stimuli. Specifically, the reference point shifts gradually with time, until it is fully updated. Consequently, the final affective state of the sequence is also a function of the temporal distance between the two events. The main predictions of the model were empirically supported first in a survey using a mall-intercept sample. Subsequently, we conducted a study of student subjects involving a coin-tossing game in which real money was at stake and in which subjects in one condition experienced the second outcome after a two-day delay. Our results from this second study supported the model's prediction regarding the impact of the elapsed time between the events. The experimental tasks involved surprising reversals of initial outcomes, thus ensuring that "savoring/dread" types of explanations (which require that subjects anticipate the second event) could not be operating. Finally, in a series of three follow-up studies, we tested the claim that the magnitude of outcomes would have an impact on observed affect, and consistent with our theory and contrary to recency predictions, we observed similar results across different magnitudes. While theoretically interesting, we should also note that our research is of potential pragmatic significance. People's reactions to a series of events is of considerable interest to marketers desirous of generating enhanced attitude, affect, purchase intention, and the like without offering <b>economic</b> <b>inducements</b> such as rebates, coupons, or other costly discounts. Additionally, public policy officials may be interested in protecting people from being manipulated into purchasing a product simply because of changes in the sequence in which a series of offers is made by the merchant.

40|$|This paper derives policy {{recommendations}} {{from a new}} understanding of countries unwilling to renounce nuclear designs, or “fence-sitters. ” These are the few states reluctant to commit themselves fully and effectively to a global or regional nonproliferation regime. Academic and foreign policy experts and practitioners alike have traditionally explained the behavior of fence-sitters in terms of fundamental problems of physical survival in an anarchic world. While accepting this fundamental premise, I suggest that fence-sitters have a choice of instruments for coping with security problems. Some have maintained ambiguous nuclear policies; others have chosen to commit to nuclear nonproliferation while embarking on a strategy of integration into the global political economy. Domestic politics largely influenced whether fence-sitters chose one path or the other. The opening section of this paper explores why it is imperative to bring domestic politics more explicitly into the study of nonproliferation. The section following suggests one plausible approach: outlining the relationship between domestic political coalitions and alternative nuclear postures. I then draw out the practical implications of a domestic focus for multilateral efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such efforts would include designing multilateral <b>economic</b> sanctions and <b>inducements</b> aimed at domestic targets; evaluating the indirect effects on nuclear postures of International Monetary Fund (IMF) -style conditionality arrangements; promoting supportive nonproliferation constituencies through the democratic process; and enrolling credible nonproliferation nongovernmental agencies (NGOs) in this effort. The conclusion places the approach suggested here within a wider context of policies aimed at reversing nuclear proliferation, none of which alone opens the gate to the holy grail of global nuclear disarmament...|$|R
