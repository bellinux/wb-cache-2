In the art appraisal domain (Figure 1), agents function as painting appraisers with varying levels of expertise in different artistic eras. Clients request appraisals for paintings from different eras; if an appraising agent does not have the expertise 1 Figure 1 : Game overview, demonstrating interactions between clients and appraiser agents. to complete the appraisal, it can request opinions from other appraiser agents. Appraisers receive more clients, and thus more profit, for producing more accurate appraisals. 2 Client Appraisals In each timestep, multiple clients present each appraiser (agent) with paintings to be appraised, paying a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> <b>f</b> for each appraisal request. To increase business, appraisers attempt to valuate paintings as closely to market value as possible. A given painting may belong to any of a finite set of eras (a painting’s era is known by all appraisers), and appraisers have varying levels of expertise in each era. An appraiser’s expertise, defined as its ability to generate an ‘opinion ’ about the value of a painting, is described by a normal distribution of the error between 2 the appraiser’s opinion and the true painting value. The simulation creates opinions according to this error distribution, which has a mean of zero and a standard deviation s given by s =(s ∗ +...|$|E

We show that the patent holder prefers to license by means of up-front <b>fixed</b> <b>fees</b> except if market competition is mild and the innovation size is small. Once there is private information about the relative bargaining power of the parties, the patent holder may prefer licensing by means of per-unit royalties even if market competition is strong.

40|$|In {{the context}} of a Cournot duopoly, this paper studies the {{licensing}} of a cost-reducing innovation by means of three possible allocation mechanisms: auction, <b>fixed</b> <b>fee,</b> and direct negotiation. Once the use of an arbitrary reserve price (which is not credible) has been excluded, it is no longer true that auction always yields higher profit to the patentee than a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee.</b> However, the authors propose a direct negotiation mechanism which restores the patentee’s profit to the level of an auction with an arbitrary reserve price (which is unimplementable). Direct negotiation is superior to both an auction with a nonarbitrary reserve price and a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee.</b> From the social point of view, however, licensing with a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> is the best option...|$|R

40|$|We analyze two part tariffs in oligopoly, {{where each}} firm in {{addition}} to the standard quantity commitment also commits to a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> prior to determination of unit prices. In the case of homogeneous consumers, Harrison and Kline (2001) show the the equilibrium involve marginal cost pricing and positive <b>fixed</b> <b>fees,</b> whatever the number of firms. We show that these results are reversed when we allow for heterogeneous consumers. In particular, we find that price per unit can exceed marginal costs, and the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> can be below costs if the firms are forced to serve all consumers. We also show that two part tariffs may collapse, because each firm would rather commit to a traditional Cournot price system (zero <b>fixed</b> <b>fee).</b> Finally, some numerical examples illustrate that both firms serving both types of consumers can be an equilibrium outcome in duopoly in cases where the monopolist would serve only one type of consumers...|$|R

40|$|The {{format of}} pricing {{contracts}} varies substantially across business contexts, a major variable being whether a contract imposes a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> payment. This paper examines how {{the use of}} the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> in pricing contracts affects market outcomes of a manufacturer-retailer channel. Standard economic theories predict that channel efficiency increases with the introduction of the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> and is invariant to its framing. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Surprisingly, the introduction of the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> fails to increase channel efficiency. Moreover, the framing of the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> does make a difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent. To account for these anomalies, we generalize the standard economic model by allowing the retailer's utilities to be reference dependent so that the up-front <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> payment is perceived as a loss and the subsequent retail profits as a gain. We embed this reference-dependent utility function in a quantal response equilibrium framework where the retailer is allowed to make decision mistakes due to computational complexity. The key prediction of this behavioral model is that channel efficiency decreases with loss aversion for sufficiently Nash-rational retailers. Consistent with this prediction, the estimated loss-aversion coefficient is 1. 37 in the two-part tariff condition, significantly higher than 1. 27 in the quantity discount condition. At the same time, loss aversion dominates contract complexity in explaining the data. Lastly, we conduct a follow-up experiment to confirm the central role of loss aversion as a behavioral driver. In one condition, the retailer becomes less loss averse when we temporally compress the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> payment and the realization of retail profits, which supports the loss aversion theory. In the other condition, the retailer's contract acceptance rate does not decline when we reward the manufacturer a higher cash payment for each experimental point earned, which rules out the competing hypothesis that the retailer rejects contract offers due to fairness concerns. <b>fixed</b> <b>fee,</b> two-part tariffs, quantity discounts, distribution channels, loss aversion, behavioral economics, experimental economics...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{investment}} possibilities by licensees and nonlicensees affect the two-part licensing contracts offered by an innovator not {{participating in a}} homogeneous good oligopolistic market. By undertaking some investments after the decision to accept or reject the licensing contract, licensees and nonlicensees can decrease their marginal production cost. However, the innovation provides a technological headstart in the continuing process of marginal cost improvement. We find that the two-part equilibrium contracts can be of three types: (i) a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> contract such that all firms become licensees; (ii) a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> contract such {{that the number of}} licensees is smaller than the number of firms in the market; and, (iii) a contract that specifies a positive royalty rate and a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> such that all firms become licensees. licensing, headstart, investment, contracts,...|$|R
40|$|How {{should the}} payment be {{structured}} when external firms acquire or license patents from individual inventors or small firms? Variable fees, such as equity sharing or royalties, provide incentives for inventor effort during the commercialization. <b>Fixed</b> <b>fees</b> provide incentives {{to the external}} firm to make investments in the commercialization process. Excluding either variable or <b>fixed</b> <b>fees</b> from the contract leads to a moral hazard problem. By including both variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>fees,</b> the incentives of the inventor and the firm become more aligned. The performance of licensed and acquired patents with different payment structures has, however, seldom been analyzed empirically. Based on a detailed database on Swedish patents, I use a survival model to estimate how the commercialization decision and the payment structure influence the patent renewal decision. I find that that commercialization substantially increases the probability of renewal, but only for patents which are (i) commercialized by the original owner or (ii) licensed/acquired using both variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>fees.</b> If the contract relies uniquely on either <b>fixed</b> or variable <b>fees,</b> the probability of renewal is as low as for patents that are not commercialized at all. The results are inconclusive, however, since the difference in renewal between acquired/licensed patents with different terms is not statistically significant...|$|R

When the innovation is intermediate I find that <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> is better than a royalty.
