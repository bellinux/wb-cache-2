5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although <b>digital</b> <b>photography,</b> which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

There are around 1,700 full-time students with part-time students making {{up the majority of}} the student population. Arbroath is not a student town and there are no student residences in the town. The student population is made up solely of local students living within commuting distance of the college. Angus College offers courses up to Higher National Diploma (HND) level in a variety of trade related and academic disciplines from construction to Social Sciences, as well as a sizeable number of programs relating to computing, information technology and office administration. A large number of the student body are mature students taking evening classes related to computing, <b>digital</b> <b>photography</b> and various software packages.|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of one-field non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography</b> and direct ophthalmoscopy for diabetic retinopathy(DR) screening, compared with fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA). METHODS:All 93 patients of type 1 or 2 diabetic who have underwent one-field non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography,</b> and direct ophthalmoscopy with dilation of their pupils, and FFA by ophthalmologists. The sensitivity and specificity of one-field non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography</b> and direct ophthalmoscopy were calculated respectively, compared with FFA. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of one-field non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography</b> for detection of any DR were 80. 4 % and 94. 7 %; The sensitivity and specificity of direct ophthalmoscopy for detection of any DR were 64. 2 % and 84. 2 %; After the standard for referable DR being lowered down to the moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy(M-NPDR), the sensitivity and specificity of non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography</b> for detection were 88. 9 % and 98. 4 %, the sensitivity and specificity of direct ophthalmoscopy for detection were 71. 5 % and 96. 7 %. CONCLUSION: One-field non-mydriatic <b>digital</b> fundus <b>photography</b> is an effective method for DR screening...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceAerial {{photogrammetry}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} methods obtaining geospatial information. After entering the 21 st century, aerial photogrammetry technology has fully entered the digital age, and the quality of <b>digital</b> aerial <b>photography</b> results will directly affect the quality and accuracy of results of surveying and mapping. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the quality of <b>digital</b> aerial <b>photography</b> results. In the process of <b>digital</b> aerial <b>photography,</b> flight quality directly affects the quality of the results. It is of great importance to make its flight quality inspection. Based on the analysis of flight quality index of the results of <b>digital</b> aerial <b>photography</b> and domestic and international current situation of quality inspection technology of aerial photography results, the author has researched and has posed inspection index and automatic inspection methods of flight quality of the results of digital aerial photography; they can be applied to check index, such as longitudinal overlapping degree, lateral overlapping degree, rotation angle, andthe curvature of airline of images, to realize automatic quality inspection of flight quality of the results of <b>digital</b> aerial <b>photography...</b>|$|R
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for <b>digital</b> <b>photography</b> even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
