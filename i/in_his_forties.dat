5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>forties</b> and had been severely injured in {{a fire in the}} summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E

Registered as Gerasimos Saffirinos, he was presenting himself as an ardent Philhellene to his teachers. Safirin also asked to be examined ahead of other students: at the time, he had been promised {{a seat on the}} Synod, {{and did not want to}} miss out on the opportunity. The professors refused to do so without explicit permission from the Romanian Metropolitan Iosif Gheorghian, who refused to grant it. Safirin returned home in 1894, and until 1899, was again employed by Râmnic seminary, this time as a teacher of Latin.|$|E

25|$|Aged 17, {{she agreed}} to marry Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky, a man <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>forties</b> who worked as Vice Governor of Erivan Province. Her reasons for doing so were unclear, {{although}} she later claimed that she was attracted by his belief in magic. Although she tried to back out shortly before the wedding ceremony, the marriage took place on 7 July 1849. Moving {{with him to the}} Sardar Palace, she made repeated unsuccessful attempts to escape and return to her family in Tiflis, to which he eventually relented. The family sent her, accompanied by a servant and maid, to Odessa to meet her father, who planned to return to Saint Petersburg with her. The escorts accompanied her to Poti and then Kerch, intending to continue with her to Odessa. Blavatsky claimed that, fleeing her escorts and bribing the captain of the ship that had taken her to Kerch, she reached Constantinople. This marked the start of nine years spent traveling the world, possibly financed by her father.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{spokesman}} for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, only 100 of the 1300 houses in the town remained after the war. In spite of the widespread destruction in Ayta ash-Sha'b, there were surprisingly few civilian casualties. According to Lebanese sources only seven civilian residents were killed in the war. The main reason for this seems to have been that the great majority of the civilian population had been evacuated from the town early in the conflict. According to a Human Rights Watch report two of the civilian fatalities were actually killed outside the town. On 19 July Safa Salah Jawad, aged 7, and her brother Kawthar, 4, were killed when an 155mm artillery shell struck the private home in the nearby Christian village of Rumaysh, where the family had sought refuge after being evacuated from Ayta ash-Sha'b. One man was killed 20 July by an missile fired by a helicopter. An elderly couple and their son <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>forties</b> were killed the day after when their home was destroyed by an air strike.|$|E
