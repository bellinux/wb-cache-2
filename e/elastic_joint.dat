In the present study, wave propagation across single and multiple parallel joints filled with viscoelastic medium is examined.

40|$|The use of multi-body {{optimisation}} (MBO) {{to estimate}} joint kinematics from stereophotogrammetric data while compensating for soft tissue artefact {{is still open}} to debate. Presently used joint models embedded in MBO, such as mechanical linkages, constitute a considerable simplification of joint function, preventing a detailed understanding of it. The present study proposes a knee joint model where femur and tibia are represented as rigid bodies connected through an elastic element the behaviour of which is described by a single stiffness matrix. The deformation energy, computed from the stiffness matrix and joint angles and displacements, is minimised within the MBO. Implemented as a "soft" constraint using a penalty-based method, this <b>elastic</b> <b>joint</b> description challenges the strictness of "hard" constraints. In this study, estimates of knee kinematics obtained using MBO embedding four different knee joint models (i. e., no constraints, spherical joint, parallel mechanism, and <b>elastic</b> <b>joint)</b> were compared against reference kinematics measured using bi-planar fluoroscopy on two healthy subjects ascending stairs. Bland-Altman analysis and sensitivity analysis investigating the influence of variations in the stiffness matrix terms on the estimated kinematics substantiate the conclusions. The difference between the reference knee joint angles and displacements and the corresponding estimates obtained using MBO embedding the stiffness matrix showed an average bias and standard deviation for kinematics of 0. 9 ± 3. 2 ° and 1. 6 ± 2. 3 mm.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} of {{mechanisms}} with <b>elastic</b> <b>joints,</b> leaf-springs are often used. These have a large in-plane stiffness and a relatively small out-of-plane stiffness, which allows {{the design of}} <b>elastic</b> <b>joints</b> with a large stiffness in some directions, called the support stiffness, and a small stiffness in the complementary directions in which motion is desired, called the drive stiffness. Examples are a parallel leaf-spring guidance as an approximation for a prismatic joint and a cross-spring pivot as an approximation for a revolute joint. The support stiffness decreases when a joint is deflected from its central position. Also imperfections in the leaf-springs {{due to lack of}} flatness or assembly misalignments can have this effect. Residual stresses mainly influence the torsional rigidity of leaf-springs, whereas the influence on the flexural rigidity is non-linear and becomes important near the stability limit. Initial deflections of the order of the thickness of the leaf-springs can already have a significant influence on the support stiffness in the central position...|$|R

40|$|The passive {{dynamics}} of bipedal limbs alone are sufficient {{to produce a}} walking motion, without need for control. Humans augment these dynamics with muscles, actively coordinated to produce stable and economical walking. Present robots using passive dynamics walk much slower, perhaps because they lack elastic muscles that couple the joints. Elastic properties are well known to enhance running gaits, but their effect on walking {{has yet to be}} explored. Here we use a computational model of dynamic walking to show that <b>elastic</b> <b>joint</b> coupling can help to coordinate faster walking. In walking powered by trailing leg push-off, the model's speed is normally limited by a swing leg that moves too slowly to avoid stumbling. A uni-articular spring about the knee allows faster but uneconomical walking. A combination of uni-articular hip and knee springs can speed the legs for improved speed and economy, but not without the swing foot scuffing the ground. Bi-articular springs coupling the hips and knees can yield high economy and good ground clearance similar to humans. An important parameter is the knee-to-hip moment arm that greatly affects the existence and stability of gaits, and when selected appropriately can allow {{for a wide range of}} speeds. <b>Elastic</b> <b>joint</b> coupling may contribute to the economy and stability of human gait...|$|E
40|$|The {{set-point}} regulation {{problem for}} robotic manipulators {{is a basic}} task that can be solved either by PID control or by model-based gravity compensation. These approaches are commonly applied both to rigid arms and to robots with flexible links and/or <b>elastic</b> <b>joints.</b> However, PID control requires fine and lengthy tuning of gains {{in order to achieve}} good performance on the whole workspace. Moreover, no global convergence proof has yet been given for this control law in case of flexible links or <b>elastic</b> <b>joints.</b> On the other hand, a constant or even a configuration-dependent gravity compensation is only an approximate solution when an unknown payload is present or when model parameters are poorly estimated. In this paper, a simple iterative scheme is proposed for generating exact gravity compensation at the desired set-point, without the knowledge of dynamic model terms. The resulting control law is shown to be global asymptotically stable for rigid arms as well as for manipulators with <b>elastic</b> <b>joints</b> or flexible links. Starting with a PD action on the error at the joint (viz. motor) level, an additional feedforward term is built and updated at discrete instants. Convergence of the scheme is proved under a mild condition on the proportional gain, related to a bound on the gravity terms. In the presence of concentrated or distributed flexibility, a structural property of the joint or of the link stiffness is further required, largely satisfied in practice. Simulation results are given for a three-link rigid arm while experimental results are also presented for a two-link robot with a flexible forearm...|$|R

40|$|<b>Elastic</b> <b>joints</b> endow robots with {{advantages}} including energy-efficiency, {{safety and}} performance. To optimally actuate such joints, robotic tasks are formulated as optimal control problems with task objectives and their solutions provide the optimal control policies. However, two general challenges while solving these problems exist. They include the mathematical formulation of a task objective, {{due to a}} lack of verifiable control policies and the computation of the optimal solutions due to nonlinearities, state constraints, multiple degrees of freedom, etc. Since humans are considered to be optimizing agents with their innate constraints, a systematic analysis of their movement behaviour might provide clues to tackle these two issues. Therefore, we propose a novel approach where humans can be beneficially employed. For the same, we provide an analysis through experiments during which, subjects learned to manipulate virtual objects which represent <b>elastic</b> <b>joints</b> to perform two control tasks. In the first control task of maximizing the object’s terminal velocity, a cost functional can be easily formulated but the control policy computation is difficult. Humans while performing this task, showed that they are capable of approaching optimal task execution. Their apparent control strategies can be used as initial guesses to reduce the computational difficulties in finding optimal solutions. In the second control task of displacing an elastic object in the shortest time, finding a criterion that can represent a cost function is not straightforward. The cost functionals that were optimized by humans when deciphered, provided insights about the relative weighting of the dominant costs including hand acceleration, hand and object distance. These findings favour the exploration and utilization of human control policies for actuating <b>elastic</b> <b>joints</b> in future research...|$|R
