And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> name.

2500|$|The House of Lords (Lord Porter, Lord Normand, Lord Oaksey, Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe) {{unanimously}} {{found that}} there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. [...] Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making the key question one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would have in mind regarding assumption of this risk. [...] Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. [...] This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. [...] In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that hitting a ball out of the ground was an objective of the game, [...] "and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about". The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what we can <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> everyday lives in an urbanised modern society.|$|E

50|$|The Nineteenth Amendment gave {{women the}} right to vote, as it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> timeline, but it wasn't passed until 1928 (before then, some states gave limited {{suffrage}} to women).|$|R
5000|$|Frontman Matthew Healy {{described}} the style as [...] "pretty experimental, and goes from glitchy R&B to big 80's powerpop to mid 90's soul, but it's <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> way obviously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will try}} a shot with it, Jerry. She {{gave me the}} bag of bullets {{and a box of}} patches and his powder-horn with it. We will see what it will <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hands, we are both pretty good shots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{mean to be}} {{troublesome}} to you,' said she, earnestly; 'I {{shall have}} {{so much more to}} <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own house, that I shall not miss you so much when you are out; besides, we can have Annette to stay with us.' ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, I {{would point}} out that if life is crowned by its success and devotion in {{industrial}} organization and ingenuity, we had better worship the ant and the bee (as moralists urge us to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> childhood), and humble ourselves before the arrogance of the birds of Aristophanes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Colbert, [...] "I've got a {{place for}} Sammy. Right in my office. He's {{to be a man}} of business, you know. He never took much to schooling.

6000|$|... "I believe I am the senior," [...] one of {{the captains}} said; [...] "but I should imagine that Lord Beresford's {{commission}} would, for the time, rank just {{as if it had}} been signed by our own authorities.

60|$|Agam. How! how's this, Patroclus? We are {{too well}} acquainted with these answers. Though he has much desert, yet all his virtues <b>Do</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> eyes begin to lose their gloss.

Tell him this; and add, That if he {{overhold}} his price so much, We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine Not portable, lie lag of all the camp.

60|$|Converts are {{interesting}} people. Most of us, {{if you will}} pardon me for betraying the universal secret, have, at some time or other, discovered in ourselves a readiness to stray far, ever so far, on the wrong road.
