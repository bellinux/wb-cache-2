2500|$|During the Japanese Occupation (February 1942 - September 1945), {{the school}} {{ceased to exist}} as it was shut down by the Japanese {{military}} administration. After the Japanese surrender, the British Military Administration took charge of Singapore and {{attempts were made to}} revive the school again. The school had lost most of its administrative documents, records, its former students and teachers at the aftermath of the war. The school was finally re-opened on the premises of Outram School by headmaster, Percival Frank Aroozoo on 13 May 1946. Aroozoo, a Eurasian of Portuguese descent was the grandson of Simon Aroozoo, who happened to be a close friend and colleague of Gan Eng Seng when both men worked together at Guthrie and Company for fifty years. A year later, the school was moved to the former Japanese National School building (now the Stamford Arts Centre) at No. 155 Waterloo Street and remained there until 1951. During this period, GESS was still a primary school. The teething problems were soon over and on December 1949, Aroozoo launched the school's periodical, Onward to chronicalise the legacy and milestones of the school. On 29 May 1950, GESS became the first school in Singapore to form the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Its formation was an initiative by Aroozoo: [...] "Parents as much as the teacher has a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the training and development of a child as a useful member of the community." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several historians {{counter the}} {{argument}} that reparations caused the inflation and collapse of the mark. Gerhard Weinberg writes that Germany refused to pay by, and that doing so destroyed their own currency. Anthony Lentin agrees and writes that inflation was [...] "a consequence of the war rather than of the peace" [...] and that hyperinflation {{was a result of}} the [...] "German government's reckless issue of paper money" [...] during the Allied occupation of the Ruhr. British and French experts believed that the Mark was being sabotaged to avoid budgetary and currency reform and to evade reparations. Sally Marks writes that the Germans claimed that reparations destroyed the Mark. Marks writes that historians who say reparations caused hyperinflation have overlooked [...] "that the inflation long predated reparations" [...] and the way [...] "inflation mushroomed" [...] between mid-1921 and the end of 1922 [...] "when Germany was actually paying very little in reparations" [...] and have failed to explain why [...] "the period of least inflation coincided with the period of largest reparation payments...or why Germans claimed after 1930 that reparations were causing deflation". She writes [...] "there is no doubt that British and French suspicions late in 1922 were sound". Marks also writes that the [...] "astronomic inflation which ensued was a result of German policy", whereby the government paid for passive resistance in the Ruhr [...] "from an empty exchequer" [...] and paid off its domestic and war debts with worthless marks. Bell agrees and writes that [...] "inflation had little direct connection with reparation payments themselves, but a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the way the German government chose to subsidize industry and to pay the costs of passive resistance to the occupation [...] by extravagant use of the printing press". Bell also writes that hyperinflation was not an inevitable consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, but was among the actual results.|$|E

The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine {{going on in the world}} and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E

This paper focuses on an aspect of data that has been infrequently examined in the database marketing literature – managing quality of data resources from a profit perspective. The notion that “more is better ” often prevails in quality management decisions, with very little consideration, if any, of cost. This paper suggests that such decisions should be driven by consideration of cost-benefit tradeoffs and profit maximization. It specifically addresses data-quality decisions which are relevant in the database marketing area: the time-span covered by and targeted quality levels within datasets. These decisions are routinely made based on satisfying technical and functional requirements. We propose a model that quantifies the benefits and costs associated with these decisions and helps maximize profit. The paper describes the model development, discusses it...|$|R

I intend to argue that due to the explosive growth of knowledge whose domain is “outside the head”, this conception has outlived its relevance. On the other hand, Karl Popper’s (1934) Falsificationism, with its emphasis on the objective character of knowledge, is not only a sounder, but also a more appropriate theory of knowledge for understanding the nature and growth of civilization. Later, Popper (1945) generalized this approach to obtain critical rationalism, in which all claims to knowledge, whether scientific or otherwise, are understood as objective solutions to objective problems and can be evaluated by other non-observational - types of criticism. I will first argue that Popper’s methodology is quite suited to the view that knowledge is an objective autonomous product and then adduce his theory of world 3, an ontology that neatly wraps up various considerations. World 3 is the domain of abstract products of the human mind that now have a life of their own, outside of human heads: theories, arguments, problems, plans, etc. I then adduce some other arguments for the autonomous quality of knowledge...|$|R
