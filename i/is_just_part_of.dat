25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that {{mathematics}} is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E

Lukáš Havlena {{contacted}} the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he [...] "didn't like {{the description of the}} situation" [...] by the previous witnesses. He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night, and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show. He also said that each time somebody got on the stage, Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there. Havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive, somebody aided his fall from behind. He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground. Havlena had trouble recalling details from the show, as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in Abaton, and thus could not describe, among other things, the position of the guardrail.|$|E

2500|$|Janet Carr told News.com.au, [...] "When {{we first}} started [...] we knew there was nothing out there in {{mainstream}} media that satisfied us as gamers, and so we made the show from within the community...

[...] News.com.au said, [...] "Good Game thrives from online interaction with its viewers, offering free episodes and even gaming sessions with the team", citing Carr's explanation: [...] "Our forums are incredibly active, we play games regularly with people who watch the show, and the emails they send are like, 'Hey Jungy (co-host Junglist), thanks for knifing me last night!'" [...] After spontaneously deciding to attend the EB Games Gold Coast conference, thinking the experience would be lonely and awkward, Hex and Bajo were overwhelmed by the response; the hundreds of people in queues to go see them. It was due to fan requests that Ask Good Game – an exclusive segment to Good Game: Spawn Point for some time – was added back to the parent show. In 2013, Bajo and Hex had an AMA with their fans on Reddit.|$|E
2500|$|However {{the work}} which has {{attracted}} {{the most attention}} and praise from critics in recent decades is {{what appears to be}} his [...] "only known landscape", View across Sandown Bay, Isle of Wight probably of 1855, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, who describe it as a [...] "minor masterpiece". [...] This small painting, which more closely approaches a Pre-Raphaelite landscape style, shows a half-harvested cornfield, with tools and jugs of the farm-workers piled up beside a corn stook. [...] But the only figures visible are two clearly middle-class women, no doubt part of the same party as the artist, one sitting against a stook reading a book, and the other walking with a parasol. [...] Any georgic or realist focus on agriculture is absent [...] "his cornfield <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a landscape where middle-class people take their leisure. [...] The corn is no more or no less useful than the beaches which we imagine to be in the distance of this brilliantly coloured painting". Here too a more subtle hint of religious feeling is found: [...] "the church in the distance hints at the source of the bounty represented by the partially garnered harvest in the foreground fields". [...] Treatments of the almost identical view by William Dyce and James Collinson (Mother and Child, Mellon Centre, Yale), both Burchett's colleagues at the school, are taken by Geoffrey Grigson to mean that the three artists were on a visit, or holiday, together. [...] Dyce, like Burchett, was an artist who saw himself as a history painter but is now most often remembered for a single Pre-Raphaelitish landscape, his Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858.|$|E
