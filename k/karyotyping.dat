40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{literature on}} the diversity of <b>karyotypes</b> in Allium is available, no attempt to analyse these data together, within a robust phylogenetic framework, {{has been carried out}} so far. Thus, we examined patterns and trends in chromosome evolution across the genus. Based on literature survey, karyo-morphometric features for 207 species belonging to 12 subgenera of Allium were obtained. Included in the data-set were basic chromosome number (x), somatic chromosome number (2 n), total haploid (monoploid) chromosome length (THL) and three different measures defining <b>karyotype</b> structure: CVCI, measuring how heterogeneous are centromeres positions in a <b>karyotype,</b> CVCL and MCA, quantifying interchromosomal and intrachromosomal <b>karyotype</b> asymmetry, respectively. Trends in <b>karyotype</b> evolution were analysed by phylogenetic regressions and independent contrasts. Mean <b>karyotypes</b> highlighted differences and similarities in <b>karyotype</b> structure between the 12 subgenera. Further differences were noted when the two parameters for analysing <b>karyotype</b> asymmetry were assessed. In addition, by examining the effects of increasing <b>karyotype</b> dimensions (a proxy for genome size) on <b>karyotype</b> structure and asymmetry, it was shown that in Allium species, the DNA was added proportionally to their arm lengths. Overall, p = 8 and somehow intermediate <b>karyotype</b> asymmetry levels seem to represent plesiomorphic characterstates in Allium...|$|R

25|$|Multicolor FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} <b>karyotyping</b> are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores.

Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral <b>karyotyping,</b> by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E
40|$|AbstractKaryotype {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by {{the characterization}} of chromosome morphology, based on the position of centromeres. Different <b>karyotypes</b> often reflect speciation events within phylogenies as they can establish crossing barriers between species. Hence, evolution of <b>karyotypes</b> often is congruent with splits and differentiation of clades within phylogenies of angiosperm genera. Here we study <b>karyotype</b> evolution in the big cosmopolitan genus Ranunculus and in related genera {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>karyotypes</b> are congruent with major clades. We investigated <b>karyotypes</b> on mitoses of 36 species, evaluated literature records for additional 87 species, and reconstructed ancestral states by mapping <b>karyotypes</b> onto a published molecular phylogenetic tree. Altogether ten <b>karyotypes</b> can be discriminated as character states, eight based on the base number x= 8, and two on the base number x= 7. The ancestral type within Ranunculus is characterized by four metacentric and four submetacentric/subtelocentric chromosomes, and dominates in five major basal clades of Ranunculus (R. subg. Auricomus) and in four of the related genera (Coptidium, Halerpestes, Kumlienia, and Trautvetteria). Another four <b>karyotypes</b> are ancestral and predominant in two major clades within Ranunculus (R. subg. Ranunculus), while three further ones occur only on terminal branches of the buttercup phylogeny. Among related genera, Ficaria and Ceratocephala also show derived <b>karyotypes.</b> <b>Karyotype</b> morphology thus supports generic and infrageneric classifications based on molecular and morphological data. <b>Karyotype</b> evolution drives in general to increasing number of chromosomes with asymmetric arms, and to a reduction from x= 8 to x= 7 chromosomes. A review of interspecific homoploid hybridization in sympatric species, and of crossing experiments suggests enhanced crossability of species with the same <b>karyotype</b> and strong crossing barriers between those with different <b>karyotypes.</b> We conclude that <b>karyotype</b> evolution is a major driver of speciation and differentiation of clades within Ranunculus...|$|R

25|$|Cyto{{genetics}} is {{a branch}} of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis.

25|$|The routine {{chromosome}} analysis (<b>Karyotyping)</b> refers to analysis of metaphase chromosomes {{which have been}} banded using trypsin followed by Giemsa, Leishmanns, or a mixture of the two.
