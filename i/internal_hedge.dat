We consider 26 countries, most of them small, with poorly-developed financial markets, and in which exchange rate fluctuations and political instability are relatively high. The main results are threefold.

Second, we find a significant positive impact of binding currency agreements in the form of euro or ERM II membership, mainly on the extensive margin of trade. Moreover, we show that being party to those agreements allows firms to engage in international trade with a lower degree of <b>internal</b> <b>hedging.</b> Third, we make the case that political stability is related to an increase in exports...|$|R

The investigation {{was based on the}} experienced practices in 2015. A web-based survey was used to source data from the population and yielded a 37 % response rate. Transactional risk is the most prioritised form of foreign exchange exposure. Surprisingly, economic exposure is also highly regarded by JSE non-financial firms. Translational risk is the least prioritised form of foreign exchange risk. There is a significant statistical relationship between the frequency at which firms manage economic risk, and the industry to which they belong. Consistent with the prescriptive theory, the study found that a significant majority of firms used <b>internal</b> or operational <b>hedging</b> techniques in combination with financial derivatives. Netting is the predominately used <b>internal</b> <b>hedging</b> technique by the survey respondents. There is a significant relationship between a firm's usage of netting as an <b>internal</b> <b>hedging</b> technique and the percentage of foreign currency denominated expenses. Forward contracts are the preferred financial derivative used to hedge foreign exchange exposure. The study reveals that the manner in which firms use forward contracts is significantly influenced by their percentage of foreign currency denominated expenses.

40|$|Foreign capital {{investment}} in microfinance has been booming {{over the past}} four years. Commercial cross-border debt and equity invested in microfinance surpassed US$ 11 billion in 2009, representing an estimated 20 percent of the funding base for specialized microfinance providers. 1 Foreign investment brings important benefits for microfinance institutions (MFIs). It can provide longer term debt maturity and risk capital that often is not available in the local market, but it can come with a significant string attached: foreign exchange risk. Seventy percent of cross-border, fixed-income investments are denominated in foreign currencies 2 (meaning currencies other than the currencies in which the MFIs are operating), leaving MFIs with significant foreign exchange exposure. 3 During the most recent global financial crisis, some MFIs that depend on foreign currency-denominated debt have suffered heavy foreign exchange losses that threaten their overall viability (Littlefield and Kneiding 2009). And local currency hedging needs for microfinance is estimated at US$ 1. 5 billion in 2009. 4 Managing foreign exchange risk has been a persistent challenge for microfinance donors and investors. Some have developed their own <b>internal</b> <b>hedging</b> systems to offer local currency loans, while others, like the Dutch public investor FMO, have sought to establish dedicated vehicles to hedge local currency investments for themselves and other international donors and investors.

40|$|Title: Corporate Strategies for Currency Risk Management ackground:Currency {{fluctuations}} are {{a global}} phenomenon, and can affect multinational companies directly through their cash flow, financial result and company valuation. The exposure to currency risks might however be covered against or ‘hedged’, {{as it is}} called, by different external and internal corporate strategies. However, some of these strategies might include a risk themselves {{as they can be}} expensive and uncertain. It is therefore an interesting question whether if these strategies are actually applied in practice, and if so which strategies are favored and why. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to present and explain the different external and <b>internal</b> <b>hedging</b> techniques and to see which, or if any, strategies are favored by large, medium-sized and small companies and for what reasons. Method: Regarding primary data, interviews with a mostly qualitative profile have been used to discuss the subject with respondents from six companies, diversified in size using the classification from the European Commission. Secondary data has been collected through literature from the university library and internet sources. Conclusion: Large companies primarily use the strategy of forwards, since they carry high elements of risk aversion, predictability and simplicity. For internal strategies, large companies prefer netting. Small companies extensively use matching because the routine is easy to establish and handle. Medium-sized companies can use either one so much depends on the risk-aversion and cash-flow management of the company. Large companies continuously regard currency risk a big factor, whereas small companies have just recently started due to the dollar depreciation. Translation exposure should be considered a big risk regardless of the company size, if the company is the main one in a corporate group. Finally, the subject of currency risk management is very theoretically broad, but its appliance in practice is very slim as only a few strategies are actually favored and frequently used...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} foreign {{exchange}} (forex) risk management {{have tended to}} focus on multinational enterprises; while how SMEs manage their forex risk is still largely unexplored. As small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly involved in international markets, they have become a new research setting on forex risk management. Given that SMEs have limited access to resources, skills and capabilities, <b>internal</b> <b>hedging</b> techniques could be favoured by SMEs. There is limited research on this matter, and the extant literature on forex management generally considers derivatives as major hedging techniques for large firms. This thesis primarily investigates how exporting SMEs manage forex risk. In addition, approaches to forex management could be changed as a firm becomes more experienced internationally. Following the basic principles of internationalisation theory, the thesis also examines the impact of the internationalisation degree of the firm on forex management decisions. This thesis sheds new light on SMEs’ hedging practices by providing a better understanding of SMEs’ choices of forex risk management. Three research questions have been raised: (1) what determinants influence SMEs’ choice to hedge as a way of managing forex risk; (2) what strategies do SMEs use when they choose hedging to manage forex exposure; and (3) how does the degree of internationalisation impact the choice of forex management. The thesis draws on two theoretical perspectives to help address these overarching questions. It extends the use of the resource-based view (RBV), and combines this with internationalisation theory. The setting of SMEs is a context for using the RBV. New Zealand and Australian exporting SMEs provide the sample for testing the hypotheses. The contributions of this thesis are twofold. Firstly, the thesis identifies four determinants of forex risk strategy by exporting SMEs, i. e. degree of internationalisation (specifically, export ratio), forex exposure, perceived forex risk, and resources. Secondly, it extends the use of the RBV and the internationalisation theory in forex risk management of SMEs. In addition, the thesis uses a research approach combining an exploratory qualitative study and a main quantitative study...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} scholarly analysis of the <b>internal</b> governance of <b>hedge</b> funds. Hedge fund governance consists of the structures and practices that hedge funds adopt in response to lacking permanent capital {{and in order to}} reduce agency costs. Hedge fund governance is important because better governance can improve investor returns and help managers raise and retain capital. I argue that hedge fund governance is best understood as a type of responsive managerialism. It is a type of managerialism because applicable law and contracting structures give managers nearly unchecked internal control over the fund and its operations. Hedge fund governance is also uniquely responsive, however, because managers must continually satisfy investors due to their ability to shut down a fund by withdrawing their capital. Overall, I find that hedge fund governance devices keep agency costs low such that hedge fund investors are not being systematically ripped-off by managers. Nonetheless, there is still plenty of room for hedge fund governance to improve. Accordingly, this Article provides a normative framework for parties to improve hedge fund governance by striking a better balance between governance devices that are investor-friendly and those that empower managers to achieve higher risk-adjusted returns. My analysis suggests that the areas in which hedge fund governance needs the most improvement are performance reporting and the timing of performance-fee calculations. Surprisingly, my analysis also suggests that investors are often better off with less transparency, higher fees, and less access to their capital...|$|R

The full sample consists of 50 of the world’s largest airlines based on market capitalisation which is made up of 11 airlines from the United States and 39 {{from the rest of the}} world. Data was collected over a period of 14 years from 2002 – 2015. The study used a number of tests including univariate and multivariate tests. These showed that liquidity was a key determinant on whether or not a firm hedged, which therefore offers support to the theory that a lack of <b>internal</b> funds creates <b>hedging</b> incentives. Another key determinant was the size of the airline, which also offered support to the notion that larger firms are more likely to hedge to take advantage of their economies of scale. The interest coverage measure produced mixed results whereby it was an important determinant for non-U. S. airlines’ decision to hedge, however it was insignificant for U. S. airlines. One of the explanations for this may be the Chapter 11 bankruptcy provision that provides bankrupt U. S. firms with a huge competitive advantage over their international competitors, who are based in countries with credit-favouring bankruptcy codes. The inability of non-U.

40|$|The Northern Ireland {{landscape}} was stratified random sampled by 288 25 ha squares, within which hedges and other field boundaries were mapped and surveyed to estimate extent and change between 1998 and 2007. The woody species composition in a 30 m length of each hedge was also recorded {{to determine the}} ecological structure of the hedges and to monitor change. The species composition of hedges was assessed against variables describing the physical environment, landscape structure and land use history. Hedges have an estimated length of 113648 km, {{the result of a}} net decrease of - 4. 6 % between 1998 and 2007, as losses (mainly due to building construction or field enlargement, and hedges subsumed within woodland planting or scrub habitat development), exceeded gains (mainly due to hedge creation by management or planting). These hedge transitions also affected the mean number of woody species per 30 m which decreased slightly to 4. 73. Hedges with higher woody species diversity are: town land boundaries; in smaller townlands with a higher perimeter-area ratio; sinuous in shape; at lower elevation; closer to ancient woodland and to raths; on soil groups classified as moderate to poor quality agricultural land; and have associated species-rich herbaceous ground layers, wet ditches or earth banks. Hedges with lower diversity are: closer to buildings; more intensively managed (flat-topped); on better quality agricultural land. No significant difference in road-side and <b>internal</b> field boundary <b>hedge</b> diversity was found. Native woody species are associated with variables related to higher diversity, e. g. hazel (Gory/us avellana) is more frequent in townland boundary hedges. The opposite is the case for non-native species. These occur in 30 % of hedge 30 m lengths and in ca. 90 % of sites with hedges, indicating a potential for further expansion. The research highlights the interconnectedness of ecological and historical variables and related landscape metrics which affect patterns of hedge woody species diversity in agricultural landscapes. This has important implications for landscape-level management and planning policies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Even {{if there}} is no uniform and legal {{definition}} of the term “hedge fund”, it is generally agreed amongst securities regulators that all hedge funds have potentially common characteristics: no self imposed rules in terms of diversification of assets, unlimited use of derivatives and of complex financial techniques, intensive use of leveraging and substantial performance commissions, and shares not frequently redeemable by the investors. At the international level, hedge funds cannot be considered any longer as a « black hole » in the financial sphere given the growing number of regulatory authorities that have already implemented supervisory systems in relation to such funds. It is obvious though that much remains to be done in this ever changing area, which is all the more complex to regulate that it today is the object of prejudice that can sometimes generate confusion. Hedge funds’ “shareholder activism” is both criticized and hailed as a mechanism creating value. Their risk-taking approach generates concerns as to financial stability and can nevertheless supply welcome liquidity to the markets. The transparency of their operations is considered as being insuffi cient, whereas their strategies make them truly successful with an increasing number of investors. The clarification of the specific risks attached to hedge funds’ activity is therefore a prerequisite to defining the regulators’ priorities for action. The AMF has identifi ed five main areas that may need further initiatives at the international level: • the systemic risk due to the potential failure of a large-size hedge fund or a chain of several smaller hedge funds leads to consider improvements of the investors’ credit risk assessment on hedge funds by, for example, urging hedge funds’ rating; • the risk of market abuse calls for ways to enhance the transparency of the hedge funds’ activities on OTC markets; • the risk for the governance of listed companies and of misbehaviour put into question certain practices such as stock lending at shareholders’ meetings; • the operational risk of incorrect valuation of illiquid or complex assets has pushed IOSCO to take initiatives on the valuation process and <b>internal</b> controls of <b>hedge</b> funds; • the risk of misselling to insufficiently informed investors requests new domestic and international standards before any further retail exposure to alternative products. ...|$|R
40|$|Firms {{exporting}} {{their goods}} and services abroad face risks that {{are different from the}} risks faced by firms who do not engage in international trade. It is common practice to allow the receiving party to pay in instalments. The exporting firm faces credit risk, but as in most countries, Dutch firms can insure such risks. To some extent, such export credit risks can be insured on the private market. There are private insurance companies that insure short-term risks. On the Dutch market, Gerling NCM, Coface, and Euler-Cobac operate as insurers. The Dutch government acts as reinsurer of long-term export credit risks (three years or more). A reinsurance agreement exists with Gerling NCM for this purpose. Short-term and medium-term contracts can be reinsured in the private reinsurance market. In almost all OECD countries export credits are officially supported. This can take the form of direct finance (e. g. US, Canada) or the government can insure the export credit risks (directly as for example in the United Kingdom or indirectly by reinsuring a private insurer such as in the Netherlands). The role of this government-backed insurance on exports to certain countries is important as experience has shown that the private market is very reluctant to cover long term export risks to non-OECD countries. Considering the government involvement in this market, one can raise the following questions: 1. What are the key determinants of export credit risk insurability by the private market? 2. Which export credit risks can be covered by the private market? In the report, an answer to these questions is provided by means of a literature review and an extensive field study, with special emphasis {{on the role of the}} Dutch government as a reinsurer of export credit risks. The main conclusions are as follows. Economic theory predicts that firms that operate risk averse are willing to pay an insurance premium. Large (say listed) firms operate at a relative low degree of risk aversion. These firms can use <b>internal</b> risk <b>hedging</b> as a useful alternative to private export credit risk insurance. Medium-sized firms are more likely to apply for export credit risk insurance, while small firms probably face problems (since for this group there is only one supplier of insurance active in the Dutch market). Small firms do not have the knowledge to hedge export risks differently than by export credit insurance in the Netherlands. They lack the resources and knowledge to have access to the international insurance markets. Moreover, the duration of the coverage is often not as long as exporting companies would like (this is experienced by both large and small companies). This is partly due to reinsurance restrictions faced by the insurance companies. A related problem to insurability is the high market concentration of supply. Market dominance leads to monopolistic rent extraction. In the case of the Netherlands this might apply to Gerling NCM. On the other hand relationship insurance seems to be a popular model. In our field study, firms point at a preference for long-lasting relations. Most exporters seem to have low price elasticity of insurance demand. Economic theory predicts moral hazard to be an important determinant of insurability. The issue of moral hazard, though recognized by insurance companies, does not dominate the perception of insurability. The price of export credit insurance is largely determined by macroeconomic risk factors, such as political risk. This leads us to the second main issue: what role should the government play on the market for export credit risk insurance and which risks should be covered by the governement? We argue the following: ? In markets with asymmetric information it is likely that profitable projects will be denied insurance. If the government considers export growth as one of its main goals, it should interfere in the market by lowering relative prices; ? The government is equipped to hedge intertemporal risks due to a low social cost of capital. In our field study some market participants point at the responsibility the government should take, especially in the case of small exporting companies; ? The government should offer opportunities to hedge macroeconomic risks, such as political/country risk. These risk types are seen as the main drivers of export insurance premium contracts; ? Moral hazard of public (re-) insurance might be a problem, but is not perceived as such in our field study by (re) insurance companies operating in the private market. The relation between the Dutch government and Gerling NCM is different, though. Gerling NCM retains no risk on its public account, and the government cannot end its relation with Gerling NCM. Therefore, moral hazard could be a problem in this insurer/reinsurer relation; ? Besides direct interference, the government should take care of prudential regulation of the insurance sector. Monopolistic behaviour should be avoided by appropriate regulation. Especially contracts that have a large geographical nature are subject to at least monopolistic competition. Clients who are not satisfied with the monopoly supplier should be able to meet other suppliers (at home or abroad). This holds especially for long-term contracts. In all cases the government should operate in a prudential way. No involvement may prevent profitable projects from being insured, too much involvement may crowd out the market for private export credit risk insurance. Finally, based on the research, we recommend the following. ? It seems that the industrial organization of the market for export credit risks insurance is an important issue. Some firms that were interviewed mentioned the large number of alternatives in the London market. This reinforces the idea of increasing competition in the Netherlands. ?
