5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and <b>Estonia,</b> {{although they were}} given only eight hours to respond. With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or <b>Estonia</b> was even more futile. All three states were occupied and lost their independence.|$|E
5|$|All former {{republics of}} the Soviet Union, which were {{geographically}} situated in Europe, would later compete in the contest on their own in the 1990s and 2000s: Russia, <b>Estonia,</b> Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, except Kazakhstan, with four of the countries going on to win one of the contests: <b>Estonia,</b> Latvia, Russia, and Azerbaijan. Ukraine was the first ex-USSR country to win twice.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{from the}} 14th century, parts of <b>Estonia’s</b> northwestern coast and islands were colonized by ethnic Swedes, {{who later became}} known as the Estonian Swedes.

5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would be deployed on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in <b>Estonia</b> with some also being deployed to Poland. This British deployment forms part of a four-battle group (four-battalion) deployment by various allies, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, one each spread from Poland (the Poland-deployed battle group mostly led by the U.S.) to <b>Estonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with <b>Estonia</b> did not exclude the Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. <b>Estonia</b> also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|The Learned Estonian Society (Õpetatud Eesti Selts, Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft, {{shortened}} ÕES) is <b>Estonia's</b> oldest scholarly organisation, and {{was formed}} at the University of Tartu in 1838. Its charter was to study <b>Estonia's</b> history and pre-history, its language, literature and folklore.|$|R
50|$|The Estonian War of Independence (1918-1920), {{which took}} place during the Russian Civil War, was the Republic of <b>Estonia's</b> {{struggle}} for sovereignty in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917. The war ended in 1920 with <b>Estonia's</b> victory over Russia.|$|R

The largest European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is (32 m) tall and 2.2 m in circumference. The park contains allees of oak, horse chestnut, and maple.

5|$|For {{their first}} World Cup {{qualifying}} campaign, Andorra were drawn {{in a group}} with Cyprus, <b>Estonia,</b> Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal. They lost their opening match 1–0 to <b>Estonia.</b> In the next game, they lost 3–2 to Cyprus but scored their first World Cup qualifying goals. They were again defeated by <b>Estonia,</b> this time 2–1. They lost all their matches and their only away goal was in a 3–1 loss against Ireland. Their worst defeat was 7–1 to Portugal on a neutral ground in Lleida, Spain. Andorra finished the campaign with no points and conceded 36 goals in ten matches.|$|E
5|$|From 1918–1940, when <b>Estonia</b> was independent, {{the small}} Swedish {{community}} was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden {{before the end}} of World War II, that is, before the invasion of <b>Estonia</b> by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and <b>Estonia,</b> {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934. Its {{principal}} purposes were coordination of joint {{foreign policy and}} mutual international diplomatic support; {{it was not a}} military alliance. In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside the scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade <b>Estonia</b> to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{offensive}} commenced {{with the}} Soviet 2nd Shock Army breaching the defence of the II Army Corps along the Emajõgi River {{in the vicinity}} of Tartu. The defenders managed to slow the Soviet advance sufficient for Army Detachment Narwa to be evacuated from mainland <b>Estonia</b> in an orderly fashion. On 18 September, the constitutional Government of <b>Estonia</b> captured the government buildings in Tallinn from the Germans and the city was abandoned by the German forces by 22 September. The Leningrad Front seized the capital and took the rest of mainland <b>Estonia</b> by 26 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The exit of Finland {{from the}} war on 3 September {{provided}} the political impetus for abandoning <b>Estonia.</b> The next day, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested {{that it would not}} be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation, codenamed Königsberg, to be drawn up. Hitler, however, declared that Ostland must not be given up at any cost, since doing so would provide support to those Finns that did not favour the new course of the government, and would influence Sweden to maintain its current foreign policy. After lunch, Guderian ordered that the Königsberg plan nevertheless be secretly initiated. On the next day, Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation. On 11 September, the evacuation of <b>Estonia</b> was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length. On 15 September, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner, requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of <b>Estonia,</b> codenamed Operation Aster. Schörner emphasised that although the front was still holding, delaying the order would mean the units in <b>Estonia</b> would be trapped. Hitler agreed on 16 September.|$|E

5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} <b>Estonia</b> as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from <b>Estonia</b> and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in <b>Estonia</b> retreated, Finland {{would be forced to}} make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on their own terms.|$|E
