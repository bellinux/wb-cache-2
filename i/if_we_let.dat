25|$|The {{extension}} property makes β a functor from Top (the {{category of}} topological spaces) to CHaus (the category of compact Hausdorff spaces). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>let</b> U be the inclusion functor from CHaus into Top, maps from βX to K (for K in CHaus) correspond bijectively to maps from X to UK (by considering their restriction to X {{and using the}} universal property of βX). i.e. Hom(βX, K) = Hom(X, UK), which means that β is left adjoint to U. This implies that CHaus is a reflective subcategory of Top with reflector β.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>let</b> ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

2500|$|The root {{discriminant}} of {{a number}} field, K, of degree n, often denoted rdK, {{is defined as the}} n-th root of the absolute value of the (absolute) discriminant of K. The relation between relative discriminants in a tower of fields shows that the root discriminant does not change in an unramified extension. [...] The existence of a class field tower provides bounds on the root discriminant: the existence of an infinite class field tower over Q(√-m) where m = 3·5·7·11·19 shows that there are infinitely many fields with root discriminant 2√m ≈ 296.276.

2500|$|The {{situation}} can be profitably {{compared to that}} which arises {{in the search for}} functions on the projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v≠0 in V and satisfy the equation F(cv)=F(v) for all non-zero c. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let F be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv)=c'k'F(v). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree [...] On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for eachk, and on the other, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>let</b> k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective spaceP(V).|$|E
2500|$|When Roosevelt {{began his}} {{run for a}} second term in May 1930, he reiterated his {{doctrine}} from the campaign two years before: [...] "that progressive government by its very terms, must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never ending and that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>let</b> up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization." [...] He ran on a platform that called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. His Republican opponent could not overcome the public's criticism of the Republican Party during the economic downturn, and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of 14%. With the Hoover administration resisting proposals to directly address the economic crisis, Governor Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted well over one third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.|$|E
