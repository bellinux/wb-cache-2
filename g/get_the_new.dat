500|$|The BJP's origins {{lie in the}} Bharatiya Jana Sangh, {{popularly known}} as the Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee in 1951 in {{response}} to the politics of the dominant Congress party. It was founded in collaboration with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS. The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's [...] "Hindu" [...] cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks, or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> party off the ground. Prominent among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952.

500|$|The {{magazine}} was initially bimonthly. The first three issues were named with two months: [...] "JuneJuly 1953", and so on. At {{the end of}} 1953 the naming was changed to the odd numbered months; and then after January, March, May, and July, the magazine went monthly, starting with the September 1954 issue. This lasted without a break until the November 1958 issue. Another bimonthly schedule, starting with January 1959, followed; the last King-Size Publications issue was September 1959, and {{it was followed by}} an October 1959 issue from Great American.

500|$|... "Headline News" [...] was {{released}} on September 26, 1994, as the lead-off single for Permanent Record: Al in the Box, which was also released a day later. Yankovic also insisted that the song be commercially available as a CD single so that his fans who are completists {{would not have to}} purchase the expensive box set just to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> song. Much like the cover for the Crash Test Dummies's 1993 studio album God Shuffled His Feet, the cover for Yankovic's single superimposes his faces over the figures of Titian's painting Bacchus and Ariadne. The art direction is credited to Doug Haverty, and design is credit to Daniel Sorenson, David McDougall. The b-side of [...] "Headline News" [...] was a remix of Yankovic's 1986 original song [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song was never officially released on a studio album, although it did appear on Yankovic's Greatest Hits Volume II album, which {{was released}} a month later on October 25, 1994. The single charted and peaked at number four on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which corresponds to a position of 104 on the Billboard Hot 100. This made it Yankovic's first domestically charting single since 1992's [...] "Smells Like Nirvana".|$|E
500|$|When The New York Times began {{publishing}} its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His {{words to}} National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included [...] "People have gotta {{be put to}} the torch for this sort of thing..." [...] and [...] "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail." [...] After failing to <b>get</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.|$|E
