6000|$|That {{is perhaps}} {{the first and the}} last time that Dickens ever touched the extreme dignity of pathos. He is {{restraining}} his compassion, and afterwards he let it go. Now laughter is a thing that can be let go; laughter has in <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> liberty. But sorrow has in it by its very nature a quality of confinement; pathos by its very nature fights with itself. Humour is expansive; it bursts outwards; the fact is attested by the common expression, [...] "holding one's sides." [...] But sorrow is not expansive; and it was afterwards the mistake of Dickens that he tried to make it expansive. It is the one great weakness of Dickens as a great writer, that he did try to make that sudden sadness, that abrupt pity, which we call pathos, a thing quite obvious, infectious, public, as if it were journalism or the measles. It is pleasant to think that in this supreme masterpiece, done in the dawn of his career, there is not even this faint fleck upon the sun of his just splendour. Pickwick will always be remembered as the great example of everything that made Dickens great; of the solemn conviviality of great friendships, of the erratic adventures of old English roads, of the hospitality of old English inns, of the great fundamental kindliness and honour of old English manners. First of all, however, it will always be remembered for its laughter, or, if you will, for its folly. A good joke is the one ultimate and sacred thing which cannot be criticised. Our relations with a good joke are direct and even divine relations. We speak of [...] "seeing" [...] a joke just as we speak of [...] "seeing" [...] a ghost or a vision. If we have seen it, it is futile to argue with us; and we have seen the vision of Pickwick. Pickwick may be the top of Dickens's humour; I think upon the whole it is. But the broad humour of Pickwick he broadened over many wonderful kingdoms; the narrow pathos of Pickwick he never found again.|$|E

But the great thing is that it's really a pity you are not here {{for participation in the}} fine old English thrill and throb of all that goes forward simply from day to day and that makes the common texture of our life: you would generously abound in the sense of it, I feel, and be grateful for {{it as a kind of}} invaluable, a really cherishable, [...] "race" [...] experience. One wouldn't have to explain anything to you--you would take it all down in a gulp, the kind of gulp in which one has to indulge to keep from breaking down under the positive pang of comprehension and emotion. Two afternoons ago I caught that gulp, twice over, in the very act--while listening to that dear and affable Emile Boutroux make an exquisite philosophic address to the British Academy, which he had come over for the purpose of, and then hearing the less consummate, yet sturdily sensitive and expressive Lord Chancellor (Haldane) utter to him, in return, the thanks of the select and intense auditory and their sense of the beautiful and wonderful and unprecedented unison of nations that the occasion symbolised and celebrated. In the quietest way in the world Boutroux just escaped [...] "breaking down" [...] in his preliminary reference to what this meant and how he felt, and just so the good Haldane grazed the same almost inevitable accident in speaking for us, all us present and the whole public consciousness, when he addressed the lecturer afterwards. What was so moving was its being so utterly unrehearsed and immediate--its coming, on one side and the other, so of itself, and being a sort of thing that hasn't since God knows when, if ever, found itself taking place between nation and nation. I kind of wish that the U.S.A. were not (though of necessity, I admit) so absent from this feast of friendship; it figures for me as such an extraordinary luxury that the whirligig of time has turned up for us such an intimacy of association with France and that France so exquisitely responds to it. I quite tasted of the quality of this last fact two nights ago when an English officer, a most sane and acute middle-aged Colonel, dined with me and another friend, and gave us a real vision of what the presence of the British forces in the field now means for the so extraordinarily intelligent and responsive French, and what a really unprecedented relation (I do wish to goodness we were in it!) between a pair of fraternising and reciprocating people it represents.

Hence in this paper we hold it that the reader`s involvement in the interpretation of the novel eventually entails the decoding of the corpus for the externalisation of the literary substance. A reader who is fully involved in the interpretation and processing of implied meaning(s) in the novel, digs into its semantic structure by condation and deduction and comes out with more lasting impressions than he would if he were to deal with a less subtle or totally explicit idiom that may be regarded as plain and spoon-feeding...|$|E

In Leroi-Gourhan's account's of palaeolithic art, projection {{plays a key role in}} the definition of hands as petroglyphs. Gorky's memoir of the first film screenings in Russia speaks of 'the land of shadows'. Projection is the medium of perspective in all its forms, and of cartography. In these later, more rigourously abstract and mathematical forms, projection reveals one of its key qualities: anamorphosis. On the one hand then, projection is the most direct record that previous ages had of light? a function it had in the art of the silhouette, for example. But at the same time, the projection of three dimensional objects like the globe onto two dimensional planes like maps meant that all projection was also distortion. The evidence of presence is always open to the anamorphic vision so integral to cinemascope and other photographic technologies. By looking at some examples of the use of projection in contemporary art, I want to contest the hegemony of the four-square, flat projection and its pretence at the cinematic, and to ask whether the field of projected light has more to offer than the emulation of the real. Is projection, after all, a kind of psychological fantasy?

40|$|The {{photograph}} {{is the only}} picture that can truly convey information, {{even if it is}} technically faulty and the object can barely be identified. A painting of a murder is of no interest whatever; but a photograph of a murder fascinates everyone. — Gerhard Richter, quoted in [Obrist, 1995], 56 – 57. Many have held that photographs give us a firmer epistemic connection to the world than do other depictive representations. To take just one example, Bazin famously claimed that “The objective nature of photography confers on <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> credibility absent from all other picture-making ” ([Bazin, 1967], 14). Unfortunately, while the intuition in question is widely shared, it has remained poorly understood. In this paper we propose to explain the special epistemic status of photographs. We take as our starting place (in § 1) Kendall Walton’s startling proposal that photographs are special because they are “transparent” [Walton, 1984] — that is, that they are special because, unlike other depictive representations, they enable us literally to see their depicta. 1 Walton’s proposal has not convinced many; however, it has proven surprisingly difficult to say just what is wrong about the transparency thesis. In §§ 2 – 4 we’ll rise to this challenge and show why photographs are not transparent in Walton’s sense. Finally, in §§ 5 – 7 we’ll propose and defend a novel diagnosis of what is epistemically special about photographs. 1 Transparency and Photographs In saying that photographs are transparent, Walton means that visually attending to a photograph enables us to see something numerically distinct from that ∗Some of the material in this paper appeared (in an earlier version) in a shorter paper entitled “Photographs are Not Transparent ” that we presented at the 2003 Pacific Division meeting of the American Society for Aesthetics.

If {{we travel}} back to ancient times and {{turn out the}} golden pages of the Iliad and the Odyssey, or the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, we can make out that an epic is a long {{narrative}} in verse, written in an elevated style about an elevated theme, about a hero of unbelievable stature, who is either god, demigod or at least protected by a god and takes up a journey to fight against evil. It involves supernatural forces and action and adventure is on a large scale. Moby Dick by Herman Melville has generally been regarded as a book having several qualities of an epic. Although it cannot be called as an epic in strict sense because all the great epics have been written in verse and Moby Dick is in prose. Captain Ahab is not of any grand stature nor is he any god or demigod, in fact many scholars call him antichrist and atheist as he says "Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me " (127). He {{is a man who}} "looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness [...] " (118) Ahab’s high broad form, we are told, is made up of solid bronze and is shaped in an unalterable mould. Although Ahab is a common American man yet nothing about him is ordinary, when Melville describes his little ivory stool, he attributes to <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> grandeur.

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} {{recording}} and evaluating {{the quality of}} life of the patients suffering from anxiety disorders who are under outpatients' care in Vimperk region. These disorders are called neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders. They are frequent psychiatric disorders which are becoming greater in number due to the changes in lifestyle. There are frequently chronic disorders involved which mean a long-term harassment for the patient. What is of great importance is the appropriate treatment and the way the patient and the people around them approach the disorder. The main goal of the treatment is not relieving the troubles only, but also supporting the patient to be able to manage them, to be independent and to be able to join the society's life. The above mentioned disorders represent a considerable limitation of man's life, thus influencing its quality. It is a very serious fact, and therefore I have focused my attention on <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life can be characterized as an individual's subjective look upon the individual sides of his life. The most important factors influencing the quality of life include the state of health, family background, enough money an appropriate job, the development of social contacts and possibilities of further education and spending one's free time in a reasonable way. The quality of life can be looked upon as a fairly individual idea. There are values involved which are different for everyone and undergo changes during one's lifetime. The bachelor's thesis consists of two basic parts, a theoretical and a research one. In the theoretical part I have borrowed facts from specialized literature where there is a description of the individual anxiety disorders and their treatment to be found. In the next chapter I have dealt with the problem of the quality of life and possibilities of how one can look upon this term. The second part of the thesis involves a research study" processed on the basis of the data analysis which have been gained by way of questionnaires and dialogues. The research of the patients' quality of life was carried out through the SEIQoL-Method, moreover, the respondents were presented a uestionnaire which was specifically arranged so that the research questions might have been answered. There was a total of 100 patients' data gained and analysed within the scope of the psychiatric outpatients' department in Vimperk. Further on there were two research questions specified: 1. Whether the clients of the psychiatric outpatients' department have the impression of being stigmatized within the society and 2. Whether and which way {{the quality of life of}} the research sample had improved in comparision with the beginning of the treatment. The patients were chosen accidentally, they were clients of the outpatients' department suffering from anxiety disorders who appeared in the period of January until March for a control check-up and agreed with the research to be carried out.

40|$|Historical evidences {{suggest that}} human beings have been always in search of God in some form. Some believe that man is born with this divine sense. This {{ubiquitous}} quality of human beings is called primordial nature (fitrah). Many scholars have tried to demonstrate the existence of God through this shared quality of human individuals. In Islamic thought this latter intellectual effort has been designated as "argument from primordial nature" and in western theological and philosophical thought it is known as "argument from general consensus". Although these arguments have some differences in their general settings and attitudes; but they both resort to human general divine attitude to demonstrate the existence of God. In this essay we have sought to propound the views of those scholars who have dealt with this argument at length. Reflecting on the general form of the expositions shows that the expositions of argument from primordial nature and argument from general consensus cannot demonstrate the existence of God without basing themselves {{on the principle of}} causation or human existential poverty. Via comparative assessment of these two arguments we have turned to the critiques which have been leveled against them and laid bare their similarities and differences. Of course there are some differences between the argument from primordial nature in Islam and the argument from general consensus in west. This essay seeks to assay the key expositions which have been offered of these arguments in Islamic and western philosophies. It seems that among Moslem philosophers, Mulla Sadra from the early generation, Allameh Tabtabaei, Imam Khomeini, Jawadi Amuli and Mutahari from later generation, have paid more attention to this argument. Among western scholars one can mention William James, Charles Hodge, James Joyce, Paul Tillich and Seneca who have made more direct remarks on this argument. John Locke is also against this argument. This is why we have devoted this essay to the key views developed regarding these arguments.    When we put together different expositions of the argument from primordial nature and the argument from general consensus we reach to a general principle which constitutes the foundation of both arguments; i. e. the existence of a common sense in all human individuals in all times and places. To put it differently, both argument are founded on {{the idea that there is}} an inborn disposition in man which pushes him/her toward the Supreme and this disposition has existed in all times and places. But when we analyze the theories one by one we become aware of the slightest differences and similarities.    It seems that the second type biological expositions are nearer to the exposition of argument from primordial nature based on correlation. We mean those expositions which regard the generality of belief in God an indication of a primordial disposition toward God. The first type of expositions which interpret the enthusiasm for God in terms of instinctual needs cannot be an indication of primordial nature; since primordial nature is an exclusive faculty of humanity. Of course it is also noteworthy that the primordial nature to which the argument from the general consensus refers is a potentiality which needs to be actualized while Islamic thought suggests that primordial nature exists in all human individuals in a fulfilled form even if it is neglected now and then.    As to anti-skepticistic expositions we have to say that this exposition has one premise to the effect that all human beings who believe in God have accepted his existence in a rational way; particularly James Joyce who is the main proponent of this exposition believes that all human beings are open to their creator due to the decisive and clear call of reason. Thus it seems that this exposition of the argument from general consensus is similar to the third form of the argument from primordial nature; since in both the infallibility of human inner sense has been taken into account; though this infallibility is attributed to primordial nature in Islamic argument but Joyce regards <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> human reason as such. Then it remains to be asked that if primordial nature as understood in Islam is the same thing Joyce calls it reason? It is not definitely so as primordial nature in Islamic thought is envisaged as an exclusive quality of human being which is divine, fulfilled and inborn; but reason despite its inhabitance in human inside has to search the inside and outside for God. In other words, reason is a means with which one searches for Divine Essence; but primordial nature is an expression of human existential need; and being an inner call it invites the man toward God; primordial nature works through intuition and presential knowledge while reason bases itself on intellection, research and reflection...|$|E
