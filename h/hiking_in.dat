5|$|Within {{the living}} quarters, the {{atmosphere}} resembled {{that of a}} college dormitory. Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days {{because of the need}} to fly tapes from California, and most workers had to develop their own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went <b>hiking.</b> <b>In</b> general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E

5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, Mauritius and Réunion were placed under {{a state of}} alert. Residents in Réunion were advised to stay up to date with the latest {{warnings}} on the storm, not go <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> the mountains, ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked, {{stay away from the}} shore, and know the locations of the nearest shelters. Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore Mauritius before passing directly over Réunion, just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on Mauritius while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on Réunion.

Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer <b>hiking</b> <b>in</b> some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E
