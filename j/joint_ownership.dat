25|$|Another {{application}} of strong reciprocity is in allocating {{property rights and}} ownership structure. <b>Joint</b> <b>ownership</b> of property can be {{very similar to the}} public goods game, where owners can independently contribute to the common pool, which then returns on the investment and is evenly distributed to all parties. This ownership structure is subject to the tragedy of the commons, in which if all the parties are self-interested, no one will invest. Alternatively, property could be allocated in an owner and employee relationship, in which an employee is hired by the owner and paid a specific wage for a specific level of investment. Experimental studies show that participants generally prefer <b>joint</b> <b>ownership,</b> and do better under <b>joint</b> <b>ownership</b> than in the owner employee organization.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} distributing the proceeds generated from a joint venture in which the participating agents are hierarchically organized. We introduce and characterize a family of allocation rules where revenue ‘bubbles up’ in the hierarchy. The family is flexible enough to accommodate a no-transfer rule (where no revenue bubbles up) and a full-transfer rule (where all the revenues bubble {{up to the top}} of the hierarchy). Intermediate rules within the family are reminiscent of popular incentive mechanisms for social mobilization. Our benchmark model refers to the case of linear hierarchies, but we also extend the analysis to the case in which hierarchies may convey a general tree structure and include <b>joint</b> <b>ownerships...</b>|$|R

25|$|Joint authorship of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no <b>joint</b> <b>ownership</b> if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.
