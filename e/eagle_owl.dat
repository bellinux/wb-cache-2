5|$|Natural predators of the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{include the}} barn owl, the tawny owl, the northern goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl,</b> the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian <b>eagle</b> <b>owl,</b> the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> and four eagle species.|$|E
50|$|The species' main predators are <b>eagles,</b> <b>owls,</b> larger lizards, snakes, dingoes and quolls.|$|R

5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion of}} birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> or northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl.</b> They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian <b>eagle</b> <b>owl.</b> When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E

5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an <b>eagle</b> <b>owl,</b> but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5|$|Zorro {{is a young}} Whiskers {{male who}} in the first episode of the fourth series left his group, along with four of his {{brothers}} and Zaphod, to rove. They initially join the Aztecs with Zaphod, but eventually left again to continue roving. In the fifth episode of the series, they encounter the Commandoes. Nikita and her nearly all female group initially rebuff the group, but after an <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> causes a group panic, Zorro and his brothers are {{able to use the}} distraction to initiate a takeover bid. Nikita accepts Zorro's scent marking her and he becomes the Commandoes' new dominant male. Later in the series, when one of Zorro's brothers, Miles, continues attempting to get close to Nikita, Zorro viciously attacks him and exiles him. This is the first known male exile in the manor. To acknowledge Zorro's leadership, he is fitted with a radio collar. Three episodes later, Zorro's collar is found in a tree, and he is believed to be dead, presumed killed by a bird of prey.|$|E
25|$|The fennec fox's main predators are {{the various}} African {{varieties}} of <b>eagle</b> <b>owl.</b> Other possible predators include caracals, jackals, striped hyenas, and the saluki, a greyhound-like domestic dog local to the area. However, fennec foxes are considered {{very difficult to}} capture, and reports of predators other than the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> {{are considered to be}} anecdotal and questionable.|$|E

40|$|Fragments from lead {{ammunition}} pose a poisoning {{risk for}} predators like golden eagles that scavenge on non-retrieved carcasses or offal {{left behind by}} hunters. Three golden eagles {{were found in the}} Swiss Alps with an acute lead poisoning. To investigate whether the few cases of lead-poisoned golden eagles are exceptional events or whether a substantial proportion of the Alpine golden eagle population is affected by lead at sublethal levels, we measured body burdens in golden eagles from Switzerland in comparison to <b>eagle</b> <b>owls</b> from the same area and to their respective prey. These two raptor species differ in their food as <b>eagle</b> <b>owls</b> feed on live-caught prey. Lead levels in soft tissues were significantly higher in golden eagles (median 1. 14 μg g− 1 dry weight in liver, 0. 99 μg g− 1 in kidney) than in <b>eagle</b> <b>owls</b> (0. 14 and 0. 23 μg g− 1). Bones of golden eagles contained 10 times more lead (median of 12. 45 μg g− 1 dry weight) than owl bones (1. 28 μg g− 1), which represent substantially higher levels than previously reported for golden eagles. Bones of prey of both golden <b>eagles</b> and <b>eagle</b> <b>owls</b> had low lead concentrations. In order to investigate whether the sublethal lead of golden eagles originates from ammunition or from generic environmental contamination, we examined lead isotope ratios. Lead isotope signatures of golden eagle bones were very similar to those of ammunition, but differed from the signatures of bones of their prey, <b>eagle</b> <b>owls</b> and soil. Isotope signatures did not change with increasing bone lead concentration in golden eagles or any other group examined. These findings indicate that in the Alps, most golden eagles take up lead from spent ammunition in carcasses or their offal in sublethal quantities throughout their life and a few in lethal quantities leading to acute lead poisoning...|$|R

25|$|Owls are not {{closely related}} to hawks or falcons. There is little written in classic {{falconry}} that discusses the use of owls in falconry. However, {{there are at least}} two species that have successfully been used, the Eurasian <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> and the great horned owl.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of birds, such as the tawny owl, the long-eared owl, the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl,</b> hawks, and short-toed eagles. Other birds of prey have been recorded, as well as a growing number of ravens, crows and magpies {{migrating}} into Ljubljana and Maribor where they thrive. Other birds include black and green woodpeckers and the white stork, which nests mainly in Prekmurje.|$|E

25|$|The firm land of {{the delta}} used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and {{replaced}} with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (Salix alba, Salix fragilis, Salix purpurea, Salix petandra, Salix triandra etc.) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (Populus alba). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the levees of Letea and Caraorman, mixed forests of oak (Quercus robur, Quercus pedunculiflora) with various trees (Fraxinus pallisae, Ulmus foliacea, Populus tremula), shrubs (Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa canina, Berberis vulgaris etc.), and vines (Vitis sylvestris, Hedera helix, Humulus lupulus, Periploca graeca, which reaches up to 25m) grow on sand dune areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called hasmace. Fauna of this region include the meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), and Eurasian <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo bubo), etc.|$|E
500|$|Predators of {{the barn}} owl include large American opossums (Didelphis), the common raccoon, and similar {{carnivorous}} mammals, as well as eagles, larger hawks and other owls. Among the latter, the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) in the Americas and the Eurasian eagle-owl (B. bubo) are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming {{that there is little}} evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principle predators of barn owls are Verreaux's eagle-owls and cape eagle-owls. In Europe, although less dangerous than the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl,</b> the chief diurnal predators are the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). About a dozen other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the scarcely larger tawny owl to the golden eagle. The goshawk and the <b>eagle</b> <b>owl</b> are on the increase because of the greater protection these birds now receive.|$|E

2500|$|The fennec has a {{life span}} of up to 14 years in captivity. Its main predators are the African {{varieties}} of <b>eagle</b> <b>owl.</b> Families of fennecs dig out dens in sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as [...] and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus Vulpes; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and {{in some parts of}} the world, the animal is considered an exotic pet.|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century Francis Willughby (1635–1672) and John Ray (1627–1705) came up {{with the}} first major system of bird {{classification}} that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby's Ornithologiae libri tres (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on Ornithologia which was published posthumously in 1713 as Synopsis methodica avium et piscium. The earliest list of British birds, Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum was written by Christopher Merrett in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value. Ray did however, value the expertise of the naturalist Sir Thomas Browne (1605–82) who, not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence. Browne himself in his lifetime kept an <b>eagle,</b> <b>owl,</b> cormorant, bittern and ostrich, penned a tract on falconry, and introduced the words incubation and oviparous into the English language.|$|E
