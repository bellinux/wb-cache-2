5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> around, or crossing in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly and slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E

5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E

Many of the canopies are designed to resemble the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building (which is located Downtown and listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Works of public art included at several stations were developed {{as part of the}} UTA's Art <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> program. At first the program was met with skepticism; initially, only the stations constructed in Salt Lake City incorporated public art into their designs. This was the case as the city was initially the only one {{to take part in the}} Art <b>in</b> <b>Transit</b> program. The program has since grown in popularity, and many of the stations constructed as part of the FrontLines 2015 expansion will include public art in their final design.|$|E

Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E

On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> traffic.|$|E

On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship {{is the only one}} in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b>|$|E
40|$|Transit {{migration}} is generally defined by migrants having {{the intention to}} move onwards to a third country. Based on an empirical investigation <b>in</b> Izmir, a <b>transit</b> migration hub <b>in</b> Turkey, this paper critically discusses intentionality as a valid dimension <b>in</b> conceptualisations of <b>transit</b> migration. The study found that migrants' intentions <b>in</b> this <b>transit</b> migration hub are highly fluctuating because of their embeddedness in socio-institutional environments, which continuously affect migrants' social capital, risk perceptions and coping strategies, causing new migration intentions to arise. The study argues that intention is a problematic criterion <b>in</b> conceptualising <b>transit</b> migration, due to a conceptual fallacy where transit migration flows are taken as {{the unit of analysis}} whereas intentions are individual attributes...|$|R

5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars.

Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{exported}} grain left Poland through Danzig (Gdańsk), {{which became}} the wealthiest, most highly developed, and most autonomous of the Polish cities because of its location {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula River and access to the Baltic Sea.

Other towns were negatively affected by Danzig's near-monopoly in foreign trade, but profitably participated <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> and export activities.
