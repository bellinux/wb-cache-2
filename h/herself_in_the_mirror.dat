5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{protection}} spell is causing Regina {{to believe that}} Emma trapped her inside, and as she sees <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> Regina changes her clothes to those she used to wear as the Evil Queen. When Emma and Elsa arrive and unseal the Vault, Regina uses her pyrokinetic powers against them and they shield themselves with the ribbons on their wrists; the ribbons free Emma and Elsa, and Emma uses her powers to stall Regina from going after them. Regina, believing that Emma went to the Sheriff's station, shows up there, only {{to set up a}} battle between her and Mary Margaret. Regina then makes Anna and Kristoff disappear, and they end up on the beachfront. As Kristoff argues with Anna, she trips her leg on a bottle. Anna picks up the bottle and hits Kristoff on his head knocking him out, allowing the letter that was inside the bottle to fall into Anna's hands. Anna then reads the letter and she races off to the Snow Queen's lair.|$|E

60|$|At {{ten minutes}} to seven Dulcie was ready. She looked at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrinkly <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> {{reflection}} was satisfactory. The dark blue dress, fitting without a wrinkle, the hat with its jaunty black feather, the but-slightly-soiled gloves--all representing self-denial, even of food itself--were vastly becoming.|$|R
60|$|Clara had. She {{was taking}} a {{farewell}} look at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far-away <b>mirror</b> through <b>the</b> door into her bedroom.

500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury. After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she sees <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman staring back at her.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Silence" [...] was {{directed}} by Nzingha Stewart before the video for [...] "All Night Long" [...] was shot. The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all of her back while sitting {{on the floor next to}} a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing up in front of a microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.|$|E
60|$|Amid Anne's peal of {{laughter}} Phil came downstairs, trailing clouds of glory, and surveyed <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long oval <b>mirror</b> on <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
60|$|When she again {{examined}} <b>herself</b> critically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{she decided}} her outfit was now complete, {{and to her}} inexperienced eyes there was no perceptible difference {{between her and the}} women who had stood outside the window. Whereupon she tried to leave the store, but found every door fast locked.|$|R
60|$|When she {{was ready}} {{she picked up her}} bouquet and looked <b>herself</b> over <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> from <b>the</b> top of her curly head to the tips of her white shoes, with a little nod of satisfaction. Grace was not exactly pretty, but she had such a bright, happy face and such merry brown eyes and such a {{friendly}} smile that she was very pleasant to look upon, and a great many people thought so that night.|$|R
2500|$|After a three-day-long cocaine binge in 2005, Carlisle {{says she}} looked at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and [...] "didn't see a light or a soul" [...] in her eyes: [...] "I just thought, ‘I know I don’t look like myself anymore.'" [...] The same morning, she had an {{auditory}} hallucination telling her she would be found dead {{in a hotel room}} if she did not stop using drugs. The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she has been sober since 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and cried.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of facial expressions, however, is not solely limited to interpersonal situations. Since humans are inherently social beings, they often imagine themselves {{in social situations}} {{even when they are}} alone. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of different contexts: treating oneself as a social interactant (talking to oneself), imagining others are present (either who are currently existent or have died), envisioning future social interactions, and personifying animals or inanimate objects (talking to pets). Solitary facial expressions are generated for an imagined other. According to role and impression- management theories, a perceived audience, whether real or imaginary, causes one to assume a role that is consistent with their audience. For example, a young girl may smile to <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> while imagining herself talking to a boy from class, but may grimace while imagining herself responding to her mother's scolding. Thus, [...] "solitary faces occur for the same reasons as public ones, if only because when we are alone we create social interactions in our imaginations. They suggest the possibility that sociality may {{play a major role in}} the mediation of solitary faces". There are developmental differences in solitary facial expression, beginning with instinctive expressions in infancy and developing into more complex ones as a child's concept of sociality and emotion matures.|$|E
60|$|She {{introduced}} Spencer. He bowed awkwardly and sat stiffly down by {{the window}} with his eyes riveted on Miss LeMar's face. Estella, catching a glimpse of <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old-fashioned <b>mirror</b> above <b>the</b> mantel, suddenly felt a cold chill of dissatisfaction. Her figure had never seemed to her so stout and stiff, her brown hair so dull and prim, her complexion so muddy, her features so commonplace. She wished Miss LeMar would {{go out of the}} room.|$|R
60|$|At {{another time}} Elizabeth might have turned upon him and rent {{him for that}} speech. But it {{happened}} {{that she was in}} high good-humour that afternoon, and disposed to indulgence. She laughed, surveying <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small steel <b>mirror</b> that dangled from her waist.|$|R

60|$|By sunset {{she was at}} {{the door}} of the Howard house--a pretentious abode, with white scroll-work round the eaves and an {{eruption}} of bay-windows on all its sides. Mrs. Howard, a plump, voluble dame, met Rilla gushingly and left her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parlour while she went to call Irene. Rilla threw off her rain-coat and looked at <b>herself</b> critically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> over <b>the</b> mantel. Hair, hat, and dress were satisfactory--nothing there for Miss Irene to make fun of. Rilla remembered how clever and amusing she used to think Irene's biting little comments about other girls.

60|$|Sometimes {{she thought}} {{it might not be}} Tommy, but herself, who was so unlike other people; that it was not he who was unable to love, but she who could not be loved. This idea did not agitate her as a terrible thing; she could almost welcome it. But she did not go to him with it. While it might be but a fancy, that was no way to help a man who was overfull of them. It was the bare truth only that she wanted him to see, and so she made {{elaborate}} inquiries into herself, to discover whether she was quite unlovable. I suppose it would have been quaint, had she not been quite so much in earnest. She examined <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long <b>mirror</b> most conscientiously, and with a determinedly open mind, to see whether she was too ugly for any man to love. Our beautiful Grizel really did.|$|R

During {{the second half of the}} video, Meyer-Landrut is also seen in a room full of mirrors dancing alongside several silver-dressed alien-like dancers. The video ends with Meyer-Landrut jumping into a mirror, which breaks and she disappears.|$|R

60|$|She {{went up to}} her room. There {{really was}} not much to do. She could quite well finish her packing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. She {{sat down at the}} desk and set to work to arrange her papers. It was a warm spring evening, and the window was open. A crowd of noisy sparrows seemed to be delighted about something. From somewhere, unseen, a {{blackbird}} was singing. She read over her report for Mrs. Denton. The blackbird seemed never to have heard of war. He sang as if the whole world were a garden of languor and love. Joan looked at her watch. The first gong would sound in a few minutes. She pictured the dreary, silent dining-room with its few scattered occupants, and her heart sank at the prospect. To her relief came remembrance of a cheerful but entirely respectable restaurant near to the Louvre to which she had been taken a few nights before. She had noticed quite a number of women dining there alone. She closed her dispatch case with a snap and gave a glance at <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> blackbird was still singing.|$|R
