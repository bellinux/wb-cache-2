5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

25|$|The {{idealized}} ruler, {{known as}} a straightedge, {{is assumed to be}} infinite in length, and has no markings on it with only one edge. The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> so may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with collapsing compass; see compass equivalence theorem.) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by Euclid's first three postulates.|$|E
25|$|Paper {{companies}} {{produced a}} special form of typewriter paper called erasable bond (for example, Eaton's Corrasable Bond). This incorporated {{a thin layer}} of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.|$|E
25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> After this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make it dry faster, although this may smudge it. Usually {{there needs to be a}} pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E

2500|$|The IBM System/360 Model 67, {{which was}} {{introduced}} Aug. 1965, included an MMU that {{was called a}} dynamic address translation (DAT) box.

[...] They refer to physical memory rather than virtual memory, and are accessed by special-purpose instructions. [...] This reduces overhead for the OS, which would otherwise need to propagate accessed and dirty bits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> tables to a more physically oriented data structure.

2500|$|Cole {{responded that}} while he {{personally}} despised [...] "everything Ahmadinejad stands for, {{not to mention the}} odious Khomeini", he nonetheless objected to the New York Times translation. Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel ("that he wants to play Hitler to Israel's Poland"). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be [...] "the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> of time," [...] a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one. He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.|$|E
2500|$|The robots attribute, {{supported}} by several major search engines, controls whether search engine spiders {{are allowed to}} index a page, or not, and whether they should follow links from a page, or not.
