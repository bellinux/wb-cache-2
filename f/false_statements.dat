5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} <b>false.</b> <b>Statements</b> that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M.

50|$|A <b>false</b> <b>{{statement}}</b> {{need not}} be a lie. A lie is a statement that is known to be untrue and is used to mislead.

40|$|Three ethical {{rules are}} both clear and highly {{desirable}} - MR 3. 3 (a) (1), which forbids {{a lawyer to}} make a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> of fact to a tribunal; MR 4. 1 (a), which forbids a lawyer to make a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> of material fact to a third person; and MR 8. 4 (c), which proscribes conductinvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Nevertheless, by considering the larger legal context of the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role, by understanding inconsistent ethical rules {{in the light of}} reason, and by applying insights of moral philosophy, this article concludes that there are circumstances in which a lawyer can ethically make a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> of fact to a tribunal, can ethically make a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> of material fact to a third person, and can ethically engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation...|$|R

In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was {{closely associated with}} the Thousand Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas. Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made <b>false</b> <b>statements</b> to induce merchants to provide goods and services.

5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making <b>false</b> <b>statements</b> to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making <b>false</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|E
