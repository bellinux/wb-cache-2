5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses {{on the question of whether}} or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E

5|$|Despite Lee's <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> {{an early}} start, {{it took all}} morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E

A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, as Berkman {{finished}} {{the fifth year}} of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed to object to the trial judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> early release. The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.|$|E
