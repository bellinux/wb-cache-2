After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant or {{breastfeeding}} {{women should}} consult a doctor {{before taking a}} vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that droppers accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 25ng cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the <b>dropper</b> hold no more than 400 IU. For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25μg/day (1,000IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month. After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) , has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500IU per day for ages 1–3 years, 3,000IU per day for ages 4–8 years and 4,000IU per day for ages 9–71+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).|$|E

25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to <b>dropper</b> loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The bait used is normally anything from the surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small soft plastic lures. In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E

Although the team stated that he had typhoid fever, still common in 1915, Lieb wrote after Stengel's death in 1975 that the ballplayer had gonorrhea. [...] Stengel may have been involved in a well-known incident during spring training when Robinson agreed to catch a baseball dropped from an airplane piloted by Ruth Law—except that it proved not to be a baseball, but a small grapefruit, much to the manager's shock, as he assumed the liquid on him was blood. Law stated that she dropped the grapefruit as she had forgotten the baseball, but Stengel retold the story, imitating Robinson, many times in his later years, with himself as grapefruit <b>dropper,</b> and is often given the credit for the stunt.

2500|$|Opium {{tincture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent oral formulations of morphine available by prescription. [...] Accidental or deliberate overdose is common with opium tincture given the highly concentrated nature of the solution. Overdose and death may occur with a single oral dose of between 100 and 150mg of morphine in a healthy adult who is not habituated to opiates. [...] This represents the equivalent of between two to three teaspoons of opium tincture. [...] Suicide by laudanum was not uncommon in the mid-19th century.

40|$|BBL ™ PYR Reagent <b>Droppers</b> {{are used}} in the rapid {{presumptive}} identification of group A β-hemolytic streptococci and group D enterococci. 1, 2 SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION PYR Reagent <b>Droppers</b> {{are used in}} a rapid test for determining the ability of bacteria to produce pyrrolidonyl peptidase. The production of pyrrolidonyl peptidase (PYRase) has been widely used as an aid in differentiating certain streptococci species. 1 - 3 Following incubation of organisms with a PYR substrate, the reagent (cinnamaldehyde) is added. Color development indicates a positive reaction. The color change is both rapid and long lasting, making results easy to interpret. PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE Pyrrolidonase peptidase activity can be evaluated by the hydrolysis of pyroglutamylβ-naphthylamide (L-pyrrolidone-β-naphthylamide [PYR]) into L-pyrrolidone and β-naphthylamine, which combines with a PYR reagent to produce a red color. 4, 5 PYR Reagent <b>Droppers</b> can be used with any PYR substrate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was carried out to {{determinate}} the Possibility of utilization of Karkheh River water for drip irrigation. Regarding climatic conditions of Iran, it is necessary to apply high efficiency irrigation methods particularly for crops with high water requirement. Clogging of <b>droppers</b> is the most important and serious issue that threatens a trickle irrigation system. In the present article, in order to study the potential of Karkheh River as a water source, the water quality of the river was examined in 5 stations along the river in a 30 -year period. To prognosticate the potentiality of carbonate calcium sedimentation and the corrosion in the irrigation equipments, Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and Ryzner Stability Index (RSL) were used, respectively. The results showed that, based on Wilcox diagram, the water of this river enjoys appropriate quality for agricultural purposes in most cases (with the exception of droughts). The results also showed that the LSI w as positive in all stations and it is possible that <b>droppers</b> clog due to carbonate calcium deposition. While, RSL was in most cases below 6. 8 and there is little possibility of metal parts corrosion in trickle irrigation system. It can be recommended that, regarding limited water sources, downstream lands of this river can be irrigated through trickle irrigation systems with <b>droppers</b> that are less sensitive to clogging in order to prevent from chemically clogging of <b>droppers.</b> Finally, acid washing by collecting watering pipes and <b>droppers</b> in one place and injection of acid after is recommendable...|$|R
