5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are not included in this list. Twelve species are unique (endemic) to the island of Tasmania, and most of these are common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's endemic birds have led to it being classified as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they are defined by containing two or more restricted-range (<b>endemic)</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|Diverse life exists {{within the}} range, {{including}} endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals {{in the area}} consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both <b>endemic</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hawaii's {{geographical}} isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a {{large number}} of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.|$|E

50|$|It is estimated, {{that there}} are about 10,000 species of plants in this {{biodiversity}} hotspot region. About 1,200 species and 12 genera are endemic. The island of Sulawesi has about 500 <b>endemic</b> plant <b>species.</b> The islands of Moluccas have about 300 <b>endemic</b> plant <b>species</b> and the Lesser Sunda Islands consist of at least 110 <b>endemic</b> plant <b>species.</b> Little {{is known about the}} flora of this region. Three of these unique species, Agathis, Pterocarpus indicus and Eucalyptus deglupta, are mentioned as examples.|$|R
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is far enough away and has had sufficient time to evolve <b>endemic</b> <b>species.</b> The high degree of endemism is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> like the wedding lily (Dietes robinsoniana) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species of}} macaw {{have also been}} mentioned, but many never {{received}} binomials, or are considered junior synonyms of other species. Williams and Steadman defended the validity of most named Caribbean macaw species, and wrote that each Greater and Lesser Antillean island probably had its own <b>endemic</b> <b>species.</b> Olson and Maíz doubted {{the validity of the}} hypothetical macaws, and that all Antillean islands once had <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> but wrote that the island of Hispaniola would be the most likely place for another macaw species to have existed because of the large land area, though no descriptions or remains of such are known. They wrote that such a species could have been driven to extinction before the arrival of Europeans. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through palaeontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E

5|$|The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of {{the mild}} Antarctic zone, with strong {{connections}} to {{the flora and fauna}} of Patagonia in mainland South America. Land birds make up most of the Falklands' avifauna; 63 species breed on the islands, including 16 <b>endemic</b> <b>species.</b> There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands. The Falklands' flora consists of 163 native vascular species. The islands' only native terrestrial mammal, the warrah, was hunted to extinction by European settlers.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is variable. Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly {{coloured}} plumage. The Ptilinopus (fruit doves) {{are some of the}} brightest-coloured pigeons, with the three <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> of Fiji and the Indian Ocean Alectroenas being the brightest. Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|There are 37,000 known {{species in}} Croatia, but their actual number is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia {{in the first half of}} the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.|$|E

Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, features savanna birds such as the black-headed gonolek and those associated with swamps and lakes, including storks and cranes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
5|$|Arran {{also has}} three rare <b>endemic</b> <b>species</b> of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These are the Scottish or Arran {{whitebeam}}, the cut-leaved whitebeam and the Catacol whitebeam, which are amongst the most endangered tree {{species in the}} world. They are found in a protected national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 283 Arran whitebeam and 236 cut-leaved whitebeam were recorded as mature trees in 1980. The Catacol whitebeam was discovered in 2007 and steps {{have been taken to}} protect the two known specimens.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has 38,226 known taxa, 2.8% {{of which}} are endemic; the actual number (including undiscovered species) is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone. There are more than a thousand <b>endemic</b> <b>species,</b> especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. Indigenous cultivars of plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
