The game was first shown publicly by Nintendo at their Nintendo World Touch DS event in early 2005. The version of the game displayed there was an early model, and between its reveal and release, it underwent some changes to improve the usability and quality. As a pre-order bonus, Nintendo created a special CD containing selected tracks form the game, and a special calendar commemorating the series' 15th anniversary. The game released in Japan on April 20, 2005.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E

5|$|The episodes all {{contain a}} {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must kill, stun, or avoid. These enemies are typically aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as electricity or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Invasion of the Vorticons features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; Keen Dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 Commander Keen has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{illustrated}} by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece has been serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 22, 1997.

5|$|Alto's Adventure is a side-scrolling endless runner snowboarding game. The player {{character}} moves automatically through procedurally generated landscapes {{towards the}} right side of the screen and the player can only control when to <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> player taps the screen once to jump and holds the screen while the player character is midair to perform tricks. While the character moves across the landscape, the player can complete some of the game's 180 goals, though they are given only three at a time. Goals include such things as traveling a set distance, rescuing runaway llamas, crossing dangerous gaps, grinding across rooftops of villages, and outsmarting the mountain elders. The player receives awards from completing goals, and can also collect coins that can be used to purchase upgrades. Players perform tricks in quick succession, or combos, to earn points towards a competitive high score. The game also tracks distance traveled and trick combos. Later in the game, players can use a wingsuit, which changes some elements of the game. The environments of Alto's Adventure change in lighting as time passes through the cycle of the day, and incorporate various weather effects. Player progress syncs between iPads and iPhones over iCloud, and the game uses Game Center leaderboards.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to <b>jump</b> <b>the</b> fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E
