40|$|Wall mounted {{loudspeakers}} {{are becoming}} more and more appealing to the average home. The disadvantage with these kinds of loudspeakers is that the acoustic flaws of a room, in most cases, get more excited. A company named DLS Svenska AB is keen to find a solution to this problem and the following mission statement, translated from Swedish to English, was handed to the author from their loudspeaker engineer named Mats Andersen:“Mission to investigate, measure and verify the possibility to remove/minimize the effect the closest room boundary has on the sound from wall mounted speakers, or speakers standing close to a wall, using acoustic and electrical solutions. With focus on acoustic solutions. Electric solutions essentially means analog solutions, but also to examine digital solutions (DSP). ”Five different prototypes called Chamfer, Plate, Pressient, Toploaded and Type R were developed based on acoustical theories. Chamfer was focusing on edge diffractions. Plate had a wide baffle which would lower the box shadowing. Pressient and Type R were based on microphone technologies and Toploaded used an acoustical mirror. Frequency spectrums for all the prototypes were measured in a room called multi-studio and in an anechoic chamber. By doing this it was possible to identify the problems created by the wall behind the loudspeaker. The polar patterns were measured in the anechoic chamber to investigate if the prototypes had the wanted radiation patterns. The results produced by the experiments in this thesis say that it is possible to minimize the effect the closest room boundary (i. e. the wall behind the loudspeaker) has on the sound from wall mounted speakers. However, it is not possible to remove the effect completely, with the tested acoustical solutions. Electrical solutions were not investigated since it fell outside the author’s educational orientation. Some of the prototypes did not behave as expected. All of the prototypes require further work to be usable for conventional loudspeakers, even those which had good cardioid or <b>half</b> <b>spherical</b> characteristics. Chamfer did minimize the back radiation quite well, but some pretty drastic interference appears when the baffle ends right at a room boundary. Plate did extend the box shadowing to lower frequencies so the reflections would not disturb the midrange as much. The baffle did, on the other hand, create drastic edge diffractions. Pressient did not work at all. It had a system which works in theory but needs more implementation in real life to work properly. Toploaded had more success than the previous prototypes. The acoustical mirror worked very well and the prototype acted as ka goes to zero up to 900 Hz instead of creating minimum and maximum. The theory for Type R works, but it created some acoustical disturbances which make it unsuitable for conventional use. Validerat; 20150224 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|In 1952, A. M. Turing[1] {{proposed}} that the reaction-diffusion system could explain the main phenomena of biological morphogenesis. Unfortunately, he died in 1954. However, Turing's intriguing ideas influenced the thinking of theoretical biologists and scientists of many fields. The Turing mechanism has been successfully used for generating patterns in mammals[2, 3], fish[4 - 6], bacterial colonies[7 - 9], phyllotaxis[10, 11] and many others. We simulate the patterns on the elytras of the lady beetles using a reaction-diffusion equation with two types of morphogens based on the Turing model[12]. A part of a <b>half</b> <b>spherical</b> surface is used to approximate the geometry of the hard wings. Various patterns common to lady beetles in Taiwan can be produced on this curved surface. A complex system like the leopard's skin marking still offers an optimal level of challenge for generating it, even though previous simulations using a one-stage Turing model[13 - 16] might have produced final rosette patterns similar the patterns of real leopards. Based {{on the results of}} phylogenetic analysis, which showed that flecks are the primitive pattern of the felid family and all other patterns including rosettes and blotches develop from it[17], we construct a two-stage Turing reaction-diffusion model[18] which generates spot patterns initially. In the first stage, spots are generated in a similar manner for both the leopard cub and the jaguar cub. In the second stage, we tune model paraments to generate, separately, the sequence of patterns transformation during the growth of the animals. 英國數學家涂林於 1952 年[1]提出「解釋生物形態發生的反應擴散模型」的創見，不幸卻於 1954 年早逝，但他的想法已經引起理論生物學家與許多領域的科學家的注意與興趣，開始從事於涂林機制的研究。至今在生物圖案形成的應用累積了許多豐碩的成果，例如成功模擬出哺乳動物毛皮圖案[2, 3]、魚類的圖紋[4 - 6]、細菌群聚的圖樣[7 - 9]、與植物的葉序[10, 11]…等等。 台灣特有的瓢蟲身上豔麗多樣的圖案吸引我們的注意，嘗試將部分的半球面視為瓢蟲的鞘翅(elytra) ，以兩種成形素(morphogens) 的涂林方程，給予不同的初始濃度分佈與參數，成功製造出不同種類的瓢蟲花紋[12]。 此外對於複雜的豹紋花樣，過去一些以單階段涂林模型的研究，雖然曾經製造出與花豹相類似的玫瑰斑紋[13 - 16]，但是斑紋隨年齡成長的變化過程的問題，仍然懸而未決。根據動植物種類史的分析(phylogenetic analysis) ，顯示貓科動物身上的不同種的斑紋─包括複雜的玫瑰紋(rosettes) 與擴散狀的污斑(blotches) ─是從點(flecks) 演化而來的[17]，我們提出了兩階段的涂林模型[18]，成功的模擬出花豹(leopard) 與美洲豹(jaguar) 身上複雜的斑紋結構：第一階段首先利用涂林模型製造出點的圖案，對照於剛出生的幼豹的斑紋；第二階段以點為初始條件，調變模型中部分的參數，隨著參數的變化過程，圖案的改變呈現出真實豹紋在成長中的變化。目錄 中文摘要	ⅰ 英文摘要	ⅱ 目錄	ⅲ 圖表目次	ⅵ 第一章 簡介	 1 一、 引言	 1 二、 涂林模型	 2 三、 涂林模型的發展歷史	 2 第二章 數學分析	 6 一、 反應動力學項(Reaction Kinetics term) 	 6 二、 涂林方程式的線性穩定分析	 8 三、 初始值對模選擇的影響	 18 第三章 瓢蟲花紋模擬	 20 一、 模型與線性穩定分析	 21 二、 數值模擬	 22 三、 模擬的結果	 32 (一) 五斑廣盾瓢蟲	 32 (二) 七星瓢蟲	 34 (三) 杜虹十星瓢蟲	 34 (四) 縱條黃瓢蟲	 36 (五) 細紋裸瓢蟲	 37 第四章 豹紋的模擬	 40 一、 模型與線性穩定分析	 43 二、 兩階段涂林模型	 50 三、 δ對數值模擬的影響	 55 四、 數值模擬與結果	 58 第五章 二維傅立葉轉換分析	 64 第六章 結論	 70 附錄A 反應擴散方程去因次的推導	 71 附錄B 美洲豹、花豹與獵豹	 73 附錄C 催化物-抑制物系統與基質消耗系統	 78 附錄D 以兩階段涂林模型模擬台灣的雲豹的毛皮圖案	 82 附錄E 論文的相關報導摘錄	 83 一、 PHYSICS NEW UPDATE, 26. 09. 2001 	 83 二、 Sciscape新聞報導, 28. 09. 2001 	 84 三、 SCIENCE NEWS, 06. 10. 2001 	 86 四、 Nature, online News, 04. 08. 2006 	 89 五、 Nature 442, Research Highlights, 10. 08. 2006 	 92 六、 知識通訊評論, 16. 08. 2006 	 93 七、 Math Digest, 08. 2006 	 95 八、 LiveScience, 08. 08. 2006 	 97 九、 SCIENCE&VIE, 10. 2006 	 99 十、 2007 傑出團隊研究成果	 100 十一、動手玩碎形 (天下文化出版) 	 101 參考資料	 102 圖表目次 圖 1 - 1 七星瓢蟲的成長圖	 4 圖 1 - 2 在化學實驗系統所觀察到的涂林結構圖	 5 圖 1 - 3 催化物-抑制物系統典型的示意圖	 5 圖 2 - 1 特徵值與固定點穩定性之對應關係圖(不含k) 	 11 圖 2 - 2 特徵值與固定點穩定性之對應關係圖(含k) 	 13 圖 2 - 3 Ãk(k 2) 行列式的函數曲線圖	 17 圖 2 - 4 不同D值的色散關係圖	 17 圖 2 - 5 滿足涂林不穩定的色散關係圖	 18 圖 2 - 6 典型線性分析得到的色散關係圖	 19 圖 3 - 1 白斑褐瓢蟲(Halyzia sanscrita) 	 20 圖 3 - 2 滿足涂林不穩定的色散關係圖	 23 圖 3 - 3 (fu+gv) 與σv的函數關係圖	 25 圖 3 - 4 (fu+gv) 與κ的函數關係圖	 26 圖 3 - 5 (fugv+fvgu) 與κ的函數關係圖	 26 圖 3 - 6 Dv/Du與κ的函數關係圖 	 27 圖 3 - 7 點的大小與Du、Dv/Du的關係	 28 圖 3 - 8 點、線與κ的關係 	 30 圖 3 - 9 模擬瓢蟲鞘翅的半球面座標 	 31 圖 3 - 10 瓢蟲鞘翅的差異 	 31 圖 3 - 11 五斑廣盾瓢蟲	 33 圖 3 - 12 七星瓢蟲	 34 圖 3 - 13 杜虹十星瓢蟲	 35 圖 3 - 14 白條菌瓢蟲	 37 圖 3 - 15 細紋裸瓢蟲	 39 圖 4 - 1 貓科動物尾巴的圖案	 40 圖 4 - 2 模擬花豹的玫瑰斑紋	 41 圖 4 - 3 模擬花豹的玫瑰斑紋	 41 圖 4 - 4 模擬花豹的玫瑰斑紋	 42 圖 4 - 5 模擬幼小美洲豹的斑紋	 42 圖 4 - 6 點、線與r 2 的關係	 45 圖 4 - 7 涂林參數空間與色散關係圖	 50 圖 4 - 8 條紋棘蝶魚(Pomacanthus imperator) 	 51 圖 4 - 9 疊波棘蝶魚(Pomacanthus semicirculatus) 	 52 圖 4 - 10 Weigel提出的假設：貓科動物斑紋的演化途徑 	 53 圖 4 - 11 Werdelin與Olsson將貓科動物的斑紋歸類成六種花紋	 54 圖 4 - 12 Werdelin與Olsson認為貓科動物的斑紋的演化途徑	 54 圖 4 - 13 不同δ的色散關係圖	 55 圖 4 - 14 δ與線疏密的關係圖	 56 圖 4 - 15 δ與點疏密的關係圖	 57 圖 4 - 16 不同δ的色散關係圖	 60 圖 4 - 17 不同D的色散關係圖	 60 圖 4 - 18 模擬美洲豹的過程中，改變參數D與δ時的色散關係	 61 圖 4 - 19 第一階段以涂林模型模擬點的圖案	 61 圖 4 - 20 模擬花豹的第二階的過程	 62 圖 4 - 21 模擬美洲豹的第二階的過程	 62 圖 4 - 22 α-β參數平面	 63 圖 5 - 1 美洲豹四個典型的圖案與對應的二維傅立葉轉換	 65 圖 5 - 2 二維傅立葉頻譜，水平橫切線的強度分佈	 68 圖 5 - 3 二維傅立葉逆轉換 	 69 圖 B-J 美洲豹成長過程	 74 圖 B-L 花豹成長過程	 76 圖 C- 1 不同反應系統的null clines	 79 圖 C- 2 固定態附近的行為模式	 80 圖 C- 3 催化物-抑制物的機制與基質消耗的機制	 80 圖 C- 4 模擬瓢蟲鞘翅斑紋的系統，在相空間中的null clines	 81 圖 C- 5 模擬豹紋的系統，在相空間中的null clines	 81 圖 D 以兩階段涂林模型模擬台灣的雲豹的毛皮圖案	 8...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the correlations between}} the black hole mass M_BH, the velocity dispersion σ, the bulge mass M_Bu, the bulge average spherical density ρ_h and its <b>spherical</b> <b>half</b> mass radius r_h, constructing a database of 97 galaxies (31 core ellipticals, 17 power-law ellipticals, 30 classical bulges, 19 pseudo bulges) by joining 72 galaxies from the literature to 25 galaxies observed during our recent SINFONI black hole survey. For the first time we discuss the full error covariance matrix. We analyse the well known M_BH-σ and M_BH-M_Bu relations and establish the existence of statistically significant correlations between M_Bu and r_h and anti-correlations between M_Bu and ρ_h. We establish five significant bivariate correlations (M_BH-σ-ρ_h, M_BH-σ-r_h, M_BH-M_Bu-σ, M_BH-M_Bu-ρ_h, M_BH-M_Bu-r_h) that predict M_BH of 77 core and power-law ellipticals and classical bulges with measured and intrinsic scatter as small as ≈ 0. 36 dex and ≈ 0. 33 dex respectively, or 0. 26 dex when the subsample of 45 galaxies defined by Kormendy and Ho (2013) is considered. In contrast, pseudo bulges have systematically lower M_BH, but approach the predictions of all the above relations at spherical densities ρ_h> 10 ^ 10 M_/kpc^ 3 or scale lengths r_h< 1 kpc. These findings fit in a scenario of co-evolution of BH and classical-bulge masses, where core ellipticals are the product of dry mergers of power-law bulges and power-law Es and bulges the result of (early) gas-rich mergers and of disk galaxies. In contrast, the (secular) growth of BHs is decoupled from the growth of their pseudo bulge hosts, except when (gas) densities are high enough to trigger the feedback mechanism responsible for the existence of the correlations between M_BH and galaxy structural parameters.

40|$|The Earth Observing System (EOS) {{spacecraft}} Terra, Aqua, and Aura fly in constellation {{with several}} other spacecraft in 705 -kilometer mean altitude sun-synchronous orbits. All three spacecraft are operated by the Earth Science Mission Operations (ESMO) Project at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). In 2004, the ESMO project began assessing the probability of collision of the EOS spacecraft with other space objects. In addition to conjunctions with high relative velocities, the collision assessment method for the EOS spacecraft must address conjunctions with low relative velocities during potential collisions between constellation members. Probability of Collision algorithms {{that are based on}} assumptions of high relative velocities and linear relative trajectories are not suitable for these situations; therefore an algorithm for handling the nonlinear relative trajectories was developed. This paper describes this algorithm and presents results from its validation for operational use. The probability of collision is typically calculated by integrating a Gaussian probability distribution over the volume swept out by a sphere representing the size of the space objects involved in the conjunction. This sphere is defined as the Hard Body Radius. With the assumption of linear relative trajectories, this volume is a cylinder, which translates into simple limits of integration for the probability calculation. For the case of nonlinear relative trajectories, the volume becomes a complex geometry. However, with an appropriate choice of coordinate systems, the new algorithm breaks down the complex geometry into a series of simple cylinders that have simple limits of integration. This nonlinear algorithm will be discussed in detail in the paper. The nonlinear Probability of Collision algorithm was first verified by showing that, when used in high relative velocity cases, it yields similar answers to existing high relative velocity linear relative trajectory algorithms. The comparison with the existing high velocity/linear theory will also be used to determine at what relative velocity the analysis should use the new nonlinear theory in place of the existing linear theory. The nonlinear algorithm was also compared to a known exact solution for the probability of collision between two objects when the relative motion is strictly circular and the error covariance is spherically symmetric. Figure I shows preliminary results from this comparison by plotting the probabilities calculated from the new algorithm and those from the exact solution versus the Hard Body Radius to Covariance ratio. These results show about 5 % error when the Hard Body Radius is equal to one <b>half</b> the <b>spherical</b> covariance magnitude. The algorithm was then combined with a high fidelity orbit state and error covariance propagator into a useful tool for analyzing low relative velocity nonlinear relative trajectories. The high fidelity propagator is capable of using atmospheric drag, central body gravitational, solar radiation, and third body forces to provide accurate prediction of the relative trajectories and covariance evolution. The covariance propagator also includes a process noise model to ensure realistic evolutions of the error covariance. This paper will describe the integration of the nonlinear probability algorithm and the propagators into a useful collision assessment tool. Finally, a hypothetical case study involving a low relative velocity conjunction between members of the Earth Observation System constellation will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tumor {{response}} {{assessment to}} therapy {{is crucial in}} oncology, both in daily practice and research. We analyzed the morphology of liver metastases (LM) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Aims were to 1) determine whether uni-dimensional measurements of tumor lesions (according to RECIST 1. 1) are accurate reflections of their volumes and 2) estimate eventual bias in volume change calculations, as introduced by using only the longest diameter. Methods: 78 GIST patients with LM were evaluated at baseline (n= 139 lesions), 3 (n= 129), 6 (n= 128), and 12 months (n= 108) after imatinib therapy. LM were segmented semi-automatically on standard CT scans. All measurements at baseline were obtained by 2 independent investigators and agreement between observers was assessed with Bland-Altman plots. Values for segmented volume (Vs; mL), maximum transaxial diameter (MTD; mm), and elongation value (EV, defined as 1 - [width/length], where EV of 1 = fully ellipsoidal and 0 = fully spherical) were reported for each lesion at several time-points. A calculated volume (Vc) of each LM was also generated using the MTD, with the hypothesis that metastases were fully spherical. Results: At baseline, 44 % (61 / 139) of the LM was spherical and 56 % (78 / 139) was ellipsoidal. Their EV ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 94 (mean, 0. 53 ± 0. 17). During treatment, overall 42 % of the lesions kept their morphology (spherical or ellipsoidal) and the other <b>half</b> changed from <b>spherical</b> to ellipsoidal or vice versa. At baseline, there was strong inter-observer agreement in the determination of Vs, with mean inter-observer variability of 1. 5 % (95 % CI, - 14. 5 % to 17. 5 %). The difference between Vs and Vc was highly significant (P< 0. 0001). Vc overestimates the actual volume of 35 % (95 % CI, - 26 % to 95 %). Conclusions: LM are not always spherical and can change their morphology during imatinib therapy. Therefore, a lesion's single largest trans-axial dimension, as used in RECIST 1. 1, is not an accurate surrogate of its actual volume. Further studies are warranted to fully understand the clinical impact of these findings and to assess whether we should apply different criteria for response assessment to therapies in solid tumors...|$|R
