5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained <b>historical</b> <b>climate</b> changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E

The same connection between drought in the Maya areas and extreme cold in northern Europe was found again at the beginning of the 20thcentury.

500|$|The {{difference}} between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase [...] "Climate {{is what you}} expect, weather is what you get." [...] Over historical time spans {{there are a number}} of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5°C (9°F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of <b>historical</b> <b>climate</b> change are concerned.|$|E
40|$|Ecologists {{increasingly}} rely on molecular delimitation methods (MMs) {{to identify}} species boundaries, thereby potentially {{increasing the number}} of putative species {{because of the presence of}} morphologically cryptic species. It has been argued that cryptic species could challenge our understanding of what determine large-scale biodiversity patterns which have traditionally been documented from morphology alone. Here, we used morphology and three MMs to derive four different sets of putative species among the European groundwater crustaceans. Then, we used regression models to compare the relative importance of spatial heterogeneity, productivity and <b>historical</b> <b>climates,</b> in shaping species richness and range size patterns across sets of putative species. We tested three predictions. First, MMs would yield many more putative species than morphology because groundwater is a constraining environment allowing little morphological changes. Second, for species richness, MMs would increase the importance of spatial heterogeneity because cryptic species are more likely along physical barriers separating ecologically similar regions than along resource gradients promoting ecologically-based divergent selection. Third, for range size, MMs would increase the importance of <b>historical</b> <b>climates</b> because of reduced and asymmetrical fragmentation of large morphological species ranges at northern latitudes. MMs yielded twice more putative species than morphology and decreased by 10 -fold the average species range size. Yet, MMs strengthened the mid-latitude ridge of high species richness and the Rapoport effect of increasing range size at higher latitudes. Species richness predictors did not vary between morphology and MMs but the latter increased the proportion of variance in range size explained by <b>historical</b> <b>climates.</b> These findings demonstrate that our knowledge of groundwater biodiversity determinants is robust to overlooked cryptic species because the latter are homogeneously distributed along environmental gradients. Yet, our findings call for incorporating multiple species delimitation methods into the analysis of large-scale biodiversity patterns across a range of taxa and ecosystems. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} risk of present and future indoor climate {{conditions}} within historic buildings on mechanical degradation of wooden art objects, it is of high importance to know the climate variations that these objects might {{have been exposed to}} in the past. <b>Historical</b> indoor <b>climate</b> data can indicate climate variations that may have caused damage to objects. Avoiding these variations in the present and future may prevent new or further degradation. However, <b>historical</b> indoor <b>climate</b> data conditions are often not available and cannot be derived from recent indoor climate data as many historic buildings nowadays have climate control systems. In this study, multi-zone hygrothermal building simulation is applied to reconstruct the <b>historical</b> indoor <b>climate</b> in a 17 th-century Dutch castle based on meteorological data, building properties, and user behaviour. Furthermore, a finite element model is created to analyse heat and moisture induced strain of a historic wooden cabinet. This cabinet has been located in the castle since the 18 th century and shows damage caused by movement of the wood in response to climate variations. Mechanical degradation of the cabinet could have occurred when the strain exceeded the yield strain for safe, reversible deformation. The results show that combining a hygrothermal building simulation model and a finite element model can generate an adequate prediction of the microclimate around an object; though obtaining accurate data on hygroscopic and mechanical material properties can be difficult. Although the cabinet has experienced considerable tension after a conservation heating system was installed in the castle during a recent major renovation, the predicted strain was within the limits for safe, reversible deformation. This corresponds to the observation that no further damage occurred after the renovation. Damage may not be caused by the regular present or <b>historical</b> indoor <b>climate</b> in the castle, but could be indicated if the long-term average moisture content of the wood significantly deviates from the room conditions or if the vapour concentration in the room increases because of a flooding event...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} {{changes in}} forest structure between historical (1930 s) and contemporary (2000 s) surveys of California vegetation through comparisons of tree abundance and size {{across the state}} and within several ecoregions. Across California, tree density in forested regions increased by 30 % between the two time periods, whereas forest biomass in the same regions declined, as indicated by a 19 % reduction in basal area. These changes reflect a demographic shift in forest structure: larger trees (> 61 cm diameter at breast height) have declined, whereas smaller trees (< 30 cm) have increased. Large tree declines were found in all surveyed regions of California, whereas small tree increases were found in every region except the south and central coast. Large tree declines were more severe in areas experiencing greater increases in climaticwater deficit since the 1930 s, based on a hydrologicmodel of water balance for <b>historical</b> <b>climates</b> through the 20 th century.

How have norms of thermal comfort been balanced against conservation needs of the buildings, their interiors and valuable objects? The choice of heating regime in an old church {{can be seen as}} a negotiation between different stakeholders. Together these voices have been articulating a discourse on indoor climate since the late nineteenth century when churches in Sweden were first heated. The <b>historical</b> indoor <b>climate</b> in churches is poorly known but often referred to in discussions on what kind of heating and climate is suitable for interiors and their artifacts.

50|$|To {{identify}} populations at {{risk and}} locate new potential habitats, conservationists often use Niche models. These models predict the suitability of habitats in the future based on how closely their climates resemble the climate currently inhabited by the species. Though useful for describing broad trends, these models make a number of unrealistic assumptions that restrict the usefulness of their predictions. For instance, they do not {{consider the possibility that}} species may be able to develop tolerance of new climates through acclimatization or adaptation. Further, they do not account for the fact that a given species may perform better (e.g., become invasive) or worse (e.g., fail to establish) in a new habitat than in its current range if the community of competitor, predator, and mutualist species is different there. Additionally, because different climate variables (e.g., minimum January temperature, average annual precipitation) rarely shift in unison, it is possible that few areas will exactly match the <b>historical</b> <b>climates</b> of species threatened by climate change. Such multi-directional climate shifts will make it especially difficult to determine the species that are at greatest risk of habitat loss due to climate change and to predict future suitable habitat. The uncertainties in predictions of future suitable habitat limits confidence in assisted colonization decisions and has led some to reject assisted colonization entirely.|$|R

50|$|Viola Klein’s {{thoughts}} were constructed around {{the meaning of}} a femininity concept and the social creation of a feminine character. In her first important work: The Feminine Character: History of an Ideology, she claimed that attitudes in society considered as feminine are not factual observations but preconceptions and particular subjective interpretations (Klein, Correspondence, May 30, 1942, Klein papers). Providing a question about sources of the knowledge about womanhood and examining studies {{from the beginning of the}} 19th century, she wanted to prove that “what we think of specific perspectives are not guaranteed truths but the ideas subject to the influence of surrounding culture and personal bias” (Terrant 2006, p. 134). With her work Klein wanted to demonstrate that scientists, whose assumptions result from particular branches of knowledge, are not free from the social, cultural and <b>historical</b> <b>climates</b> of their time (Klein 1946, p. 30). She observed that scientific objective studies about femininity are full of stereotypes and repeat particular traits like “passivity, emotionally, lack of abstract interests, greater intensity of personal relationships and, an instinctive tenderness for babies” (Klein 1946, p. 164). Therefore, she wanted to define a feminine nature, using notions of social and cultural expectations (Klein 1946, p. 171) “Klein sought to isolate psychological influences on sex difference by excluding sex-related traits that could be attributed to social function, historic tradition and prevailing ideology” (Klein, 1946, p. 129).|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{historical}} droughts and heat-waves on ecosystems are often considered indicative of future global warming impacts, {{under the assumption}} that water stress sets in above a fixed high temperature threshold. Historical and future (RCP 8. 5) Earth system model (ESM) climate projections were analyzed in this study to illustrate changes in the temperatures for onset of water stress under global warming. The ESMs examined here predict sharp declines in gross primary production (GPP) at warm temperature extremes in <b>historical</b> <b>climates,</b> similar to the observed correlations between GPP and temperature during historical heat-waves and droughts. However, soil moisture increases at the warm end of the temperature range, and the temperature at which soil moisture declines with temperature shifts to a higher temperature. The temperature for onset of water stress thus increases under global warming and is associated with a shift in the temperature for maximum GPP to warmer temperatures. Despite the shift in this local temperature optimum, the impacts of warm extremes on GPP are approximately invariant when extremes are defined relative to the optimal temperature within each climate period. The GPP sensitivity to these relative temperature extremes therefore remains similar between future and present climates, suggesting that the heat- and drought-induced GPP reductions seen recently can be expected to be similar in the future, and may be underestimates of future impacts given model projections of increased frequency and persistence of heat-waves and droughts. The local temperature optimum can be understood as the temperature at which the combination of water stress and light limitations is minimized, and this concept gives insights into how GPP responds to climate extremes in both <b>historical</b> and future <b>climate</b> periods. Both cold (temperature and light-limited) and warm (water-limited) relative temperature extremes become more persistent in future climate projections, and the time taken to return to locally optimal climates for GPP following climate extremes increases by more than 25 % over many land regions...|$|R
