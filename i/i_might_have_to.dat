500|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} Angela Frandina, who was found strangled in her bed clutching a note reading, [...] "Ed did it", although it proves to be a false lead. Their investigation leads the detectives to discover Angela had several strange boyfriends and worked at an S fashion store and a phone sex hotline. The two detectives visit the Eastern Shores Marketing Phone Sex operation where they speak with the manager, Ed. [...] Ed tells them about a boyfriend of Angela's named Chris Novoselic (Dan Garrett) who used {{to spend time with}} her at an S club called 'The Eve of Destruction' on Fayette Street. [...] Pembleton and Bayliss go to the Eve of Destruction to question Novoselic. [...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you do that, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists everybody has a darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store and ask about leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss a leather jacket as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, O'Neal {{earned an}} MBA online through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In {{reference}} to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: [...] "It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else." ...|$|E
60|$|Any moment I {{might be}} {{stripped}} of my disguise. Any moment <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be the Ranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] {{said the}} Farmer, seeing the result; [...] "if that grain {{had not been}} heavily insured, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{dissemble}} my hatred of the Fox." ...|$|R
60|$|In short {{this will}} prove {{a month of}} great action, if <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> liberty <b>to</b> relate the particulars.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Harding {{answered}} shortly, [...] "I make none. If you {{had insisted}} on Miss Mowbray's marrying Brand, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> something <b>to</b> say. All I ask is that you give her a free choice; if she uses it to take somebody else, I won't complain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] {{she broke}} out indignantly, [...] "I'm not thinking--now--of what <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do without. Still, I {{suppose it was}} only natural that you should suspect it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Done? I cannot fancy it!' said Wilmet. 'Do you know, I {{believe it}} has been my bugbear for years past to think <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> persuade her to this?' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{twenty minutes}} later I saw Etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recast her horoscope, and try for a dark man coming with a bundle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} his Excellency was at the mission, or <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> ventured <b>to</b> offer him hospitality," [...] Don Luis remarked when the President was served.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} before I could stop him, and {{but for the}} fact that Silas came in {{immediately}} afterward, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> followed <b>to</b> learn what Hiram was about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! to be sure--the rhinoceros; yes, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} <b>to</b> {{find you}} in such low company, for `birds of a feather,' you know, {{are said to}} `flock together.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did your honour {{send for}} me," [...] he then inquired, [...] "to issue orders for this retreat, {{or was it}} your {{pleasure}} to hear anything <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{came to me}} yesterday, begging that I would waive any {{objection}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{your being}} there. I have made her no answer yet. What answer do you think I ought to make her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Waynefleet {{rose and}} turned to the girl. [...] "I'll put on my rubber overshoes," [...] he announced. [...] "As I {{mentioned}} that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go out, it's a pity you didn't think of laying out my coat to warm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'After all, though <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gone <b>to</b> him, {{it would}} have been useless. He is obstinate, and {{occasions}} of irritating his unfortunate temper are above all to be avoided.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might not}} hesitate, {{providing}} {{you could get}} me out of the carriage," [...] replied Jim, pertly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> say if you should attempt any interference." ...|$|R
6000|$|MINNIE. Why do {{you think}} that now? What changed you? Just because <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> helped <b>to</b> keep Mr. Pindar from being shot by a crazy man--that didn't change you, did it? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} from his book; his eyes were not cold or malevolent, his mouth was not cynical; he was ready and willing to hear what <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say: his spirit was of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunder-clap.|$|E
60|$|He fell silent, adding {{no comment}} of any sort, {{as if he}} waited to hear what of my own accord <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> urge. But my mind was {{incapable}} of travelling beyond the fact that I was {{to go out into}} the world to-morrow.|$|E
60|$|He {{could have}} nothing to object against an offer of this kind, {{because he could not}} guess what I meant, but gave me all the {{assurance}} of service and assistance that lay in his power in anything that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do in that country.|$|E
6000|$|... "I-- er-- I didn't {{know where}} he was stopping. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> telephoned <b>to</b> him. Although he <b>had</b> a right <b>to</b> stay away from here if he wanted to." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> {{find the}} right reading of this riddle, and tried in vain--but for Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite's death, which caused an inquiry to be made into the state of his affairs.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 November 2004, Cook was {{scheduled}} to face South African Phillip Ndou in defence of his IBO title. However, on 21 October 2004, Ndou retired suddenly after a brain scan revealed a slight abnormality. Ndou had previously challenged Floyd Mayweather Jr. for the WBC lightweight title. A disappointed Cook said of the proposed bout [...] "It {{would have been a}} great fight, I was thinking {{it could have been the}} British version of Hagler-Hearns. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick myself off the canvas in that one but I'd have definitely come back and eventually prevailed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My!" [...] exclaimed Danny Meadow Mouse, [...] "I'm glad I don't live in {{a country}} where <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make such long journeys. I don't envy those cousins up there in the Far North a bit. I'm {{perfectly}} satisfied to live right on the Green Meadows." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was upon}} {{the verge of}} the land of the Kaols that I now knew myself to be, but in what {{direction}} to search for Dejah Thoris, or how far {{into the heart of the}} great forest <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> penetrate I had not the faintest idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not rich," [...] I answered. [...] "Still, on the whole, I suppose for a {{bachelor}} I am comfortably off. Then my brother has no sons, and his health is always delicate. I do {{not count on}} that, of course, but <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> succeed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As a great awtust, yes," [...] said Beaton, {{mimicking}} her accent. [...] "If I {{were less}} than great <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> say about the arrangement of colors. You're as bold and original as Nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wife's sister's husband, Bert Adams, told me. His wife told 'im in strict confidence; and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>'ave</b> gone <b>to</b> {{my grave}} without knowing about it, only she smacked his face for 'im the other night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear? I <b>have</b> spoken <b>to</b> you, as <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> spoken <b>to</b> {{one of my}} own daughters, if she {{had been}} of your age. Tell me frankly, in return, whether I may count on your help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I win," [...] replied Halibut, with {{suspicious}} glibness, [...] "and was {{so upset}} that I had one of my bilious attacks come on, where should I be? Why, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> break off {{in the middle and}} go home. A fellow canâ€™t propose when everything in the room is going round and round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, men; {{here are}} {{footprints}} by {{the edge of}} the trees! Do not come out until I have carefully examined them. Do you not think," [...] he went on, turning to Frank, [...] "that it would be much better that you should not go further with me, for you see <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> call you as a witness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And did {{you notice}} his ears and his teeth, Mrs. Doctor, dear?" [...] queried Susan later on. [...] "He has got the nicest-shaped ears I ever saw on a man's head. I am choice about ears. When I was young I was scared that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> marry a man with ears like flaps. But I need not have worried, for never a chance did I have {{with any kind of}} ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|Twice I {{called him}} by his name, in the tone in which <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> rouse a sleeper, before he heeded me. When I at last inquired on what his {{thoughts}} were so bent, he replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;" [...] said Louise. [...] "I {{have the}} same prejudices as my cousin. If you hadn't been engaged for the harvest <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> listened <b>to</b> you; but that settles the matter definitely, as far as I am concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] I answered. [...] "We {{all of us}} have {{a certain}} amount of philosophy, you know, Louis. It was {{inevitable}} that when that man and I met, I should try to kill him. I had no weapon that night. I simply took him into my hands. But there, you know the rest. If he <b>had</b> died, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the penalty. It was a risk, but you see I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take it. The thing was inevitable. The wrong that he had done some one who is very dear to me was too terrible, too hideous, for him to be allowed to go unpunished." ...|$|R
