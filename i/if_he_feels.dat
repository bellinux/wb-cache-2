5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels,</b> deep down, {{that it is the}} wrong thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E
500|$|Some Eastern Catholic Churches {{are governed}} by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church, others are headed by a major archbishop, others are under a metropolitan, and others are {{organised}} as individual eparchies. [...] Each church has authority over the particulars of its internal organisation, liturgical rites, liturgical calendar {{and other aspects of}} its spirituality, subject only to the authority of the Pope. The Roman Curia has a specific department, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, to maintain relations with them. [...] The pope does not generally appoint bishops or clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches, deferring to their internal governance structures, but may intervene <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> it necessary.|$|E
500|$|When casting {{roles in}} his films, Refn does not watch casting tapes or have his actors {{audition}} for him. He meets {{with them and}} casts them on the spot <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> they're right. Drive was the first film Carey Mulligan signed on to do after being nominated for an Academy Award {{for her role in}} An Education (2009), which was directed by another Danish filmmaker, Lone Scherfig. (Scherfig is a good friend of Refn and used to babysit him when he was a child). At the time of Mulligan's casting, Refn had not seen An Education, but his wife was a big fan of the film and Mulligan's performance, and she urged him to cast her. In the original script, the character was a Hispanic woman named Irina. The character was changed to Irene after Mulligan was cast, with Refn explaining that he [...] "couldn’t find any actress that would click with [...] personally". While working on the film, Mulligan moved in with Refn, his wife and two daughters in their home in Los Angeles. Hossein Amini also lived with Refn's family {{for the duration of the}} film's shoot. Refn and Amini made significant changes to the original script during this time.|$|E

60|$|Dire sight {{it is to}} {{see some}} silken beast long dally with a golden lizard ere she devour.

Unwittingly I imp this cat-like thing, sporting with the heart of him who reads; for <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feel</b> not <b>he</b> reads in vain.|$|R

2500|$|If {{a player}} has only zero cards - 7, 8 or 9 of any suit, he {{may choose to}} force {{everyone}} to abandon this turn with no points to any team (Kawesh/Saneen), where he buys the public card as Sun, and lies his cards face up (<b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> he has an advantage he may still buy the card normally). However, in [...] "Second" [...] the player may not ask for this turn to be abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The Saint has a dark side, as he {{is willing}} to ruin the lives of the [...] "ungodly", and even kill them, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> that more {{innocent}} lives can be saved. In the early books, Templar refers to this as murder, although he considers his actions justified and righteous, a view usually shared by partners and colleagues. Several adventures centre on his intention to kill (for example, [...] "Arizona" [...] in The Saint Goes West has Templar planning to kill a Nazi scientist).|$|E

2500|$|Viewers became {{frustrated}} and angered by {{what seemed to}} be the writers situating a man into a lesbian love story, as well as Reese seeming to share more screentime and secrets with Zach than Bianca, and a lack of Reese and Bianca truly knowing each other. The audience had experienced sexual confusion storylines before with other former love interests of Bianca's, most notably Maggie, and were hoping that this love story would be without such confusion. At one point, Reese confesses to Zach her ambiguous feelings for him and asks him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> the same way for her just as [...] "the phone [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] the day".|$|E
2500|$|The NFLPA {{released}} a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions. The union lodged a formal grievance on May 4, contending that since the suspensions were for on-field misconduct, the players' appeals should be heard by Ted Cottrell and Art Shell, whom {{the collective bargaining agreement}} designates as the hearing officers for on-field sanctions. It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL special master Stephen Burbank in ruling on the players' actions. Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any [...] "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL," [...] a violation of Article 46 of the CBA. This provision is normally used to sanction off-field conduct. However, a league source told CBSSports.com's Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on in-game conduct <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> that it runs counter to the integrity of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Organizational {{rewards and}} job {{conditions}} play {{a large role}} in perceived organizational support as well. [...] Sometimes, extrinsic motivation can mean more to an employee than intrinsic motivation because perceived appreciation has the power to turn a bitter employee into a content employee. [...] Eisenberger and Rhoades discuss the many ways that employers can show appreciation and reward their employees. [...] A few examples are paying their employees fairly; recognizing their employees for new ideas, exceptional work, etc.; promoting their employees when they deserve it; providing job security as incentive to remain with the organization; encouraging autonomy to correspondingly increase production and morale; reduce stress when made aware of it; and to provide proper training, to ensure employees' confidence in their jobs. [...] Some of these factors carry less weight than others do. [...] Being autonomous increases an employee's desire to continue to remain loyal to his or her organization because <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> competent and confident in his ability to do well, he will be less likely to give up or lose faith.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, the {{practice}} of auricular confession was highly controversial within Anglicanism. When priests began to hear confessions, they responded to criticisms by pointing {{to the fact that}} such is explicitly sanctioned in The Order for the Visitation of the Sick in the Book of Common Prayer, which contains the following direction: Here shall the sick person be moved to make a special Confession of his sins, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>feel</b> his conscience troubled with any weighty matter. After which Confession, the Priest shall absolve him (<b>if</b> <b>he</b> humbly and heartily desire it).
