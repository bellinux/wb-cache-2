For this, the statistical connection analysis method is applied. The used variables are: the economic growth (gross domestic product - GDP) – considered dependent variable and the <b>gross</b> fixed <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> (GFCF) – considered independent variable. This workpaper uses the quarterly of GDP and GFCF, considering the period from {{the last quarter of}} 2003 until the last quarter of 2009. That analysis indicates the relation between those two indicators separately for each country in order to draw a conclusion regarding the role of GFCF to the growth and development of the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries and as well as its contribution to the formation of GDP. Using this data, we apply the correlation analysis to verify the existence of the connection between two macroeconomic indicators. The obtained results show a direct and strong connection between economic growth and <b>gross</b> fixed <b>capital</b> <b>formation,</b> relation which is expressed by correlation coefficient with a level very close to the value of 1 for Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Poland.

Globalization has many dimensions and with it a variety of social, political and economic implications. This paper examines the causal relationship between globalization and economic growth in Nigeria from 1981 to 2012. Time series data was used and sourced from the CBN Statistical Bulletin and Annual reports. The stationarity of the variables were tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root tests. They were found to be integrated of order I (1). Hence, the null hypotheses of having a unit root were rejected and all the series were used in our cointegration test after first difference. The variables used in the model were GDP, Financial integration, human resource development (HRD) and trade openness (OPEN). Cointegration result indicates the existence of a long run equilibrium relationship. The regression results show a positive and insignificant relationship between financial integration, human resource development and trade openness while <b>gross</b> fixed <b>capital</b> <b>formation</b> was negative and insignificant.
