It is observed that first five mode shapes of the individual <b>draft</b> pad are dominating the behaviour of each <b>draft</b> pad in the <b>draft</b> gear for all 15 mode shapes of the <b>draft</b> gear. This is because the <b>draft</b> pads housed in the <b>draft</b> gear have their own individual behaviour which cumulatively results in different mode shapes of the <b>draft</b> gear.

The vibration characteristics of individual <b>draft</b> pad are compared with <b>draft</b> pads that are part of <b>draft</b> gear. The modal analysis gives us a basis for subjecting a <b>draft</b> pad to higher frequency loading for determining its fatigue behaviour.|$|R
