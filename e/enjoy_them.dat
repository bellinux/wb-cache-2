5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also <b>enjoy</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|After the Meiji Restoration, {{various kinds}} of Western sports were {{introduced}} into Japan. Playing sports was adopted as a school activity and matches between universities became popular. During the 1870s, track and field events, baseball, football, rugby union, cricket and ice skating were introduced. In 1911, an Austrian gave skiing instruction to the Japanese army. In those days, Western sports were played by few people, but through the educational system they spread throughout the country. Western sports were initially stressed {{as a form of}} mental discipline, but Japanese have now come to <b>enjoy</b> <b>them</b> as recreational activities.|$|E
25|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor was {{published}} and developed by Atlus, namely {{by members of}} the recently acquired developer Career Soft. The game was designed so that newcomers of strategy games would <b>enjoy</b> <b>them.</b> Rather than simplifying the game system, Atlus mixed different gaming elements to create a new fighting system. Battles were designed so that players from previous Megami Tensei games would find it familiar. Features such as the Extra Turns provided by exploiting an enemy's weakness were based on classic Megami Tensei games. The game also reincorporates demons previously seen in the franchise while adding new ones with Kazuma Kaneko being responsible for the one known as Balder. The use of three characters per unit was designed to let the player try different combinations.|$|E
25|$|Supreme Court Holding, Clark v. C.C.N.V.(a) Assuming that {{overnight}} {{sleeping in}} connection with the demonstration is expressive conduct protected to some extent by the First Amendment, the regulation forbidding sleeping meets the requirements for a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction of expression, whether oral, written, or symbolized by conduct. The regulation is neutral with regard to the message presented, and leaves open ample alternative methods of communicating the intended message concerning the plight of the homeless. Moreover, the regulation narrowly focuses on the Government's substantial interest in maintaining the parks {{in the heart of the}} Capital in an attractive and intact condition, readily available to the millions of people who wish to see and <b>enjoy</b> <b>them</b> by their presence. To permit camping would be totally inimical to these purposes. The validity of the regulation need not be judged solely by reference to the demonstration at hand, and none of its provisions are unrelated to the ends that it was designed to serve.|$|E

25|$|The Empress Joséphine {{had her own}} {{favorite}} composer, the Italian Gaspare Spontini, {{who became}} her official composer of both historical dramas and comedies. Spontini's first lyrical work, La vestale, had a considerable success. His next work, Fernand Cortez, was commissioned when Napoleon decided to invade Spain, and celebrated the conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés. Unfortunately, the French army was defeated in Spain and Fernand Cortez was pulled from the repertoire, but it made a great impression on other French composers with its grand scenic effects, a Mexican ballet and a cavalry charge, its use of drums, and its huge chorus. Napoleon recreated {{the grandeur of the}} earlier royal court, constructing a new theater at the Tuileries Palace, which was finished in 1808. He also brought together an exceptional troupe of musicians and singers from Italy, including the composer Ferdinando Paër, who became master of his household music, the castrato Girolamo Crescentini, and the contralto Giuseppina Grassini. Napoleon did not allow applause in the hall during performances. The orchestra played a special air by André Grétry when Napoleon entered the theater, and the Vivat Imperator when he departed. But, because of his military campaigns, he was rarely in Paris to <b>enjoy</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to <b>enjoy</b> <b>them</b> with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

The little girls would <b>enjoy</b> <b>them,</b> and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China.

500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who are not interested in film noir themes will not <b>enjoy</b> <b>them</b> in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos with a dash of John Woo and a touch of Frank Miller." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Hills' {{concept of}} the [...] "cult blockbuster" [...] {{involves}} cult followings inside larger, mainstream films. [...] Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. [...] The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and fan works. [...] Hills identifies three different cult followings for The Lord of the Rings, each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream. [...] Academic Emma Pett identifies Back to the Future (1985) as {{another example of a}} cult blockbuster. [...] Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years. [...] The hammy acting by Christopher Lloyd and quotable dialogue draw a cult following, as they mimic traditional cult films. [...] Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts, such as The Matrix, allow cult film fans to <b>enjoy</b> <b>them</b> on a higher level than the mainstream. Star Wars, with its large cult following in geek subculture, has been cited as both a cult blockbuster and a cult film. [...] Although a mainstream epic, Star Wars has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream. [...] Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others. [...] For example, in the Star Wars film series, mainstream criticism of Jar Jar Binks focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing. [...] Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings. [...] They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both. [...] To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.|$|E
