This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous.</b>|$|E

Greene wrote that Alice's [...] "humanitarianism <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> in her world", and described her as [...] "so furiously at odds with herself" [...] because she is too immature to comprehend what is happening and her actions vary from being helpful to dangerous.|$|E

500|$|As {{with most}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{the plot of}} Trial by Jury <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous,</b> but the {{characters}} behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable. [...] This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions.

[...] Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire.

2500|$|Defenses of Hagel have {{included}} opinion pieces by writers Amy Davidson, Thomas Friedman, and Robert Wright, with Wright objecting {{to what he}} called [...] "McCarthyite" [...] smears against Hagel. Jeremy Ben-Ami, President of the liberal lobby group J Street, said: [...] "The notion that Chuck Hagel is anti-Israel <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous.</b> The notion that he is anti-Semitic is slanderous." [...] Harvard University Professor Stephen Walt, co-author of a 2007 book critical of the Israeli lobby wrote in Foreign Policy that [...] "The real meaning of the Hagel affair is what it says about the climate inside Washington. Simply put, {{the question is whether}} supine and reflexive support for all things Israeli remains a prerequisite for important policy positions here in the Land of the Free." ...|$|E

60|$|There is {{one final}} and {{complete}} {{answer to all}} such charges. It {{is that we have}} now in our hands 42,000 males of the Boer nations.

How are these admitted and certain facts compatible with any general refusal of quarter?

60|$|And so, no doubt, it had been. The very burlesque {{had grown}} {{from the way}} in which his young {{imagination}} had been moved by Scott's romance. He had felt from the time of those happy half-holidays in which he had been lucky enough to get hold of the novel, that according to all laws of poetic justice, Rebecca, as being the more beautiful and the more interesting of the heroines, was entitled to the possession of the hero. We have all of us felt the same. But to him had been present at the same time all that <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> in our ideas of middle-age chivalry; the absurdity of its recorded deeds, the blood-thirstiness of its recreations, the selfishness of its men, the falseness of its honour, the cringing of its loyalty, the tyranny of its princes. And so there came forth Rebecca and Rowena, all broad fun from beginning to end, but never without a purpose,--the best burlesque, as I think, in our language.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} of whether miracles ever occur is a {{question of}} common sense and of ordinary historical imagination: not of any final physical experiment. One may here surely dismiss that quite brainless piece of pedantry which talks about the need for [...] "scientific conditions" [...] in connection with alleged spiritual phenomena. If we are asking whether a dead soul can communicate with a living it <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> to insist that it shall be under conditions in which no two living souls in their senses would seriously communicate with each other. The fact that ghosts prefer darkness no more disproves the existence of ghosts than the fact that lovers prefer darkness disproves the existence of love. If you choose to say, [...] "I will believe that Miss Brown called her fiance a periwinkle or, any other endearing term, if she will repeat the word before seventeen psychologists," [...] then I shall reply, [...] "Very well, if those are your conditions, you will never get the truth, for she certainly will not say it." [...] It is just as unscientific as it is unphilosophical to be surprised that in an unsympathetic atmosphere certain extraordinary sympathies do not arise. It is as if I said that I could not tell if there was a fog because the air was not clear enough; or as if I insisted on perfect sunlight in order to see a solar eclipse.|$|E
6000|$|Roderick, {{apart from}} [...] "black ivory," [...] is aided by his uncle and his long lost father. The base world, in the persons of Strap, Thompson, the uncle, Mr. Sagely, and other people, treats him {{infinitely}} {{better than he}} deserves. His very love (as always in Smollett) is only an animal appetite, vigorously insisted upon by the author. By a natural reaction, Scott, much as he admired Smollett, introduced his own blameless heroes, and even Thackeray could only hint at the defects of youth, in [...] "Esmond." [...] Thackeray is accused of making his good people stupid, or too simple, or eccentric, and otherwise contemptible. Smollett went further: Strap, a model of benevolence, <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> and a coward; even Bowling has the stage eccentricities of the sailor. Mankind was certain, in the long run, to demand heroes more amiable and worthy of respect. Our inclinations, as Scott says, are with [...] "the open-hearted, good-humoured, and noble-minded Tom Jones, whose libertinism (one particular omitted) is perhaps rendered but too amiable by his good qualities." [...] To be sure Roderick does befriend [...] "a reclaimed street-walker" [...] in her worst need, but why make her the confidante of the virginal Narcissa? Why reward Strap with her hand? Fielding decidedly, as Scott insists, [...] "places before us heroes, and especially heroines, of a much higher {{as well as more}} pleasing character, than Smollett was able to present." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § XXIX. There is, however, a less criminal, though hardly less {{dangerous}} condition of mind; which, though not failing in its more urgent duties, fails in the finer conscientiousness which regulates the degree, and directs the choice, of amusement, {{at those times}} when amusement is allowable. The most frequent error in this respect is the want of reverence in approaching subjects of importance or sacredness, and of caution in the expression of thoughts which may encourage like irreverence in others: and these faults are apt to gain upon the mind until it becomes habitually more sensible to what <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> and accidental, than to what is grave and essential, in any subject that is brought before it; or even, at last, desires to perceive or to know nothing but what may end in jest. Very generally minds of this character are active and able; {{and many of them}} are so far conscientious, that they believe their jesting forwards their work. But it is difficult to calculate the harm they do, by destroying the reverence which is our best guide into all truth; for weakness and evil are easily visible, but greatness and goodness are often latent; and we do infinite mischief by exposing weakness to eyes which cannot comprehend greatness. This error, however, is more connected with abuses of the satirical than of the playful instinct; and I shall have more to say of it presently.|$|E
6000|$|... (7.) Assume no false appearances, in your school, {{either as}} to {{knowledge}} or character. Perhaps it may justly {{be said to}} be the common practice of teachers in this country, to affect dignity of deportment in the presence of their pupils, which, in other cases, is laid aside; and to pretend to superiority in knowledge, and an infallibility of judgment, which no sensible man would claim before other sensible men, but which an absurd fashion seems to require of the teacher. It can however scarcely {{be said to be}} a fashion, for the temptation is almost exclusively confined to the young and the ignorant, who think they must make up by appearance, what they want in reality. Very few of the older, and more experienced, and successful instructers in our country, fall into it at all. But some young beginner, whose knowledge is very limited, and who, in manner and habits, has only just ceased to be a boy, walks into his school-room with a countenance of forced gravity, and with a dignified and solemn step, which <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> even to himself. I describe accurately, for I describe from recollection. This unnatural, and forced, and ludicrous dignity, cleaves to him like disease, through the whole period of his duty. In the presence of his scholars, he is always under restraint,--assuming a stiff, and formal dignity, which is as ridiculous as it is unnatural. He is also obliged to resort to arts which are certainly not very honorable, to conceal his ignorance.|$|E
6000|$|The king {{called his}} daughter-in-law “cette diablesse madame la princesse”. The frequenters of the latter’s Court were {{forbidden}} to appear at the king’s: their royal highnesses going to Bath, we read how the courtiers followed them thither, and paid that homage in Somersetshire which was forbidden in London. That phrase of “cette diablesse madame la princesse” explains one cause of the wrath of her royal papa. She was a very clever woman: she had {{a keen sense of}} humour: she had a dreadful tongue: she turned into ridicule the antiquated sultan and his hideous harem. She wrote savage letters about him home to members of her family. So, driven out from the royal presence, the prince and princess set up for themselves in Leicester Fields, “where,” says Walpole, “the most promising of the young gentlemen of the next party, and the prettiest and liveliest of the young ladies, formed the new Court.” Besides Leicester House, they had their lodge at Richmond, frequented by some of the pleasantest company of those days. There were the Herveys, and Chesterfield, and little Mr. Pope from Twickenham, and with him, sometimes, the savage Dean of St. Patrick’s, and quite a bevy of young ladies, whose pretty faces smile on us out of history. There was Lepell, famous in ballad song; and the saucy, charming Mary Bellenden, who would have none of the Prince of Wales’s fine compliments, who folded her arms across her breast, and bade H.R.H. keep off; and knocked his purse of guineas into his face, and told him she was tired of seeing him count them. He was not an august monarch, this Augustus. Walpole tells how, one night at the royal card-table, the playful princesses pulled a chair away from under Lady Deloraine, who, in revenge, pulled the king’s from under him, so that his Majesty fell on the carpet. In whatever posture one sees this royal George, he <b>is</b> <b>ludicrous</b> somehow; even at Dettingen, where he fought so bravely, his figure is absurd—calling out in his broken English, and lunging with his rapier, like a fencing-master. In contemporary caricatures, George’s son, “the Hero of Culloden,” is also made an object of considerable fun, as witness the following picture of him defeated by the French (1757) at Hastenbeck: ...|$|E
