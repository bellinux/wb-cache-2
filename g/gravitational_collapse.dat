5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse,</b> releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole.

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> to form a black hole. According to {{classical}} physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse,</b> {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse.</b> The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{this new}} {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, what they considered a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total energy output for 107 years. They decided to call this new class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E

Since the energy density, pressure, and tension of the primordial magnetic field affect <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapses</b> of plasma, the formation of seeds for large scale structures should be influenced by them. Here we numerically investigate the effects of stochastic primordial magnetic field on the seeds of large scale structures in the universe in detail.

The neutron stars are modeled by a polytropic {{equation of state}} (EOS) with polytropic index Γ= 2 without the ultra-relativistic assumption. Further, the critical collapse can result from a slow change of the EOS, without fine tuning of initial data. This suggests that critical collapses could actually occur in nature. There {{is evidence that the}} critical solution, as well as the mode that brings the near critical solution away from the critical one, are spherical symmetric, despite that the initial data is highly non-spherical...|$|R
40|$|It is {{expected}} that black holes are formed dynamically under the <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapses</b> and approach to the stationary states. In this paper, we show that the asymptotic Killing vector at late time should exist on the horizon and then {{that it can be}} extended to the out of black holes under the assumption of the analyticity of spacetimes. This fact implies that if there is another asymptotic Killing vector which becomes stationary Killing at far region and spacelike in "ergoregion", the rotating black holes may have the asymptotically axisymmetric Killing vector at late time. Thus, we may expect that the asymptotic rigidity of the black holes holds. Comment: 12 pages, published version in PR...|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} (G2V) {{based on its}} {{spectral}} class. As such, it is informally {{referred to as a}} yellow dwarf.

Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} cusp singularities in f(R) gravity, {{especially for}} Starobinsky and Hu-Sawicki dark energy models. We illustrate that, by using double-null numerical simulations, a cusp singularity can {{be triggered by}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapses.</b> This singularity can be cured by adding a quadratic term, but this causes a Ricci scalar bump that can be observed by an observer outside the event horizon. Comparing with cosmological parameters, it seems {{that it would be}} difficult to see super-Planckian effects by astrophysical experiments. On the other hand, at once there exists a cusp singularity, it can be a mechanism to realize a horizon scale curvature singularity that can be interpreted by a firewall.

With this set-up, the central singularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the cloud starts expanding. Motivated by {{the fact that in the}} classical case homogeneous and inhomogeneous collapse models have different properties, here we extend our previous work to the inhomogeneous case. As in the quantum-inspired homogeneous collapse model, the classical central singularity is replaced by a bounce, but the inhomogeneities strongly affect the structure of the bounce curve and of the trapped region.

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapse</b> from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E

In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
40|$|Unitarity of {{evolution}} in <b>gravitational</b> <b>collapses</b> implies existence of macroscopic stable horizonless objects. With such objects in mind, we study {{the effects of}} anisotropy of pressures on the stability of stars. We consider stars in four or higher dimensions and also stars in M theory made up of (intersecting) branes. Taking the stars to be static, spherically symmetric and the equations of state to be linear, we study `singular solutions' and the asymptotic perturbations around them. Oscillatory perturbations are likely to imply instability. We find that non oscillatory perturbations, which may imply stability, are possible if an appropriate amount of anisotropy is present. This result suggests that {{it may be possible to}} have stable horizonless objects in four or any higher dimensions, and that anisotropic pressures may play a crucial role in ensuring their stability.
