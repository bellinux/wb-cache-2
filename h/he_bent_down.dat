500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the banquet}} had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, {{early in the}} morning in {{carriages}} where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as [...] "sowing the Fyrisvellir"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{to look at}} them and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from the}} table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> {{suddenly}} <b>down</b> to Jerry, who {{was standing}} as close against his legs as he could, so close that his wet forepaws rested on Skipper's bare feet.|$|R
60|$|Ayacanora {{looked up}} in his face inquiringly: {{but before she could}} speak again, <b>he</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> and lifting her as the lion lifts the lamb, pressed her to his bosom, and covered her face with kisses.|$|R
2500|$|... 53 Then each of {{them went}} home, 1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early {{in the morning he}} came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{from the}} landing over Razumov, who had lowered his eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{touched the}} {{electric}} bell. Taking her hands, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed them.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tartar {{waved his}} right hand as <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> his head <b>down</b> over Rosa, talking in an {{animated}} way.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> eagerly <b>down</b> on one knee, {{and gazed}} intently at the smoke, which was rolling up the chimney {{in a thick}} black cloud. John Willet, who {{appeared}} to consider himself particularly and chiefly referred to under the term wise men, looked that way likewise, and with great solidity of feature.|$|R
60|$|In another moment, however, {{she found}} herself in the state of being {{released}} from him; some one was taking him from her, though <b>he</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.|$|R
60|$|And as he spoke, <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> and detached, gently enough, a {{magnificent}} necklace.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{his head}} and kissed her forehead: she pressed his {{faithful}} hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{and kissed}} her, {{and neither of}} them ever remembered exactly what they said.|$|E
60|$|Annie huddled {{into the}} dressing-gown, Paul wrapped {{himself in a}} brown blanket. It was three o'clock. He mended the fire. Then the two sat waiting. The great, snoring breath was taken--held awhile--then given back. There was a space--a long space. Then they started. The great, snoring breath was taken again. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> close <b>down</b> and looked at her.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{before she}} could {{say a word to}} arrest him he was at her side. [...] "Don't!" [...] she said, weakly, as <b>he</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and put one arm about her and seized her hands with his {{disengaged}} hand and kissed her--kissed her almost upon her lips. He seemed to do ten things {{before she could}} think to do one, to leap upon her and take possession.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you see, I couldn't {{leave me}} harsses, sor," [...] said the coachman. [...] "What's he wants, sor?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> urbanely <b>down</b> from his box {{and listened to}} the {{explanation}} that Westover made him, standing in the cold on the curbstone, with one hand on the carriage door. [...] "Then it's no use, sor," [...] the man decided. [...] "Whin he's that way, ahl hell couldn't stir um. Best go back, sor, and try to find the gentleman." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> {{carefully}} {{looking at}} the little, thin, wounded knee of the child. Egbert bent over him.|$|E
60|$|They stood {{facing each}} other. The dog {{walked away from}} her to him. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to it.|$|E
60|$|Papa whistled softly, {{although}} {{his face was}} grave; and then <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed his little girl's forehead.|$|E
6000|$|Presently <b>he</b> {{came and}} <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> over her, {{to put a}} piece of paper into her hand. [...] "You will receive {{something}} in return, you are aware, my Romola?" [...] he said, gently, not minding so much what had passed, now he was secure; and feeling able to try and propitiate her.|$|R
60|$|Then the Jogi, being a cunning man, {{fell into}} his own net. As <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> him <b>down</b> to salute the goddess, Vikram, drawing his sword, struck him upon the neck so violent a blow, that his head rolled from his body upon the ground. At the same moment Dharma Dhwaj, seizing his father's arm, pulled {{him out of the}} way in time to escape being crushed by the image, which fell with the sound of thunder upon the floor of the temple.|$|R
2500|$|Southall rail crash — on 19 September 1997, a Great Western Trains InterCity 125 {{operating}} a service from Swansea to London Paddington failed {{to stop at}} a red signal and collided with a freight train entering Southall goods yard.

60|$|Again {{he started}} {{as if he}} were shot. She was speaking. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> but did not look at her.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{and whispered}} to her a bridegroom's compliment, which brought the blood back to her cheek in an instant.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> a little. His sleeve {{brushed against}} her shoulder. Something {{in his face}} arrested the answer she meant to make.|$|E

6000|$|When {{they had}} gone a bi of the way, {{they came to a}} path with high trees on each side.

6000|$|Sparks' {{first impulse}} was to knock the quiet man down and fly, but he felt a {{restraining}} power on his other arm, and, looking round, observed a tall policeman at his side. As if by magic, another tall policeman appeared in front of him, and a third behind him. <b>He</b> suddenly <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> his head and suffered himself to be led away.

[...] They met a few minutes later at a well-known rendezvous.|$|R
6000|$|Cole {{came toward}} them. <b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> a little. The beam from the guide-light crossed his features. Lean, {{prominent}} nose, beak-like, faded blue eyes-- ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the second}} time <b>he</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and took her hands and kissed them. Then she went alone into the silent church, and prayed.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> for {{a closer}} inspection, and {{inserted}} a finger through the railings. Erb abandoned his customary taciturnity and spoke words of warning.|$|E
6000|$|Young Sigtryg half {{started from}} his feet: but when Hereward smiled at him, and laid {{his finger on}} his lips, he sat down again. Hereward felt his {{shoulder}} touched from behind.

60|$|While {{this was}} in process a man entered with a loud Good evening. We replied Good-evening--and evidently he caught a strange note. <b>He</b> came and <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and peered under my hat-brim, then under the q-b's hat-brim, we still wore hats and overcoats, as did everybody. Then he stood up {{suddenly}} and touched his cap and said Scusi--excuse me. I said Niente, which one always says, and he addressed a few jovial words to the crouching roaster: who again would hardly answer him. The omnibus was arrived from Oristano, I made out--with few passengers.|$|R
