25|$|In {{terms of}} institutions, the two {{autonomous}} water sector institutions {{created in the}} 1959 had been merged into the Natural Resources Authority in 1965, but this overly centralized arrangement including non-water functions such as mining did not prove to be successful. Therefore, in a further institutional shift, in 1973 three new organizations were created, <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> law: The Amman Water and Sewer Authority (AWSA), the Drinking Water Supply Corporation (DWSC) in charge of water supply in the areas outside the capital, and the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC). In the meantime, Jordan’s population had grown to 1.5 million because of natural growth and the influx of Palestinian refugees in 1967. The growing capital ran out of water and its supply became intermittent. In order to overcome the shortage, the Cabinet approved two projects in 1977: The first was {{the construction of a}} carrier from Deiralla in the Jordan Valley to pump drinking water to Amman, and the second was the construction of a carrier from the Azraq oasis east of the capital. Both projects were completed in the 1980s. At the same time, it was decided to reuse treated wastewater from Amman for irrigation in the Jordan Valley to compensate for the loss of freshwater.|$|E

60|$|But {{these two}} harpoons, <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> cord, are both {{connected}} with the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already {{connected with the}} line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{one hour}} after midnight, and the {{prospect}} around was lovely. The grey old towers of the ruin, partly entire, partly broken, here bearing the rusty weather-stains of ages, and there partially mantled with ivy, stretched along the verge of the dark rock which rose on Mannering's right hand. In his front was the quiet bay, whose little waves, crisping and sparkling to the moonbeams, rolled successively along its surface, and dashed with a soft and murmuring ripple against the silvery beach. To the left the woods advanced far into the ocean, waving in the moonlight along ground of an undulating and varied form, and presenting those varieties of light and shade, and that interesting combination of glade and thicket, upon which the eye delights to rest, charmed with what it sees, yet curious to pierce still deeper into {{the intricacies of the}} woodland scenery. Above rolled the planets, <b>each,</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> liquid orbit of light, distinguished from the inferior or more distant stars. So strangely can imagination deceive even those by whose volition it has been excited, that Mannering, while gazing upon these brilliant bodies, was half inclined to believe in the influence ascribed to them by superstition over human events. But Mannering was a youthful lover, and might perhaps be influenced by the feelings so exquisitely expressed by a modern poet:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|And yet, {{what seems}} more {{pertinent}} to note here, {{there is a}} stillness, not of unobstructed growth, but of passive inertness, and symptom of imminent downfall. As victory is silent, so is defeat. Of the opposing forces the weaker has resigned itself; the stronger marches on, noiseless now, but rapid, inevitable: the fall and overturn will not be noiseless. How all grows, and has its period, even as the herbs of the fields, be it annual, centennial, millennial! All grows and dies, <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> wondrous laws, in wondrous fashion of its own; spiritual things most wondrously of all. Inscrutable, to the wisest, are these latter; not to be prophesied of, or understood.

Of such it may be affirmed even that the superficial aspect, that the inward feeling of full health, is generally ominous. For indeed it is of apoplexy, so to speak, and a plethoric lazy habit of body, that Churches, Kingships, Social Institutions, oftenest die. Sad, when such Institution plethorically says to itself, Take thy ease, thou hast goods laid up;--like the fool of the Gospel, to whom it was answered, Fool, this night thy life shall be required of thee! ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the people}} within reach had {{suspended}} their business, or their idleness, {{to run to}} the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that {{there might have been a}} scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.|$|E

5000|$|Georges Dumézil's trifunctional {{hypothesis}} {{proposed that}} ancient Indo-European society conceived itself as structured around three activities: worship, war, and toil.

Dumézil understood this mythology as reflecting and validating social structures in its content: such a tripartite class system is found in ancient Indian, Iranian, Greek and Celtic texts. In 1970 Dumézil proposed that some goddesses represented these three qualities as different aspects or epithets and identified examples in his interpretation of various deities including the Iranian Anāhitā, the Vedic Sarasvatī and the Roman Juno.|$|E

40|$|Logic-level {{simulation}} {{is still}} one of the most often used operations on digital designs during both design and test stages. This makes it a critical issue affecting the overall cost of a project. In this paper we investigate and show the origins of common advantages of four recently proposed efficient simulation methods of different classes: logic simulation, multi-valued simulation, timing simulation, and fault simulation. Described advantages became possible due to use of a highly efficient model called Structurally Synthesized Binary Decision Diagrams (SSBDD). This very compact model preserves the structural information about the modeled circuit and utilizes circuit partitioning into a set of macros represented <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> SSBDD. All this makes the SSBDD model a good choice as a logic-level digital design representation. The analysis is made on the basis of experimental data acquired using ISCAS' 85 benchmark circuits...|$|E

This work {{reviews the}} chordophones of the harp and lyre {{categories}} and their use in the whole Ancient Near East, including Egypt. The structure of each chapter reflects the undertaken methodology: Each chapter opens with a review of available primary and secondary sources; it is divided in separate sections with archaeological and literary material. The review is followed by discussion of the social, religious and symbolic role of a harp in the given culture. Egypt, as well as Israel/Palestine region, is covered <b>each</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> chapter; Mesopotamia, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia are discussed together in single chapter. In Egypt, the harp play developed in immemorial tradition strongly anchored to the cult, as we can deduce from pictorial relics. Apart from the paintings depicting harp on religious occasions, it was portrayed (almost exclusively) during ceremonies of both intimate and public character. Other studied cultures offer much more wealth of information on their musical aspect. Mesopotamia developed musical notation, large number of sources give sound evidence for significant role of harp and lyre in the cult.
