5|$|As {{with all}} the songs on Biophilia, an app was made for the song, which {{features}} a video game in which the player <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> geological layers as an accordion to play chords. Though the song wasn't released as a single, a music video was produced, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang. The video was critically applauded and received further attention when it got projected for one month in Times Square in 2013, and then across the 7 continents. Björk promoted the song by performing it throughout her Biophilia Tour.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E

5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

Skybus highly discouraged connections; as such, passengers wishing to interchange at hubs would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> bags between flights (on their own) as bags could not be checked on a multi-segment itinerary.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} {{chains of}} stretched rubber {{are susceptible to}} crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{out of the way}} of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.|$|E

25|$|The rockoon (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) was a {{solid fuel}} rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.|$|E
25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually {{occur in the}} evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients feel like they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, {{this can lead to}} insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.|$|E

25|$|Because of the shallowness of the Tyne, {{the use of}} coal staiths did {{not entirely}} {{eliminate}} the need for keels. The amount that the staiths projected into the river was limited so as not to obstruct river traffic, so that the staiths ended in shallow water. As colliers were loaded their draught would deepen until often they were no longer able to continue loading from the staiths. In such cases the colliers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into deeper water and the loading would be completed using keels.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{maintained}} a mechanized infantry brigade in West Germany from the 1950s (originally the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade, later named 4 Combat Group and 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade) to the 1990s {{as part of}} Canada's NATO commitments. This brigade was {{maintained a}}t close to full strength and was equipped with Canada's most advanced vehicles and weapons systems as it was anticipated the brigade might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> quickly {{in the event of}} a Warsaw Pact invasion of the west. The Royal Canadian Air Force established No. 1 Air Division in the early 1950s to meet Canada's NATO air defence commitments in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth's {{mother died}} in 1828, and is buried at St Michael's Church, Ledbury, next to her {{daughter}} Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth's aunt, helped {{to care for the}} children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth's strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|White {{has a few}} pawn moves {{which do}} not lose material, but {{eventually}} he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> one of his pieces. If he plays 1.Rc1 or Rd1, then 1...Re2 traps White's queen; 1.Kh2 fails to 1...R5f3, also trapping the queen, since White cannot play 2.Bxf3 because the bishop is pinned to the king; 1.g4 runs into 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3? Rh2 mate. Angos analyzes 1.a3 a5 2.axb4 axb4 3.h4 Kh8 (waiting) 4.b3 Kg8 and White has run out of waiting moves and must lose material. Best in this line is 5.Nc3!? bxc3 6.bxc3, which just leaves Black with a serious positional advantage and an extra pawn. Other moves lose material in more obvious ways.|$|E
25|$|The antenna {{for such}} a system {{would have to be}} large only in the {{horizontal}} direction, and could be very thin vertically. This had advantages for installation on aircraft, but it would be even more practical if the beam could be steered electronically, as opposed to mechanically. By delaying the signal slightly as it travelled down the long antenna, which could be arranged through a number of means, the phase angle would vary, causing the resulting signal to be focussed in a given direction. Since the antenna didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in order to scan, this led to the possibility of embedding the antenna in the leading edges of the aircraft wings, or similar solutions.|$|E
25|$|This {{extraordinary}} strong {{frequency dependence}} {{can be explained}} by the different distances the ions <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E

Returning to the US, he informed the Cuban-Americans with whom he was liaising that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their base of operations from Florida to Mexico City, because the State Department refused to permit the training of a militia on US soil. Although unhappy with the news, they conceded to the order.|$|E
25|$|Most dung beetles {{search for}} dung using their {{sensitive}} sense of smell. Some smaller species simply attach {{themselves to the}} dung-providers {{to wait for the}} dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male Onthophagus taurus beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.|$|E
25|$|From 1997 {{the flights}} were made subject {{to public service}} obligations. Widerøe won the first three-year contract. In the second contest in September 1999, Coast Air won the Florø contract. It {{introduced}} their two 46-seat ATR 42–300 aircraft. This caused Widerøe to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their base from Florø to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The company received NOK51 million annually, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2003. The bid was about NOK100 million lower than from Widerøe. All stopovers were thereby dropped. Coast Air flew four or five daily trips to both Bergen and Oslo. The demand for air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 passengers flew with Coast Air to Florø, instead of the estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company.|$|E
