25|$|His {{music is}} marked by lyricism {{interrupted}} by sudden dynamic contrasts. Not only did he write prolifically for the piano, he was an important composer for the harp. His music for that instrument contains {{a great variety of}} figuration within a largely diatonic harmony, avoids dangerous chromatic passages and is eminently playable. His concerto writing <b>is</b> <b>exciting.</b> His music is considered standard repertoire for all harpists, particularly his Six Sonatas/Sonatinas and especially the Sonata in C minor. Less well known to the general public than that of his more renowned Classical period contemporaries, his piano music is highly valued by many teachers and not infrequently programmed. Franz Liszt has been called an indirect successor of Dussek in the composition and performance of virtuoso piano music. His music remained popular to some degree in 19th-century Great Britain and the USA, and some of it is still in print, with much more becoming available in period editions found online.|$|E

Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E
500|$|Seekers has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive.

[...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story <b>is</b> <b>exciting</b> and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is fast paced, and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot. In a review for the second and third books, Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain, but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{classified}} Fantasy Black Channel {{into the}} British New Rave genre and musical scene. Others {{claimed that they}} could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and musician Gary Numan in the recording. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder commented that it contains several New Rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of PopMatters claimed that the band members [...] "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album <b>is</b> <b>exciting</b> and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to Klaxons and New Rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members tried not to listen to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of The Skinny {{pointed out that the}} record is [...] "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of Queen and Bowie to the primitive electronics of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern house".|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film.

People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that <b>is</b> <b>exciting</b> and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E
500|$|The music, Lang says, flows [...] "beguilingly" [...] {{from the}} spacious overture; the quieter, {{emotional}} passages are illustrated evocatively, {{while in the}} more spectacular moments Handel's innovative use of brass <b>is</b> <b>exciting</b> and inspiring. The sudden blast of trumpets which announces the Act 3 March provides, say Dean and Knapp, [...] "an effect of splendour and exhilaration that time has not dimmed". The harpsichord solos which decorate [...] "Vo' far guerra" [...] in Act 2 were originally improvised on the keyboard by Handel during performances, and were extremely popular. They were remembered and written down by William Babell, and published later as separate pieces. Lang believes {{that in spite of}} the borrowings, and the hasty manner in which the work was put together, Rinaldo is one of Handel's great operas. According to Dean and Knapp, no Italian opera heard in London to that point had been supported by such [...] "majestic" [...] orchestral forces. Critic Anthony Hicks describes the music, overall, as both [...] "varied and excellent". Dean and Knapp's verdict is more equivocal. The music for the war and pageantry scenes, they say, is [...] "brilliantly successful", but in depicting the scenes concerned with magic, Handel misses the mark; they suggest it was not until over 15 years later, with Admeto and Orlando, {{that he was able to}} represent the supernatural convincingly in music.|$|E

500|$|The Martian was {{directed}} by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir's 2011 novel of same name. 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film. The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film, and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay {{and the opportunity to}} work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved. Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed, telling Creative Screenwriting, [...] "When it's Scott, collaboration is easy because I just revere him.

Though he said it was remarkably silent on intellectual property law and the implications for society of a world in which most of the increase in output comes from catch-up growth from poor countries.

[...] "A small book but a big, worthwhile question", concluded The Economist. In the New York Times, David Brooks praised The Great Stagnation as [...] "the most debated non-fiction book so far this year", which Timothy Noah described as a great favor to the book's marketing though an exaggeration considering the discussion surrounding Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua.|$|E
