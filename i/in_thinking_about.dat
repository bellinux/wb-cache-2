Evans was attempting a radical shift <b>in</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E

25|$|Jane Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a {{sustained}} critique of urban planning {{as it had}} developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity <b>in</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and disadvantaged groups (Goodchild 1990). It {{is important to note}} that urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).|$|E

In her article discussing the use of paratext, or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, Deborah Bowen argues that the novel's paratext forces the reader, like in other postmodern works, to rethink the importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements can distract from the effectiveness of the novel and challenging the authority of the narrative voice.|$|E
500|$|Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish gestalt {{psychologist}} and pioneer in social psychology in the United States. He created seminal pieces {{of work in}} impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. [...] His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only {{greater than the sum}} of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error <b>in</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" [...] (Asch, 1952, p.61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{globalization}} in {{the past}} thirty years, {{the power of the}} unskilled worker has diminished, and thus, the informal economy has flourished. In Latin America, there is an abundant number of workers to help out with domestic work, and consequently, domestic service is cheap, diminishing the family tensions surrounding the issue of domestic work. Currently, about half of the working population is employed in the informal sector, leading to [...] "unemployment, underemployment, and social exclusion". Because of this, there has been a serious delay in providing welfare for the care of children and the elderly, because the pressure to provide aid for working families is minimal. In addition, domestic workers, many of them women, often leave their countries to work in the informal sector in northern countries in order to increase income for their families, also delaying the pressure for governments to provide aid to these families. However, there has been a change since the 2000s <b>in</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> unpaid work due to the influx of paid jobs for women and the shortage of people available to do domestic work.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] <b>in</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I know right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that.

Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff.
