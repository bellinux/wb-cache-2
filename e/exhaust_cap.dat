50|$|First {{offered in}} early 2011, but {{still part of}} the 2011 model year, Triumph debuted the Daytona 675R. The 675R did not feature any changes to the engine, instead Triumph's focus was on the {{standard}} inclusion of Brembo front brakes, Ã–hlins suspension, and Triumph's quickshifter. The 675R has carbon fiber front mudguard, rear hugger, <b>exhaust</b> <b>cap,</b> heat shield, and cockpit infill panels.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 Daytona 675 Special Edition has {{the same}} Pearl White {{bodywork}} and Blue frame as the 2010 model, but also included as standard carbon fiber replacements for the cockpit infill panels, exhaust heat shield, <b>exhaust</b> <b>cap,</b> and rear hugger as well as Triumph's aftermarket adjustable levers. Unlike the 2010 SE, the 2011 SE also includes the updated gauge cluster first found in the standard 2010 model, {{as well as a}} new racing-inspired decal design.|$|E
5000|$|Greenwell {{was found}} in his {{chambers}} dead from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. A handwritten will was found near the body. According to Nueces County Sheriff Jim Kaelin, the judge faced financial ruin. He had <b>exhausted</b> spending <b>caps</b> on five credit cards and owed the repayment of loans. Kaelin said that Greenwell earned at least $140,000 annually but did not apparently live extravagantly. Investigators are looking into possible blackmail or extortion attempts against the judge. [...] A memorial service was to be held on July 25, 2013 at the First United Methodist Church in Corpus Christi.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, a new 225ci slant six {{replaced}} the 251ci six used in 1961 & 1962 W100 & W200 Power Wagon Trucks. The Power Wagon W300 {{continued to use}} the 251ci. L-6 engine. The new 225ci engine (the 225-2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to; a roller timing chain, bi-metal connecting rod bearings, stellite-faced <b>exhaust</b> valves, roto <b>caps</b> on <b>exhaust</b> valves and polyacrylic valve stem seals.|$|R
5000|$|For 2010, Kawasaki made {{significant}} revisions including adding KTRC traction control and K-ACT ABS and brake assist, {{as well as}} linked brakes which are optional in some markets and standard in others. The 2010 model also has revised bodywork to improve engine cooling and reduce engine heat to the rider, mirrors raised by 40 mm, the dashbord top was redesigned with vents to help relieve back pressure, a larger wind screen and with memory function and auto-lowering, a heat shield across the midsection of the exhaust pipe, a handlebar-mounted switch to control the dash computer, variable heated grips, an optional [...] "Fuel Economy Assistance Mode" [...] that tells the ECU to use a leaner, more economical air-fuel ratio at engine speeds less than 6,000 rpm and road speed less than 80 mph, an [...] "Economical Riding Indicator" [...] {{was added to the}} dashboard. The tank-mounted storage area was removed and replaced with an auto-locking glove box in the left fairing, the <b>exhaust</b> silencer <b>cap</b> was changed, the two color seat was replaced a single color model, the instrument cluster illumination was changed from red to white, an ambient outdoor temperature display option was added to the computer display, included key sets were changed from two active fobs/keys to one active fob/key and one passive mini fob/key, the front fork fluid levels were increased by 25ml, and the oil pan was modified so that the drain plug faces forward instead of downward to prevent damage. The ECU was programmed to limit top speed to 154 mph. The rear pannier covers were fully painted (instead of leaving a black area at the bottom). Many people refer to the 2010+ models as the 2nd generation (or [...] "Gen 2") of the C14. Color options of Candy Neptune Blue for USA/Europe and Metallic Magnesium Gray for Europe.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2010. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: David B. Kittelson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF);vii, 56 pages; appendices A-D. A {{diesel particulate filter}} (DPF) {{can be used to}} reduce the particulate matter (PM) emissions from a vehicle. However, when these devices fail the tailpipe emissions can change. The main goal of this project was to determine if a soot sensor provided by Honeywell could detect a failed filter, defined as an exhaust aerosol concentration downstream of the DPF greater than the current US heavy duty PM standard of 13 mg/kWh (10 mg/bhp-hr). In this study a DPF failure was first simulated on an engine dynamometer test stand using an exhaust bypass valve. Then the valve was removed and the filter was actually failed in a series of steps by drilling out individual channel end <b>caps.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> was cooled and diluted using a partial flow air ejector dilution tunnel, and dilution ratios were determined using raw and dilute nitric oxide (NO) measurements. Dilute diesel exhaust aerosol was characterized upstream and downstream of a DPF. Filter samples and an AVL photo-acoustic soot sensor were used to estimate PM mass emissions, and TSI aerosol instruments were used to measure aerosol size distributions and total number concentrations. An electrostatic precipitator, DMA, electrometer and CPC were used to evaluate the aerosol charge distribution. Downstream measurements were repeated as the filter was progressively failed in a series of steps. These measurements were then used to evaluate the response of the Honeywell exhaust soot sensor. Under certain steady state conditions the sensor output showed a statistically significant increase as the filter was failed but the output was susceptible to interference from mechanical vibration and was dependent on engine operating conditions, and the exhaust system used. Exhaust aerosol charge measurements showed the concept is viable but further work is required to refine the sensor...|$|R
