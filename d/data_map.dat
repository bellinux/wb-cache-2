40|$|The {{diversity}} of applications developed with different programming languages, application/data architectures, database systems and representation of data/information leads to heterogeneity issues. One {{of the problem}} challenges in the problem of heterogeneity is about heterogeneity data in term of semantic aspect. The semantic aspect is about data that has the same name with different meaning or data that has a different name with the same meaning. The semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> process is the best solution in the current days to solve semantic data problem. There are many semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> technologies {{that have been used}} in recent years. This research aims to compare and analyze existing semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> technology using five criteria’s. After comparative and analytical process, this research provides recommendations of appropriate semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> technology based on several criteria’s. Furthermore, {{at the end of this}} research we apply the recommended semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> technology to be implemented with the real data in the specific application. The result of this research is the semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> file that contains all data structures in the application data source. This semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> file can be used to map, share and integrate with other semantic <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> from other applications and can also be used to integrate with the ontology language...|$|R

We discuss the rich history {{of the problem and}} the variety of technical solutions advanced in the database community over the previous four decades. Based on this discussion, we develop a basic statement of the <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> problem and a general framework for reasoning about the design space of system solutions to the problem. We then concretely illustrate the framework with the Tupelo system for <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> discovery, focusing on the important common case of relational <b>data</b> sources. Treating <b>mapping</b> discovery as example-driven search in a space of transformations, Tupelo generates queries encompassing the full range of structural and semantic heterogeneities encountered in relational <b>data</b> <b>mapping.</b> Hence, Tupelo is applicable {{in a wide range of}} <b>data</b> <b>mapping</b> scenarios.

Our principal results include explicit representations of these boundary <b>data</b> <b>maps</b> in terms of the resolvent of the underlying Schrödinger operator and the associated boundary trace maps, Krein-type resolvent formulas relating Schrödinger operators corresponding to different (sepa-rated) boundary conditions, and a derivation of the Herglotz property of boundary <b>data</b> <b>maps</b> (up to right multiplication by an appropriate diagonal matrix) in the special self-adjoint case.

5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, since the {{development}} of the top-down methodologies, IA have been used as a basis for {{the development of}} a knowledge audit, which itself in-turn contributes to an organisation’s knowledge management strategy. Once complete, the IA allows examination into where knowledge is produced, where there may be need for further input and where knowledge transfer is required. Furthermore, this analysis develops strategy for knowledge capture, access, storage, dissemination and validation. Dissimilarly to the IA, the objectives of the knowledge audit are to identify any people-related issues which impact the ways in which knowledge is created, transferred and shared and to identify where knowledge could be captured, where it is required and then determine how best to undertake a knowledge transfer as [...] "unlike information, knowledge is bound to a person, organisation or community." [...] Similarities between the knowledge and information audit methodologies can be noted however, as questionnaires, the development of an inventory, analysis of flow and a <b>data</b> <b>map</b> [...] are here again used. The importance of this audit therefore is to understand the strategic significance of an organisation’s knowledge assets to ensure management is focused to those areas it is specifically required.|$|E
