500|$|According to Stefan Marschal, the post-World War II years, {{particularly}} the 1980s and 1990s, saw tremendous growth in parliamentary assemblies, {{with more than}} 40 established since 1949. About 42% of the world's parliamentary assemblies are formally affiliated with an intergovernmental organization; 32% are informally affiliated; and 26% are unaffiliated. The spread in parliamentary assemblies was spurred by acceptance of parliamentarism {{as a means of}} legitimizing decisions; initiatives for <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>cooperation</b> reaching a point at which stronger parliamentary backing was needed; and regional integration. However, many global organizations, such as the UN and WTO, still lack a parliamentary assembly and [...] "have been heavily criticized for what is supposed to be an institutional deficit." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bruce–Page plan of May 1923 put {{in motion}} efforts to {{coordinate}} state-federal operations in several areas, particularly infrastructure and rural development schemes. The Main Roads Development Act of 1923 {{was one of}} the first and most important legislative accomplishments in this vein. The act leveraged Section 96 of the Constitution to grant financial assistance to the states by employing it to fund road construction and maintenance according to the plans of the federal transportation portfolio in effect allowing the Commonwealth to operate directly in what was constitutionality the exclusive domain of the state governments. The Act would provide a precedent for many types of [...] "special purpose payments" [...] that became a common feature of Australian federal fiscal relations. Despite some major successes, Bruce was more frequently frustrated by a lack of progress in many key areas of <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The states could not be induced to standardise electrical power schemes, nor unify on track gauges, nor national health insurance despite years of work and solid arguments in favour.|$|E

2500|$|Lack of reciprocity. There is no US {{legislation}} to allow reciprocity, {{and as of}} 2017, no reciprocal data exchanges have taken place. The model IGA states: [...] "The Parties are committed to working with Partner Jurisdictions and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on adapting the terms of this Agreement and other agreements between the United States and Partner Jurisdictions to a common model for automatic exchange of information, including the development of reporting and due diligence standards for financial institutions." [...] The president's budget for year 2014 included a proposal to allow the Treasury Secretary to collect information {{which could be used}} for FATCA reciprocity. [...] The proposal stated that its intent was to [...] "facilitate such <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>cooperation</b> by enabling the IRS to reciprocate in appropriate circumstances"; however, the proposal did not request to allow the Secretary to have further transmittal authority. The president's federal budget proposals of 2014, 2015 and 2016 did not list either costs or revenues for reciprocity implementation in any of the coming 10 years—thus assuming that this collection was either cost neutral or, more logically, it would be interpreted as not budgeted.|$|E

40|$|Barriers of {{infinite}} (or very large) height prevent certain rearrangements of the atoms in a molecule from occurring {{and thus the}} complete nuclear permutation inversion (CNPI) group of the molecule can be reduced. Using the example of acetaldehyde molecule, {{it was pointed out}} that some barriers {{of infinite}} height, in addition to reducing the CNPI group, constrain torsional dynamics explicitly and influence how the torsional coordinate transforms under the MS group. It was proved that the symmetry properties of the torsional potential do not depend on the geometrical symmetry of either the top or the frame.

In negotiating the 1988 risk-based capital agreement, most Western officials' unstated goal may arguably be described as postponing the pain of adapting their domestic regulatory schemes to successor officials' watch. They hoped they could buy time by raising book-value capital requirements for Japanese banks. Efficient-market theory indicates that the market value rather than the book value of a bank's capital impacts its funding cost. It also clarifies that restrictions on domestic and foreign bank competition for Japanese deposits unfairly enhance Japanese banks' ability to intermediate that country's massive capital exports. ...|$|R
