5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. To engage a particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully engages a gear on the other shaft. If the <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper takes a helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|R

50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|E
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|E
50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging the clutch by pressing the clutch pedal only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging the clutch in neutral (between gears by letting the clutch pedal all the way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and free <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage the clutch again (by pressing the clutch pedal only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the drive coupling and flywheel and engaging the clutch plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on the clutch while driving, because these types of transmissions use the clutch for some very different purposes. The depth the clutch is depressed to the floor will determine what the clutch will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory tests that {{were aimed at}} detecting early stages of various faults in toothed wheels by measurement and analysis of transverse vibration speed of the transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> In experimental investigation, cracking of the root tooth and chipping of the tooth were detected. The laser vibrometer Ometron VH 300 + was used for non-contact measurement of shaft transversal vibration speed. Gear vibrations were recorded in selected points of gear housing and <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> at different speeds and gear loads. Results were analyzed and compared but in this paper is presented only selected examples. This paper shows that {{on the basis of}} the transverse vibration speed of transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts,</b> it is possible to detect defects at an earlier stage than {{on the basis of the}} housing vibration accelerations. In the case of measuring gear shaft vibration velocity, the way of the signal generated by the defect of a gear wheel (or bearing) is shortened as well as the influence of composed transmittance of the bearing-gear housing system is eliminated. WV time-frequency analysis and complex continuous wavelet transformations were used for detection. The authors introduced a measure of local tooth damage, which was proportional to the size of damage. The results of research presented in this paperconfirmed that the defect's measure is very sensitive to the development of teeth faults...|$|E
40|$|A novel type of {{integral}} {{squeeze film}} damper (ISFD) is proposed to reduce and isolate vibration excitations of the gear system through bearing to the foundation. Four ISFD designs were tested experimentally with an open first-grade spur gear system. Vibration reduction characteristics were experimentally studied at different speeds for cases where ISFD elastic damping supports were simultaneously installed on the driving and driven shafts, installed on the driven shaft, or only installed on the driving shaft. Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> with ISFD installed only on driven or driving shafts were compared. Results indicated that vibration reduction is better when ISFD is only installed on the driven shaft than on the driving shaft...|$|E

The calculations include the elastic deflections of the <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> and the deflections of the four shaft bearings. The method assumes that the surface curvature of each tooth is constant near the unloaded pitch point. Results from these calculations will help designers reduce transmission weight without seriously reducing transmission performance...|$|E
