It aimed to develop a multi-modal traveler information system for the San Francisco Bay Area, combining public and private sector talents. The Broad Area Study {{is part of the}} TravInfo FOT evaluation. This paper addresses issues on the willingness to pay for traveler information. Two waves of telephone surveys of Bay Area households were conducted, one prior to and one after the Field Operational Test. The initial survey was conducted in November 1995, eight months prior to the TravInfo FOT began and the final survey was conducted in November 1998, three months after the FOT was ended. The paper presents the findings of the second wave Broad Area survey regarding the willingness to pay for traveler information. The rationale is that information can help travelers make better decisions that ultimately reduce traffic congestion and pollution. However, the personal benefits of certain types of high quality travel information may motivate individuals to pay for information. This study analyzes the preferences of automobile and transit travelers' willingness to pay for a high quality advanced traveler information service. The most desirable information content options were constant updates, alternate route <b>information,</b> <b>in-car</b> computer <b>information,</b> expected delay and comparing route times. The results also indicate that a significant population of "information seeking" travelers is willing to pay for specific information content.

Yet implementing multi-hop vehicular communications is highly challenging {{due to the}} highly time-varying nature of vehicles. In addition to node mobility and the impediments of wireless communication, a network comprised of moving vehicles is a dynamic system that can be fragmented into many individual components of disparate connectivity. In this paper we describe and analyze a routing scheme that exploits this dynamic connectivity {{for the purpose of}} message propagation of attributed (or labelled) data in a fragmented VANET. Our analysis provides upper and lower bounds on message propagation rate {{as a function of the}} traffic density, vehicle speed, and radio range; and sheds light into the role played by each of these network parameters. An important insight from our analysis is that vehicle mobility in the opposite traffic direction can be used to achieve substantial gains in message propagation rates. Our analytical findings are supported by extensive simulations. The simulation results indicate that under certain traffic conditions an increase in vehicle mobility results in an order-of-magnitude increase in message propagation rate. I...|$|E

A common practice {{is to use}} discrete textual information (e. g. 500 meters) in combination with a graphical bar representing relative spatial information. Hitherto there exists no design consistency with respect to bars for distance illustration. Contemporary solutions differ in terms of movement direction (upward vs. downward), composition type (decreasing vs. increasing), or alignment (horizontal vs. vertical). We conducted a driving simulator experiment to investigate user preferences, perceived location, and eye gaze data for a meaningful subset of bars in a dynamic scenario. When approaching a traffic event (road works), {{one out of four}} vertical bar alternatives indicated the current distance. Subsequently, the associated horizontal bar type (decreasing or increasing) visualized the driver’s spatial progress within the road works section.

Accordingly, we elaborated an initial version of design guidelines for bars representing relative spatial information for local events.

40|$|Supporting {{the driver}} in {{conducting}} his nowadays demanding task is a promising means {{to get the}} maximum out of the road system with respect to both efficiency and safety. With respect to safety, speed management is a main issue. Police enforcement of speeding is one approach, preventing high speeds another. Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) Systems may enable this by operating at an externally induced reference speed limit. ICC is an in-vehicle system that automatically regulates a vehicle's speed and is capable of maintaining a proper following distance behind a lead vehicle. ICCs so far can realise a moderate level of deceleration: in situations that require higher the driver must take over control. Some kind of short-range communication with the road side offers the option to obtain <b>in-car</b> preview <b>information</b> about relevant conditions on the road ahead, including prevailing speed limits). Some driving simulator studies were conducted to assess the effects of ICC on driving behaviour for both informative and intervening ICC systems. The results reveal that ICC yields more consistent longitudinal control: in car-following situations, there is less variation in headway and in speed. Only intervening systems result in a speed reduction on motorway sections with a special speed limit, but {{at a cost of}} somewhat higher speeds at non-controlled sections. In critical scenarios (approaching a sudden traffic queue) where ICC could not cope with completely and the driver had to take over control, a somewhat later braking reaction of the driver was found. Also within the European project MASTER (MAnaging Speeds of Traffic on European Roads) the testing of the testing of (dynamic) speed limiters in a simulator study resulted in a reduced speed, speed variance and speed at hazardous locations. However, the speed limiters also had secondary effects that could compromise safety, viz. a higher incidence of short headways, delayed braking and a higher incidence of collisions. A field-trial with an in-vehicle dynamic speed limiter in three countries (Sweden, The Netherlands, and Spain) revealed that the speed limiter significantly reduced speed on 30 - 70 km/h roads, but not on 80 - 90 km/h roads and motorways (mainly due to heavy traffic conditions). In conclusion, automatic speed limiting by an in-car device seems most promising within built-up areas. Some concern about behavioural adaptation mechanisms may apply...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Road {{authorities}} {{around the}} globe struggle with the question whether variable message signs (VMSs) should solely be used for traffic management or {{can also be used}} to display traffic-irrelevant messages, such as commercial advertisements. The main questions in this matter concern 1) traffic safety (“will commercial advertisements on VMSs distract the driver?”) and 2) traffic flow management (“will the VMS still make drivers aware of traffic management information in the long-term, once it also displays traffic-irrelevant advertisements?”). Method These questions have been addressed in a literature review followed by a repeated measures experiment in a driving simulator. For this, thirty-two participants drove the same VMS-equipped motorway eight times before encountering a critical route instruction on its VMS (see Figure 1, right). During these eight drives, one group of participants became familiarised to the VMS always being blank while for the other group it always displayed an advertisement. Figure 1. Example of an overhead VMS on a Dutch motorway (left) and in the driving simulator (right), informing drivers to deviate from their route as the road ahead is closed. Results Results showed that 1) the principles which determine whether or not information may distract, do not appear to distinguish between traffic information, road safety messages or commercial advertisements. There are yet no reasons to assume that presenting commercial advertisements on VMSs will have more negative effects than displaying road safety slogans or traffic-related information on VMSs. 2) Although it appeared some participants were ‘blind’ for the route instruction, there was no evidence this was triggered by traffic-irrelevant information; compliance with the route instruction was similar in both groups. However, participants in the advertisements group did appear to be less surprised by the route instruction, resulting in less severe braking. Discussion In conclusion, this study provides no evidence that VMSs cannot safely be used to display non-traffic related messages, such as commercial advertisements, provided they meet general ergonomic principles for VMS messages (Dicke & Brookhuis, 2008) and exclude specific characteristics known to distract drivers (Kroon, Martens, Brookhuis, & Hagenzieker, 2014; SWOV, 2012). Continuously displaying messages did not make drivers more ‘blind’ for changes in electronic messages. Contrary to expectations based on change blindness theory, both the current study as well as other studies on electronic signs (Harms & Brookhuis, 2014; Jamson & Merat, 2007), showed there was no evidence for reduced perception of signs when these were preceded by other active signs.

Nevertheless, this difference tended to diminish with the practice and the elderly attitude towards the system was positive. The last years had seen something of a shift in the interest of the automotive industry: an increasing effort is devoted to the production of innovative systems allowing drivers to communicate with the external world.

Figure 1, adapted from [10], depicts the logic diagram for an advanced traffic management system (ATMS), a paradigmatic case of ITS. This generic ATMS assumes that the network is equipped with an appropriate layout of detectors that provide real-time measurements of traf-fic variables, flows, speeds, and occupancy levels; these measurements constitute the main input to traffic models that are solved to estimate {{the current state of}} the network and forecast its short-term evolution. System performance is estimated in terms of “measures of efficiency ” (MOE) : travel times, delays, mean queue lengths, and possibly others, depending on the manager’s objectives; the latter can include estimates of fuel consumption and emission levels when the sustainability of the transportation system is to be taken into account. The estimated system perform-ance and its predicted short-term evolution are then compared with the management performance objectives (e. g., minimize congestion, travel time, or delays, or hold emissions under critical threshold values); in the case of significant deviations, appropriate management strategies are activated (linear speed control, ramp metering, rerouting policies, changes in signal timings, and so on) and put into operation by appropriate ITS devices (variable message signal (VMS) panels, adaptive controllers, <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> systems, and so on).

The report describes {{the findings of}} a literature review on various ATT (Advanced Transport Telematics) and traditional (non-ATT) methods for speed management. Besides traditional speed management measures the following ATT systems were discussed: a) variable speed limit signs, b) feedback signs, c) automatic speed cameras, d) <b>in-car</b> <b>information,</b> e) in-car feedback, f) in-car speed supervisor, g) in-car speed limiters. The outcomes of the literature review were used to select and test the effectiveness of the most promising systems on a driving simulator In the experiment drivers encountered curves (radius 100 or 200 metres) that were treated with one of four implementations: a) transverse bars, b) advisory speed signs, c) in-car visual advice and d) in-car automated speed control. The results revealed that automatic speed control surpassed all the other systems in terms of effectively reducing speed on approach to curves. In terms of user acceptability however, this system was least liked. In a second simulator experiment the effects of different speed management systems (an advisory system and a fixed and dynamic speed limiter) were investigated. Speed control was successful in reducing excessive speed. Speed control also produced better adapted speeds on curve negotiation and in areas with vulnerable road users. Speed variance was also reduced under speed control. The advisory system also appears to have some success in reducing speed. The advisory system worked almost as well as the dynamic speed limiter in potentially hazardous situations. However, there were also some negative effects of the speed control systems in terms of shorter headways in car following and relatively late braking. No effects on reported driver workload were found. The informative system had higher acceptance, even if decreased after experiencing it. The impacts of a variable speed limiter were studied in field trials in real traffic conditions in three “regional typical” European countries using an instrumented car where all measuring equipment was hidden. The results revealed that the speed limiter reduced speeds significantly in free driving conditions, decreased speed variance and approach speeds at curves and intersections. It also increased travel time. The drivers' acceptance of the device increased after the test drive but they still generally felt that speed limiter caused frustration, stress and impatience.

40|$|Congestion on road {{networks}} causes severe problems {{in and around}} large cities. Consequences of congestion include an increase in travel time and travel costs, environmental costs, economic costs, increased energy use and decreased economic growth, reduced travel time reliability, and reduced quality of life. Therefore, mitigation of congestion is deemed necessary. Within the Dutch program “Verkeer en Vervoer” (Traffic and Transport) funded by Connekt/NWO, strategies to mitigate congestion are examined based {{on a combination of}} behavioural change, efficient use of existing infrastructure, and efficient land use. In this thesis {{the focus is on the}} provision of travel information that leads to a more efficient use of the existing infrastructure. Information should be provided to the traveller about which route and which travel mode is optimal for a particular travel network and subsequently for the traveller in that specific situation. More specifically, this thesis focuses on research into a behavioural change as a result of travel information. This change may include a change in route or a change in travel mode. In 2002 during the start of the project that resulted in this thesis in-car travel information was not widely available. At that time the state of the art in travel information was a roadside Dynamic Route Information Panel (DRIP) that showed travel times for travelling by car. Some DRIPs also showed travel times for public transport. Around that time experiments were conducted on the use of Graphical Route Information Panels (GRIP). These panels provided dynamic traffic information graphically and offered the opportunity to display a static simplified map of the road network, including the position of traffic congestion that was shown on a part of the travel network. Short after the next-generation of GRIPs, the Full Colour Information Panel (FCIP) was introduced. On an FCIP the presentation of the map of the road network can be adapted at any time. It allows a display of any kind of text, graphical representation and combinations thereof. These features offer the opportunity to display route maps, text combined with symbols, the position of traffic congestion (colour coded according to severity), or any other representation the designer may wish. In this way, complex information can be provided in a way that makes it easier to process, understand, and remember. While an FCIP has more graphical possibilities than other road-side information devices, there is a risk that more information may be provided than drivers can actually process. The designers of travel information must tread a fine line between providing as much useful information as possible while minimising the risk of information overload. Information overload may result in safety issues and impairment of information processing, particularly, in situations that impose considerable demands on driver's attention, such as high-density traffic. Therefore, it was examined how to effectively design complex dynamic travel information so that it can be optimally used by travellers. Particularly, the effects of designs that combine a route map with colours to indicate the position and severity of congestion are explored. The focus is on the design of the information itself, and also on how travellers interpret and deal with the information that is provided. Method In this thesis, a working model was developed that helps explain why most information panel designs that are currently in use are generally not very effective at encouraging drivers to change their travel plans, while simultaneously indicating what is needed to improve the effect of travel information on behavioural change. The working model is built around the information processing theory of McGuire (1968). This theory indicates that changing attitude and behaviour through information provision is only possible if all of six information processing steps are completed successfully. These steps include: presentation of the information, attention to the information, comprehension of the arguments and of the position the information advocates, yielding to the message contents and its conclusions, retention of the changed attitude, and behaviour based on the changed attitude. This model was extended under the assumption that ergonomic design and social psychological factors in the decision making process are related to information processing. Cognitive and ergonomic guidelines were reviewed that facilitate travellers to read and comprehend the information provided. From a social psychology point of view reasons were reviewed why - in spite of the provision of well-designed information - travellers may or may not take a given advice on board, and why travellers sometimes choose a suboptimal travel option. An improvement of the information by using better ergonomic designs and by taking into account the role of social psychological principles may increase the probability that each step in McGuire’s model is completed successfully. As a result, the effectiveness of traveller information on route and mode choice may be enhanced. Therefore, a basic design of travel information was developed that took into account the effect of uncertainty in route choice. A basic design of a road map was used where both routes end at the same position on the sign. Consequently, the road map had a “closed form” showing that two routes lead to the same location. Within this design experiments were conducted on:  how a route map should be displayed  how colours should be used to indicate location and severity of congestion  how travel times are interpreted  what amount of information can safely and effectively be provided. The chosen research method involved an initial stage in which preliminary versions of traffic information designs were tested in a laboratory setting. In subsequent experiments, continually improved designs were tested in settings that more closely approached reality. When an FCIP that was able to provide reliable travel time information became available, a final experiment was conducted in a real-life setting. The aim of this experiment was to determine the extent to which results from the laboratory studies could be applied to the design of the FCIP, thereby validating its usability. Results Displaying a road map In Chapter 3 we reported research that examined the possibilities of displaying a route map. Designs were used that could be presented on several types of devices. The focus was on the use of information on a Full Colour Information Panel (FCIP). Preferences of travellers concerning the shape of the route map were examined by means of questionnaires. Route maps shaped as is in reality were compared with more abstract representations of the route. Furthermore, the effect of additional information on route choice was examined, such as the type of road or travel time. Notwithstanding the fact that there was no consensus among participants concerning preferences for the shape of a route map it was showed that travel information appearance has an effect on route choice. Even more, evidence was found that these effects were different concerning the presentation of the road map and the kind of additional information. Furthermore, it was shown that simple designs were preferred over designs that were more sophisticated and showed more (ir) relevant information. It may be concluded that it is important to exclude information that is not directly relevant for a route or mode choice but might have an effect on route choice. The use of colour to indicate location and severity of congestion Although the use of colour to indicate congestion has benefits concerning route choice there is a concern that the use of colour could increase the amount of information and, as a result, this could increase information processing time for the road user. The use of colour is seen as redundant information as travel time itself also indicates to some extent the severity of congestion. In Chapter 4, we reported two studies in which we examined the effect of the use of colour to indicate congestion on information processing times and preferences for a method to display congestion. In a lab experiment, the effect of adding colours to a road map to indicate congestion was measured. Participants were shown graphical route information and had to indicate as quickly as possible which of the routes had the shortest travel time. We found that additional traffic signs that did not indicate travel time (for example a motorway sign) led to a significantly higher information processing time. Furthermore, additional colours to indicate congestion did not lead to significantly longer reaction times. Therefore, it seems likely that additional colours have no negative effect on information processing time. We found that experts in Human Technology Interaction advise against the use of colour, whereas regular road users indicate that the use of colour was an improvement regarding information provision on congestion. We advice to use colours to indicate location and severity of congestion. The use of colour helps indicate the location and severity of congestion without the risk of extra information processing time and it also does not increase the risk of information overload. For colour blind travellers, travel times or other indicators of congestion will still be available. Our experiments show that there is no reason not to include information concerning congestion on route information, as there are no disadvantages of displaying information about congestion it easily justifies the advantage of extra traffic information. Interpretation of travel times To make clear to travellers what the presented travel time for public transport means is still an unresolved issue. Most travellers indicate that the travel time on an information panel indicates the travel time for the public transport option from station to station. However, in most situations the travel time for public transport is shown to enable a comparison with the travel time by car. Therefore, the travel time for public transport indicates the travel time from the current position to the destination station shown on the information panel. In Chapter 5 research is reported that indicates that 36 % of the participants interpreted the meaning of travel time incorrectly in our study. Although this percentage is too high, it is positive compared to other studies where more than 60 % interprets the travel time incorrectly. The working model introduced in Chapter 2 can provide an explanation for this finding. That is, travellers who are uncertain of the meaning of the travel time are unlikely to change their behaviour. The information should clearly indicate for which trajectory the information is applicable, whether the travel time is actual or dynamic or static. More research is needed on this issue. It is one of the most important improvements that are needed to increase the effect of multi modal travel information on travel mode choice. As long as travellers are uncertain about the meaning of the displayed travel time for public transport options, they are unlikely to choose public transport. Moreover, travellers that are certain about the meaning of the travel time but mistakenly think that it indicates the travel time from station to station will add travel time for travelling to the station. The comparison between travelling by car and travelling by public transport will in that case almost always be in favour of travelling by car. Amount of information A paradox in the presentation of travel information is that complete information will lead to a higher probability of changing travel plans. However, being complete in information provision includes adding information that may result in information overload. As a result, information is missed (because a driver has limited time to consult information) or information is ignored. The result is a lower probability of drivers changing travel plans. In Chapter 5 the effect of the amount of information provided on information processing was examined. In a traffic simulator we showed information on panels that helped to make a route choice or mode choice. We added information that we thought that travellers need to reduce uncertainty about the meaning of travel information and that would increase the attitude towards Park and Ride use. The results of this experiment suggest that the design that contained the most information elements was almost ignored completely. Probably the respondents decided that it would be impossible to read all information in the short time they had available and therefore they completely ignored the information. Our results and results of other studies imply that the amount of information that will be processed effectively is limited. Therefore, it is crucial to decide what information will be provided at what location, by means of which type of information device and at what moment. Route choice: travellers do not change plans during their trip In Chapter 6 a field experiment was reported that was held at a public event in Scheveningen (a fireworks show). This study showed that road users hardly change their travel mode during their trip. Visitors of the festival that parked on the Park and Ride facility were asked about their intention in the pre-trip stage. They either made this decision at home or didn’t make a decision at all concerning the trip towards Scheveningen. Travellers that had a travel plan hardly changed their route. This result means that:  Travellers hardly change their travel plan during the on-trip stage. Only travelers without a travel plan may change to the Park and Ride location.  Decisions concerning the use of Park and Ride are made during the pre-trip phase  The road-side information concerning the Park and Ride facility is not used to decide to use the Park and Ride. This decision is made pre-trip based on other information (for example a website with information concerning visiting the event). Studies in Chapter 5 indicate that <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> is more effective at encouraging change of travel mode to a park and Ride facility compared to road side information. The possibility to consult the information more than once, or more importantly, to read the information within a larger time-frame, may result in a deeper elaboration of the information. Consequently, travellers may choose Park and Ride more often. Furthermore, travellers relying on their <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> system generally do not make travel plans. They follow the instructions of their in-car system. Effects of travel information on traffic safety In chapter 5, we presented the results of studies on the effect of different types of in-car travel information on route choice and traffic safety. In the first driving simulator study, three systems for <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> were compared with respect to route and mode choice and traffic safety. A design with auditory information, a PDA with pictograms and a mobile phone with text messages were compared against each other. It was found that text messages on a mobile phone had a stronger negative influence on traffic safety. The disadvantage of text messaging is that the information does not fit on the screen and that the use of pictograms is not possible. As a result, the driver has to switch screens while driving. Smartphones currently in use in theory offer many functions that may help provide safe and well designed travel information. In a second driver simulator study reported in Chapter 5 <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> on a PDA was compared to road side information, both containing the same information elements. No negative effects on traffic safety were found for those who used the PDA compared to <b>in-car</b> <b>information.</b> Mental effort to consult the information was equal for in-car and road-side information. Furthermore, travellers consulting <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> decreased their speed more than travellers that consulted road-side information. Fixations to information should not last more than two seconds per fixation with a maximum of four fixations. At least the maximum total amount of fixations was violated for all conditions, indicating that the total amount of information on the designs is still too much to be able to process during traffic conditions. More research is needed to decrease the amount of information. Guidelines Based on the results of the research reported in this thesis, the following guidelines are proposed for the provision of information on road side panels, in-car systems and personal devices.  Travellers are not easily persuaded to change their travel mode during their trip. It would therefore be advisable to focus on changing perceptions of alternatives to driving by car during the on-trip stage and to provide information on how the system works in the pre-trip stage.  A change in travel behaviour should be encouraged in the pre-trip phase. Therefore, information that contains arguments in favour of travel behaviour change should be provided. If a change to public transport is possible on a route and multimodal travel information is available then the traveller should be informed during the pre-trip phase that on a certain location additional travel information is provided. The traveller is then able to plan a trip and explore the public transport option. In case the travel times for public transport are shorter than those of the car (e. g. in case of an accident) the traveller might more easily decide to change travel mode because in the pre-trip phase uncertainty about how to travel by public transport is reduced.  In order to optimise the probability that travellers change their travel mode or route plans, information should be available on the internet that guides the traveller during the trip. For example, information that is available for smart phones. Uncertainty during the whole trip should be decreased.  Road side travel information should inform road users about current or expected traffic situations in the travel network. The information should be designed so that elaboration on the information is hardly necessary. For example, by providing an advice instead of only information. The information should prompt the driver to change behaviour while making sure they are more or less in line with decisions that were made earlier in the pre-trip phase.  Try to use the least amount of information possible. Dynamic information should be provided on a DRIP or GRIP. However, static information like parking fees, or that a parking place is secured etc., should be provided on static signs following the dynamic information.  The presentation of a road structure may have the side-effect that travellers interpret a road that is displayed as longer also has a longer travel time.  Do not include information that in itself would not have an effect on the route or mode choice. The road structure should not be presented as it is in reality as it then probably contains a lot of information that is not important (for example the location of bends).  <b>In-car</b> <b>information</b> is more effective in encouraging changes in route or mode choice, but possibly less safe compared to road side information. Therefore, in-car travel information should be  tailored information (only providing information that is relevant for the driver and the trip made); leave out information that is known by the driver.  designed such that information fits on one screen  designed such that with the least amount of elements the most important information is provided  only provided at times when the driver can pay attention to the information  Use colour coding to indicate stagnant traffic and slow moving traffic.  Make the provision of travel information uniform for all information panels. The traveller should know what a travel time indicated means.  During special events, travellers who are unfamiliar with the environment will change their route more easily. In such situations, travel information may be very effective particularly for this group of travellers. Information for travelling to an event (such as a festival) should be included on the website of this event.  Before providing road side travel information, it is important to get answers into the following questions:  for how many travellers is the information relevant?  what is the origin and destination of the travellers on a specific road?  what possibilities do travellers have to travel differently?  during which situations does the information offer a real alternative to the travellers?  what is necessary besides presenting the information panel to make the information effective...|$|E
40|$|In the 'ITS Plan the Netherlands 2013 - 2017 ' and the Dutch {{programme}} Connecting Mobility, {{there is}} the ambition to raise the valuation of human factors of ITS applications. This will make the technical applications more effective and safe. The first step is this guideline for the save design of <b>in-car</b> <b>information</b> services. The trend is that traffic related information services will be presented more by individual means in vehicles ('in-car') and less by collective means on the road side (next or above roads). Due to this trend, more and also different types of parties will provide traffic information services to the road user via in-car systems and mobile devices. It is {{the aim of the}} Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment and the Dutch programme Connecting Mobility to support that in-car traffic service providers take the abilities and capabilities of the driver into account when developing these services. The effect of the services will largely be depending on how road users respond to the information, and therefore also on how these systems are designed and how they interact with the driver. This guideline is made in commission of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment by TNO, SWOV and RUG, in cooperation with DITCM. It gives practical support to: 1) Designers, to develop safe in-car traffic information services 2) Authorities who commission the development of traffic information services, in specifying the tender and checking project proposals. This guideline don't have the status of formal regulation and are voluntary in use. It is meant as base for parties that want to deliver good services in respect to the shared collective aim of road safety. It can become a living document that will be up-dated after some time based on experience with new technologies (e. g. Google Glass) and new research. The guideline as described in this report is based on existing literature, European standards (such as ESOP and SAE), expert opinions and consultations with relevant public and private organisations, both {{at the beginning of this}} project as at the stage of the concept guideline. The underlying principle of the guideline is the objective that the information service does not give rise to potentially hazardous driving behaviour. All criteria pursue this objective, which means that the criteria are interdependent. That is, a bad performance on one criterion may be detrimental to the performance on other criteria and the overall service. With that, it is not only important to design for safe use of the driver using the service, but also to take the behaviour of other (non-equipped) road users into account. An advice or warning may seem in the best interest to the driver, but it may undermine traffic safety due to the (absent) reactions of other road users. It is important to realise that a traffic information service will operate in the complex and dynamic traffic environment. The guideline is developed for services that support the driver in his or her driving task, and distinguishes safety related warnings and non-safety related information (such as navigation advice and driver behaviour feedback apps). The guideline is not written for apps that provide entertainment or commercials, since it is the believe that, in general and at the moment, such systems are not reconcilable with a safe performance of the driving task. Though, knowing that advertisement cannot be outlawed, it is important to understand the basic principles of this guideline to minimize the safety risks that distraction by such messages may cause. For instance, these messages should only be given when driver's workload is low and should have the lowest priority (in comparison to information related to the driving task). Furthermore, this guideline elaborates on standard devices, currently available. New developments, such as head-up displays or head -mounted displays, will bring new design possibilities, which are not all covered by the current criteria. The guideline is divided in two sections. The first section is on human factor criteria, describing aspects of the interaction with the driver such that the service is not seriously distracting nor raising driver's workload to an unacceptable level. This guideline elaborates the criteria and provides some examples per criterion to illustrate their application in practice. Topics that will be covered are related to driver workload, timing of a message, information priority, distraction, validity, recognisability, acceptance, physical interaction and possible side effects. The second section is on ergonomic criteria, focussing on issues such as legibility and audibility of the information. These criteria are more or less self-explaining and do not require additional information. Therefore examples will not be provided in the second section. (Author/publisher...|$|E
