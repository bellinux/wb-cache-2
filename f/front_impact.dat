500|$|The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) {{tested a}} C3 Picasso Confort [...] model with {{standard}} equipment, including: a single forward airbag for each front seat, a speed limitation device, but no ESC. The vehicle was scored {{on the basis}} of: child and adult injury, including whiplash risk from the seating, a pedestrian <b>front</b> <b>impact</b> rating, safety equipment and clear labels detailing how to disable some features. The results of the front end tests were mixed, with the bumper scoring all available points, but the vehicle was penalised {{for the lack of}} protection and the potential damage caused if a pedestrian is struck by the bonnet. Protection inside the car was scored highly for almost every seat, and for adult and child protection; it lost points for its use of forward-facing restraints, which can be fatal in an accident if an infant is hit by an airbag. The C3 Picasso was also penalised for offering very poor whiplash protection in the driver's seatscoring nothing in two of the three tests and then losing points for the position of the unadjusted restraint. Overall, the vehicle scored four of five stars, less than most vehicles the Euro NCAP compares it with, which were released around the same time.|$|E

50|$|Typically, crumple {{zones are}} located in the front part of the vehicle, in order to absorb the impact of a head-on collision, though they may be found on other parts of the vehicle as well. According to a British Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre study of where on the vehicle impact damage occurs: 65% were <b>front</b> <b>impacts,</b> 25% rear impacts, 5% left side, and 5% right side. Some racing cars use aluminium, composite/carbon fibre honeycomb, or energy {{absorbing}} foam to form an impact attenuator that dissipates crash energy using a much smaller volume and lower weight than road car crumple zones. Impact attenuators have also been introduced on highway maintenance vehicles in some countries.|$|R

50|$|U.S. Special Forces {{had sought}} to create a round that had {{increased}} power out of carbine M4 barrels and compact SCAR-L barrels, while increasing hard target performance. Developmental efforts {{led to the creation}} of the Mk318. The bullet uses an open-tip design to inflict damage on soft tissue, and has a brass rear to penetrate hard targets. The tip and lead core fragments consistently even when using short barrels, while the rear moves through once the <b>front</b> <b>impacts.</b> It has more consistent performance because it is not yaw-dependent like the M855; the nose fragments upon impact and solid rear penetrator continues to move relatively straight. This makes the Mk318 effective against personnel with or without body armor. The round also increases accuracy, from 3-5 minute of angle (MOA) with the M855 from an M4A1 barrel to 1.71 MOA at 300 yards and 1.67 MOA at 600 yards from a 14 in SCAR-L barrel.|$|R

30|$|Recently, data {{based on}} direct {{measurements}} of head impact exposure {{in college football}} players demonstrated that running backs and quarterbacks suffer the hardest and most severe blows to the head, while linemen and linebackers suffer more head impacts during a game than players in other positions (Crisco et al. 2011). Nearly 300, 000 head impacts at three institutions were recorded over three seasons. The researchers measured impacts with standard football helmets outfitted with sensors that recorded such data as head acceleration and impact location which allowed them to quantify the severity and frequency of blows to the head by player position. Offensive line and quarterbacks had the highest and lowest frequency, respectively, of <b>front</b> <b>impacts.</b> In contrast, quarterbacks received the greatest magnitude and the most frequent impacts {{to the back of}} the helmet. Data also suggest that top-of-head impacts have a higher risk of concussion than <b>impacts</b> to the <b>front,</b> right, or back of the head (Guskiewicz et al. 2007). Top-of-helmet impacts might result in causing the cerebellum to impact the base of the skull and recoil superiorly into the cerebellar tentorium.|$|R
40|$|Impacts on exposed {{spacecraft}} surfaces generate vapour, {{liquid and}} solid ejecta particles. Unless this encounters {{other parts of}} the spacecraft it escapes into space.

On the front surfaces these craters liberated solid spall-type glass fragments with dimensions up to similar to 40 % of the maximum spallation diameter. Pictorial evidence from the HST solar array impacts is presented, indicating that the largest fragments produced are in the millimetre size range and are due to impacts from the rear. Using the HST data an estimate of the fragment size distribution, production rate and total mass loss is presented. On the thin HST arrays rear impacts dominate the mass loss being an order of magnitude above that due to <b>front</b> <b>impacts.</b> Consideration of the ballistic coefficients of these sized particles under atmospheric drag indicates that they could remain for up to a year in orbit after release...|$|R
