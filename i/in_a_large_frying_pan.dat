50|$|As a stew, it {{is unique}} in that all the main {{ingredients}} are cut into slices, so as to lie flat. Because of this, it is normally cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan,</b> {{on top of the}} stove, and served on a plate (as opposed to a bowl). The vegetables used are typically potatoes, onions, carrots (sliced lengthwise) and peas. Although usually made with smoked bacon, minced beef is occasionally substituted.|$|E
50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan.</b> Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|E
50|$|To make garri, cassava tubers are peeled, {{washed and}} grated or crushed {{to produce a}} mash. The mash could be mixed with palm oil (oil garri) before being placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> porous bag. It is then placed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{adjustable}} press machine for 1-3 hours to remove excess starchy water. When the cassava has become dry enough, it {{is ready for the}} next step. It is then sieved and <b>fried</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> clay <b>frying</b> pot with or without palm oil. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two primary}} ways {{to prepare the}} fish (most popularly, sole or trout). One is by sautéing—first {{dredging}} the fish in seasoned flour (white flour or corn flour) and then cooking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hot sauté pan {{with a small amount}} of clarified butter. The alternative method is to pan-fry or deep fry the floured fish. In pan frying, oil or a combination of oil and butter is used—up to perhaps 2 cm deep. Deep frying is done <b>in</b> either <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>fry</b> pot or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone deep fryer. The floured fish is completely submerged in the hot oil. The frying techniques result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crisper texture, but the sauce will need to be made separately. The sautéed fish will have a softer skin by comparison, but allows for the possibility of creating the sauce [...] after the fish has been removed by adding fresh butter, parsley, and lemon.|$|R
50|$|Fit-fit, or fir-fir, is {{a common}} breakfast dish. It is made from {{shredded}} injera or kitcha stir-fried with spices or wat. Another popular breakfast food is fatira. The delicacy consists of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>fried</b> pancake made with flour, often {{with a layer of}} egg, eaten with honey. Chechebsa (or kita firfir) resembles a pancake covered with berbere and niter kibbeh, or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. A porridge, genfo is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> bowl with <b>a</b> dug-out made <b>in</b> the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced niter kibbeh.|$|R

50|$|Two eggs, {{one-half}} cup of milk, one-half cup of flour, a {{pinch of}} salt, a little nutmeg and one teaspoonful of sugar. Mix well. Have <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> pan ready with hot butter. Be sure and have the butter run all over {{the inside of the}} pan so the pancake will not stick to the sides when it rises.

5000|$|The pan {{was built}} in 2004 by men of the local {{community}} of Brandon. It took these men a little over forty volunteer man hours to construct the frying pan.

The pan was originally built as a promotional tool for the Brandon Area Community Club’s semi-annual fundraiser, the [...] "cowboy breakfast". They chose to build <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> pan because the cowboy breakfast is cooked over open flames using mostly cast iron frying pans.|$|R

He is jealous of Harlequin, to whom Cassander wants to give his daughter. Without Harlequin's seeing him do it, he annoys him with his fishing line. Thinking Cassander is to blame, Harlequin punches the old man, knocking him to the ground. Columbine, indignant, slaps Harlequin's face. Pierrot, after having helped Cassander up, tries to goad Harlequin into a fight. The latter refuses. [...] "I don't fight with a valet", he says. And to calm Cassander, he gives him an enormous watch. Cassander softens, and shushes Pierrot, who wants to swoop down on his rival. In {{the midst of this}} brawl, Cassander receives the blows of the two combatants. Columbine, to calm Pierrot, whom she loves, gives him her flower without being seen by Harlequin.|$|R
