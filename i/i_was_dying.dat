5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E
2500|$|While {{starring}} in Show Boat, Clayton met Robert Lerner, an {{heir to the}} women's clothing shops bearing his name. They were married and moved to California, where Lerner attended Loyola Law School and Clayton concentrated on mothering.

I stuck the stump of my arm into the snow, but the warm blood melted the snow.

2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll." [...] Lyrically, she recalls a feverish trek for sexual gratification. She sings in the first verse, [...] "Maybe I should have called you first, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> to get to you/I was dreaming while I drove the long, straight road ahead." [...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke you from your sleep {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E
2500|$|... "I Will Try" [...] {{is about}} having a {{positive}} outlook on life. James has explained that he has 'a very negative outlook on the world' and that he can 'never really appreciate anything' so the song is a reminder to himself to try and {{look on the bright}} side. He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and my dear friend David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and appreciate all the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when I was at my lowest point, I genuinely believed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'. [...] "Fifty Four" [...] is about James' girlfriend. 'She is my only real sense of normality and I owe her more than I can write down in words for that'.|$|E

Nay, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> fast, and oh, the horror of it! I strove to pray and could not; there was no more time for prayer. One struggle and the stillness crept into my brain.
