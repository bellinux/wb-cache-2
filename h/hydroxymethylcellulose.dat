30|$|Intervention: Hysterosalpingo-Foam Sonography (HyFoSy): Hysterosalpingo-Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) with foam {{infusion}} {{was performed}} with a <b>hydroxymethylcellulose</b> and glycerol containing non toxic foam through a cervical applicator. Transvaginal Ultrasonography was performed and dispersion of foam in the Fallopian tube and or peritoneal cavity to demonstrate tubal patency was observed. In case patency {{could not be}} demonstrated a hysteropsalpingography (HSG) was performed as control.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to evaluate Sterculia foetida gum as a hydrophilic matrix polymer for controlled release preparation. For evaluation as a matrix polymer; characterization of Sterculia foetida gum was done. Viscosity, pH, scanning electronmicrographs were determined. Different formulation aspects considered were: gum concentration (10 – 40 %), particle size (75 – 420  μm) and type of fillers and those for dissolution studies; pH, and stirring speed were considered. Tablets prepared with Sterculia foetida gum were compared with tablets prepared with <b>Hydroxymethylcellulose</b> K 15 M. The release rate profiles were evaluated through different kinetic equations: zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixon-Crowell and Korsemeyer and Peppas models. The scanning electronmicrographs showed that the gum particles were somewhat triangular. The viscosity of 1 % solution {{was found to be}} 950 centipoise and pH was in range of 4 – 5. Suitable matrix release profile could be obtained at 40 % gum concentration. Higher sustained release profiles were obtained for Sterculia foetida gum particles in size range of 76 – 125  μm. Notable influences were obtained for type of fillers. Significant differences were also observed with rotational speed and dissolution media pH. The in vitro release profiles indicated that tablets prepared from Sterculia foetida gum had higher retarding capacity than tablets prepared with <b>Hydroxymethylcellulose</b> K 15 M prepared tablets. The differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that there are no interactions of Sterculia foetida gum with diltiazem hydrochloride. It was observed that release of the drug followed through surface erosion and anomalous diffusion. Thus, it could be concluded that Sterculia foetida gum could be used a controlled release matrix polymer...|$|E
40|$|The bioadhesive {{properties}} of the hydrophobic, basic polyelectrolyte hydrogel disks containing crosslinked N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate 30 / 70 mol% were evaluated in vitro using gastric(pH 1. 2), sublingual (pH 6. 5), vaginal (pH 4. 0) and intestinal (pH 7. 5) pig's mucosas. Adhesive strength was measured using a modified Du Nouy tensiometer by measuring the force of detachment between a gel disk and the respective mucosa. The effect of crosslinker content in the gel was evaluated. It was found {{an increase in the}} adhesive strength with the increase of crosslinker content in the pH range of 4. 0 - 7. 5. For the evaluation at pH 1. 2 (gastric mucosa) the opposite behavior was observed. The results indicate that initial bioadhesive contact {{may be the result of}} surface energy effects and/or electrostatic interactions of oppositely charged groups between mucin and the gel. In some cases, mucus dehydration may also be involved. When the gel is swollen, chain interpenetration also plays a roll in the bioadhesive interaction. The gels presented bioadhesive forces in gastric and vaginal mucosas (acidic medium), similar to the adhesive forces of well-known bioadhesives such as <b>hydroxymethylcellulose</b> and sodium alginate to the intestinal mucosa. The results indicate that hydrophobic polybasic gels present bioadhesive properties that make them suitable for site specific, pH controlled drug delivery, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Solid-phase {{extraction}} (SPE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important techniques for sample enrichment in water analysis. Typical applications include the pre-concentration of trace amounts of pesticides, organic contaminants, and pharmaceuticals in water 1. The use of porous styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer particles as adsorbent in SPE has significantly increased in the last decade. Sometimes specific functional groups were introduced by Friedel Krafts reactions in order to increase retention of polar analytes 1. Other properties like particle size, specific surface area and pore size play also an important role in the performance of the phases 2. In order to increase the efficiency of the adsorbents in the pre-concentration of polar analytes by SPE, copolymers of styrene, divinylbenzene and different amounts of glycidyl methacrylate were synthesised by suspension radical polymerization. A mixture of heptane and toluene (70 / 30 v/v) was used as porogenic agent. The initiator was 2, 2 ’-azobisbutyronitrile (AIBN). The organic phase was dispersed in the aqueous phase, a solution of <b>hydroxymethylcellulose</b> and sodium chloride. The reaction was carried out at 75 oC for 10 hours under nitrogen atmosphere. In all reactions 50 mol- % of divinylbenzene was used. The styrene and glycidyl methacrylate quantities were varied between 0 and 50 mol-%. The microspheres obtained were washed with water, acetone and methanol and dried at 60 °C. The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption using the BET-method. The microspheres were observed by scanning electron microscopy and the images wer...|$|E
