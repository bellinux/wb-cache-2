500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school {{and there was nothing}} in the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
2500|$|McKeag still {{retained}} ambitions {{to return}} to Parliament as a Liberal but during the Second World War there was a truce between the main political parties which ensured {{that they did not}} oppose each other when by-elections occurred. In 1940 however the seat of Newcastle upon Tyne North became vacant on the retirement of Sir Nicholas Grattan-Doyle, the sitting Conservative MP. [...] While the Liberals would not officially oppose the Conservative candidate, Sir Nicholas' son Second Lieutenant Howard Grattan-Doyle, McKeag was talked of as a possible Independent candidate for the by-election. [...] However, the seat was successfully contested by an Independent Unionist, Cuthbert Headlam. In the event, McKeag did not stand, perhaps because like a large number of electors he found it distasteful to fight an election when the British Expeditionary Force was struggling to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the beaches of Dunkirk, perhaps because he did not wish his political career to interfere with his own war service.|$|E
6000|$|... "When did you <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Maitland?" [...] asked Mrs. March. [...] "Did {{you have}} a {{pleasant}} time? And how did you leave Emily and the children?" ...|$|E
60|$|You {{ask me why}} I {{call that}} old {{great-grandmother}} black cat Chops? Well, thereby hangs a tale. I don't mean the black tail which is standing upright and quivering at your caresses, but a story {{that there will be}} time to tell you before Charlie <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> market.|$|R
50|$|Güven {{works at}} an {{accounting}} firm and leads an ordinary life. He is happily married {{and has a}} daughter that he loves more than anything. He boasts endlessly to his colleagues about his daughter’s achievements. His daughter is equally devoted to him, calling him every day when she <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Lawlor {{orders a}} fruit platter to eat every day. However, when he <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the {{training}} center, he often finds it already eaten by Team Nogueira. Lawlor {{wants to get}} back at them, so he and several members of Team Mir urinate in his own fruit platter and place it in the refrigerator.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Thumble hesitated, {{and then}} made a renewed request. [...] "If you would not mind taking me to Silverbridge, I could <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> thence by railway; and perhaps you would allow your servant to take the horse to Barchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she owned, [...] "I did," [...] {{and again}} the {{vice-consul}} could say nothing. [...] "If I went, it wouldn't make any difference whether it took it all or not. I should have plenty to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> New York with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A dreary spot at night, I dare say," [...] the Prime Minister remarked, without overmuch interest. [...] "How do we <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> here, Orden? I haven't {{forgotten}} your {{warning about}} luncheon, and this air is {{giving me a}} most lively appetite." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{day of the}} John Warner Campaign visit {{turns into}} chaos. Ms. Taylor chokes on a chicken bone while Ave learns that Jack got engaged to Sweet Sue. When Ave <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the {{campaign}} disaster, her father’s sister (Aunt Alice) is waiting, calling Ave a bastard and announcing she is taking Ave to court for {{the house and the}} pharmacy.|$|R
5000|$|Later that night, Paulie has a {{dream in}} which he <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the trip and finds Big Pussy at the stove, cooking a meal. Paulie asks Pussy, [...] "When my time comes, tell me, will I stand up?" [...] Paulie awakens startled and is then shown frantically lifting weights {{in his living room}} with a scowl on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "That he will {{be delighted}} to receive us on the 1st of October. I did say {{that we should be}} ready to start in about a week's time, because I know that he <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> his autumn holiday by the middle of September. But I have no doubt he has his house full till the time he has named." ...|$|R
60|$|And as she flitted {{from room}} to room she sang such merry songs that it was a delight to hear her, and the Major was sure to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the city in time to listen to the {{strumming}} of the piano at three o'clock, from the recess of his own snug chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{him every}} day at the same time," [...] replied Lady Montfort. [...] "He {{generally}} walks down to the House of Commons with Mr. Wilton, and when they have answered questions, and he has got all {{the news of the}} lobby, he comes to me. I always manage to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> my drive to give him half an hour before dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If any of Eustace's {{party are}} trying to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Freshwater, they might save {{a couple of miles}} by coming across Welsford, instead of going by the main track, as we have done." [...] So said Amyas, who though (luckily for him) no [...] "genius," [...] was cunning as a fox in all matters of tactic and practic, and would have in these days proved his right to be {{considered}} an intellectual person by being a thorough man of business.|$|E
60|$|A fifteen minutes' walk {{brought me}} to the camp, where tents for some twenty-five {{thousand}} whiten the plain {{far as the eye can}} reach. There, too, I saw distant masses of infantry moving. I might have known by their slouchy way that they were <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> parade, not preparing for it. But I thought the latter, and lying down under a tree, waited for the review to begin.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{becoming}} more commonplace for {{the husband and wife}} to be employed in paid work and for both to share in the [...] "housework" [...] and caring for the children. However, in other families, there is still a traditional idea that housework is only a woman's job; so when a couple <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work, the wife works in the house while the man takes a rest, or uses the time for recreational pursuits.|$|R
5000|$|Saturday Night {{begins in}} a working man's club in Nottingham. Arthur Seaton is 21 years old, and enjoying {{a night out}} with Brenda, {{the wife of a}} {{colleague}} at work. Challenged to a drinking contest, Arthur defeats [...] "Loudmouth" [...] before falling down the stairs drunk. Brenda takes him home with her and they spend the night together. Arthur enjoys breakfast with Brenda before her husband Jack <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a weekend at the races.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Clementina with a pang for {{the thought}} of a meeting she had {{sometimes}} fancied there, when her lover had come out for her, and her father had been told to come and receive them. [...] "No," [...] she sighed, [...] "the'e wouldn't be time to let them know. But it wouldn't make any difference. I could <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> New Yo'k alone," [...] she added, listlessly. Her spirits had fallen again. She saw that she could not leave Venice till she had heard in some sort from the letter she had written. [...] "Perhaps it couldn't be done, after all. But I will see Mr. Bennam about it, Mr. Osson; and I know he will want you to have that much of the money. He will be coming he'e, soon." ...|$|E
60|$|The early afternoons {{were the}} worst time, from two to four, before calling began. The devil was given great power over Marjorie's early afternoon. She could even envy her former home life then, and reflect that there, at any rate, one had a chance of a game or a quarrel with Daffy or Syd or Rom or Theodore. She would pull herself {{together}} and {{go out for a}} walk, and whichever way she went there were shops and shops and shops, a glittering array of tempting opportunities for spending money. Sometimes she would give way to spending exactly as a struggling drunkard decides to tipple. She would fix on some object, some object trivial and a little rare and not too costly, as being needed--when she knew perfectly well it wasn't needed--and choose the most remotest shops and display the exactest insistence upon her requirements. Sometimes she would <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> these raids without buying at all. After four the worst of the day was over; one could call on people or people might telephone and follow up with a call; and there was a chance of Trafford coming home....|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Wanhope resumed, [...] "she {{says she}} scolded him, {{and it did}} not do the least good. She could not scold him out of that feeling, which was all mixed up in her retrospect with the sense of the weather and the season, the leaves just {{beginning}} to show the autumn, the wild asters coming to crowd the goldenrod, the crickets shrill in the grass, and the birds silent in the trees, the smell of the rowan in the meadows, and the odor of the old logs and fresh chips in the woods. She was not a woman to notice such things much, but he talked of them all and made her notice them. His nature took hold upon what we call nature, and clung fondly to the lowly and familiar aspects of it. Once she said to him, trembling for him, 'I should think you would be afraid to take such a pleasure in those things,' and when he asked her why, she couldn't or wouldn't tell him; but he understood, and he said: 'I've never realized before that I was {{so much a part of}} them. Either I am going to have them forever, or they are going to have me. We shall not part, for we are all members of the same body. If it is the body of death, we are members of that. If it is the body of life, we are members of that. Either I have never lived, or else I am never going to die.' She said: 'Of course you are never going to die; a spirit can't die.' But he told her he didn't mean that. He was just as radiantly happy when they would <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> one of their drives, and sit down to their supper, which they had country-fashion instead of dinner, and then when they would turn into their big, lamplit parlor, and sit down for a long evening with his books. Sometimes he read to her as she sewed, but he read mostly to himself, and he said he hadn't had such a bath of poetry since he was a boy. Sometimes in the splendid nights, which were so clear that you could catch the silver glint of the gossamers in the thin air, he would go out and walk up and down the long veranda. Once, when he coaxed her out with him, he took her under the arm and walked her up and down, and he said: 'Isn't it like a ship? The earth is like a ship, and we're sailing, sailing! Oh, I wonder where!' Then he stopped with a sob, and she was startled, and asked him what the matter was, but he couldn't tell her. She was more frightened than ever at what seemed a break in his happiness. She was troubled about his reading the Bible so much, especially the Old Testament; but he told her he had never known before what majestic literature it was. There were some turns or phrases in it that peculiarly took his fancy and seemed to feed it with inexhaustible suggestion. 'The Angel of the Lord' was one of these. The idea of a divine messenger, embodied and commissioned to intimate the creative will to the creature: it was sublime, it was ineffable. He wondered that men had ever come to think in any other terms of the living law that we were under, and that could much less conceivably operate like an insensate mechanism than it could reveal itself as a constant purpose. He said he believed that in every great moral crisis, in every ordeal of conscience, a man was aware of standing in the presence of something sent to try him and test him, and that this something was the Angel of the Lord.|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell continued: [...] "In {{the third}} act--for I see that I {{shall have to}} make it the third now--the scene will be in Haxard's library, after he <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the {{complimentary}} dinner, at midnight, and he finds a man waiting for him there--a man that the butler tells him has called several times, and was so anxious to see him that Mrs. Haxard has given orders to let him wait. Oh, I ought to go back a little, and explain--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{at breakfast}} when Maxwell came, {{at about the}} hour people were <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> church, and he asked the author to join him. But Maxwell had already breakfasted, and he hid his impatience of the actor's politeness {{as well as he}} could, and began at the first moment possible: [...] "The idea of my play is biblical; we're still a very biblical people." [...] He had thought of the fact in seeing so many worshippers {{swarming}} out of the churches.|$|R
50|$|One {{day when}} Mark <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work, he discovers four huge crates {{on his front}} porch. He has no idea where they could have {{possibly}} come from, after all, he has only ordered small action figures so far. He opens the crates and discovers the first four children, along with a note saying that three more toys are on their way, one is backordered, and one is recuperating. Desperately, Mark {{tried to find a}} way to return the children, but his efforts are futile.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{different}} videos for [...] "Trouble". The original features the girls trying to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> central London after a night out.

50|$|In its heyday, The Herald had a {{circulation}} of almost 600,000, {{but by the time}} of its 150th anniversary in 1990, with the impact of evening television news and a higher proportion of people using cars to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work rather than public transport, The Heralds circulation had fallen below 200,000. This was much less than that of the morning Sun.|$|E
50|$|Apparently {{because of}} Linnaeus' lack of help in <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Germany and {{his refusal to}} give his mentor access to the Surinam {{collections}} without first being offered an academic post, Rolander and Linnaeus had a severe falling-out. Linnaeus' power and prestige in the academic world {{made it possible for}} him to blackball Rolander. Thus, he was unable to gain an academic position and did not publish his findings, gradually drifting into obscurity and poverty due to a misfortune (perhaps the death of a patron he had finally found) and his apparently abrasive personality.|$|R
5000|$|Kathy then {{ends up in}} {{a jungle}} where she notices Horton the Elephant. She then reads Horton Hatches the Egg. The Cat in the Hat appears again. Soon, Kathy wanders into a room which is {{explained}} to be [...] "The World of Advertising". The Ad Man and the Ad Woman explain to Kathy about Dr. Seuss in the advertising business. The room soon rocks and Kathy is transported to Mulberry Street where she meets Marco. She helps Marco {{come up with a}} story to tell his father when he <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> walking from school.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{decided to}} accept Ozma's {{invitation}} to return {{with her to}} the Land of Oz. There was no greater chance of her <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Ev than from Oz, and the little girl was anxious to see once more the country where she had encountered such wonderful adventures. By this time Uncle Henry would have reached Australia in his ship, and had probably given her up for lost; so he couldn't worry any more than he did if she stayed away from him a while longer. So she would go to Oz.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the large}} adult audience, the usual network {{broadcast}} time of the daily [...] "Captain Video" [...] series was 7 to 7:30 p.m. EST, leading off the [...] "prime evening" [...] time block and giving parents a chance to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work before the show began. For its last two seasons the show still aired at 7 p.m. ET, but was reduced to 15-minute segments.|$|E
5000|$|Farell {{grew up in}} Cincinnati, Ohio, and [...] "couldn't wait to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> {{school to}} kibitz {{whenever}} my mother had the game at our house." [...] The family moved to Los Angeles when she was 17 and she began playing duplicate bridge there [...] "with the young men I dated". She married one of them, Arnold Kauder, who was her mentor. (They divorced.) She began teaching bridge after World War II.|$|E
50|$|Star Trek: Odyssey is a Star Trek fan {{production}} from Areakt Productions, {{the creators of}} Star Trek: Hidden Frontier. Set {{after the end of}} Hidden Frontier, Odyssey follows the USS Odyssey as it struggles to <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a dangerous mission that has taken it and her crew 2.5 million light years from home to the unknowns of the Andromeda Galaxy. This is the first Star Trek series, fan produced or otherwise, to take place outside of the Milky Way Galaxy.|$|E
5000|$|When the Taylors return home, {{strange things}} begin to happen. Bronny {{finds that the}} sink keeps turning on, and Stephanie sees handprints on a steamy mirror, both of which Mikey blames on “Jenny”. After Stephanie <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school, she vomits into a {{container}} and puts it under her bed. Bronny catches her, and she and Peter learn that Stephanie has been throwing up for a while; there are many such containers under her bed. They take Stephanie to a hospital for help, leaving Mikey at Bronny's mother's house. Bronny's mother finds Mikey trying to kill her cat, much to Peter’s disbelief.|$|R
60|$|Our {{horses were}} very tired, {{and it was}} late before we reached Mr. O'Conor's house. That <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> hunting with a {{thoroughly}} weary animal, who has no longer sympathy or example to carry him on, is very tedious work. In the present instance I had company with me; but when a man is alone, when his horse toes at every ten steps, when the night is dark and the rain pouring, and there are yet eight miles of road to be conquered,--at such time a man is almost apt to swear that he will give up hunting.|$|R
50|$|Michael <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> to {{find that}} his mother has sold his {{groceries}} for drug money. He gives her ten dollars when she tells him she is going out. She threatens to take the DSS card from him. He insists on keeping the card. When Michael <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the gym, Bug tells him that his father has returned. Michael is dismayed and repulsed when the man goes to touch him. He shares a disbelieving glance with his mother. Michael confronts his mother, telling her that she has broken her promise by allowing Bug’s father to return. She is unconcerned and tells Michael {{that things are going}} back to the way they were. Michael is stunned and she says that people change and tells Michael that Bug’s father will now hold the DSS card.|$|R
