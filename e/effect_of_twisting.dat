Hooking the lantern to his belt behind, {{in such a way that}} its light was concealed, he kneeled down beside the diver--who, he had no doubt, was the Jem Hogg mentioned to him by Baldwin--and rested his helmet on the rock, in such a way that the side of it was brought into contact with the back of Jem's head-piece. No sooner did it touch than the snoring became audible. Feeling assured, therefore, of success, our hero drew in a long breath and gave vent to a Red-Indian yell that rendered himself completely deaf. Its effect on the sleeper was electric. Edgar could just hear the beginning of a responsive yell of terror when Jem's springing up separated the helmets and produced silence. At first the scared man stood up and stared right before him in a state of wild amazement, while Edgar took care to stand directly behind him, out of sight. A man in a diving-dress cannot turn his head round so as to look over his shoulder. When he wishes to see behind him he must needs turn round. Seeing nothing in front to account for the alarming sound, Jem began to turn, but Edgar knew that this motion would have the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> their lines and pipes together. He therefore seized Jem suddenly round the chest, and, being a much larger and stronger man, held him like a vice in the grasp of his left arm while he pommelled him heartily with his right all over the back and ribs. At the same time he punished him considerably with his knees, and then, a sudden fancy striking him, he placed his helmet against that of Jem, and began to laugh, howl, and yell like a maniac, the laughter being rendered very real and particularly effective owing to the shrieks of terror which he then heard issuing from the horrified diver. Not content with this he seized his lantern and passed it smartly in front of his victim's front-glass, in the hope that the unwonted and unaccountable glare might add to his consternation. That he had not failed in his intention was made plain by the shock which he immediately felt thrilling Jem's frame from head to foot.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{toroidal}} plasma to {{be effectively}} confined by a magnetic field, {{there must be}} a twist to the field lines. There are then no longer flux tubes that simply encircle the axis, but, if there is sufficient symmetry in the twist, flux surfaces. Some of the plasma in a flux surface will be on the outside (larger major radius, or [...] "low-field side") of the torus and will drift to other flux surfaces farther from the circular axis of the torus. Other portions of the plasma in the flux surface will be on the inside (smaller major radius, or [...] "high-field side"). Since some of the outward drift is compensated by an inward drift on the same flux surface, there is a macroscopic equilibrium with much improved confinement. Another way to look at the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> the field lines is that the electric field between the top and the bottom of the torus, which tends to cause the outward drift, is shorted out because there are now field lines connecting the top to the bottom.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic twist {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in many structures of the solar atmosphere. One <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is to modify the properties of the eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions are characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement along the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the development of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is oscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced either by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of the sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or either by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when there is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is consistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the process of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist always delays the appearance of the shear instability but for tubes with thin inhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values <b>of</b> <b>twist.</b> On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> is much stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations of transverse kink modes and the KHI itself. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ (11 - 22 - 2017...|$|R

This paper explores the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>twist</b> on the static strength and fatigue life of studless chain. It reports test results for 16 mm studless chain (with similar proportions as the much larger chains now employed in hydrocarbon production vessels) with known levels <b>of</b> initial <b>twist</b> subject to axial tensile loading. <b>Twist</b> levels <b>of</b> up to 24 ° per link were examined. The results were generally better than had been expected. There was little scatter in the results, giving confidence in the test procedures.

The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>twist</b> on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture. While {{the results of these}} small scale tests suggest that twist levels up to 24 ° per link were not detrimental, other practical reasons remain for continuing to minimize twist in mooring chain.

40|$|Abstract: Occupational {{exposure}} to whole-body vibration is often {{combined with a}} requirement to perform twisting actions. This paper reports a study where the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> on the biomechanical response of the seated person was investigated. Twelve male subjects were exposed to vertical random whole-body vibration at 0. 4 m/s 2 r. m. s. Each subject sat in four different postures: ‘back-on’, ‘backoff’, ‘twist ’ (where subjects were required to twist the torso by 90 °) and ‘move ’ (where subjects were required to performing a moving task with extended arms). Similar apparent masses were measured for the ‘back-on’, ‘back-off ’ and ‘twist ’ conditions, where a peak occurred at about 6 Hz. For the ‘move ’ condition, the peak in the apparent mass was attenuated indicating a different biomechanical response in this posture. The 6 Hz peak in fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass was eliminated in the ‘move ’ condition. It is suggested that the change in biomechanical response is due to either the extended arms acting as a passive vibration absorber or that the twisting action interferes with the usual acceleration-muscle feedback system. Further work {{will be required to}} test these hypotheses...|$|E

Two sets of experiments were performed; the first set of experiments was conducted to study the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> angle and temperature on the film's electromechanical performance. The other set of experiments was conducted to study the effect of temperature in the absence of cyclic twisting deformation. The change in electrical resistance increased with number of twisting cycles and twisting angle. In addition, the highest change in electrical resistance was observed for samples subjected to cyclic fatigue at 100 °C, which is attributed to crack growth and oxidation of the Ag-alloy layer. The cracks were observed to initiate not only from coating defects but also from edge defects. Development of cracks is accelerated due to the combined effects of the external repeated stress and temperature. Therefore, it is suggested that controlling temperature when using ITO/Ag-alloy/ITO thin film under mechanical stress is important for electrical device performance; temperatures in both fabrication and use should not exceed 50 °C...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We study a {{filament}} eruption, two-ribbon flare, and coronal mass ejection (CME) {{that occurred}} in Active Region NOAA 10898 on 6 July 2006. The filament was located South of a strong sunspot that dominated the region. In the evolution {{leading up to the}} eruption, and for some time after it, a counter-clockwise rotation of the sunspot of about 30 degrees was observed. We suggest that the rotation triggered the eruption by progressively expanding the magnetic field above the filament. To test this scenario, we study the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> the initially potential field overlying a pre-existing flux-rope, using three-dimensional zero–β MHD simulations. We first consider a relatively simple and symmetric system, and then study a more complex and asymmetric magnetic configuration, whose photospheric flux distribution and coronal structure are guided by the observations and a potential field extrapolation. In both cases, we find that the twisting leads to the expansion of the overlying field. As a consequence of the progressively reduced magnetic tension, the flux-rope quasi-statically adapts to the changed environmental field, rising slowly. Once the tension is sufficiently reduced, a distinct second phase of evolution occurs where the flux-rope enters an unstable regime characterized by a strong acceleration. Our simulations thus suggest a new mechanism for the triggering of eruptions in the vicinity of rotating sunspots...|$|E

The stability and perturbation increments have been found. Rux jumps in intemally cooled composite superconductors R. G. Mints and/EL. Ra'khmanov It is known h 2 that thermomagnetic instabilities, flux jumps, may arise in hard superconductors or superconducting composites. In the case of composites, the stability criterion strongly depends on the external cooling. For this reason, the cooling channels in conductors consisting of composite wires are usually provided in the bulk of the material. The present paper {{is concerned with}} the stability of such conduc-tors with respect to small perturbations covering {{a large portion of the}} sample volume. Although similar, this problem is different from the cryostatic stability which has been discussed in the literature 3. To initiate the instability in question, there must be an initial perturbation covering the entire sample cross-section and having a longitudinal dimension greater than the cross-section perimeter 2. Such a perturbation may be brought about by a flux jump in individual sample elements caused by current input and output, displacement of coil turns, etc. Note that this presentation of the problem eliminates the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> on the stability ~'s To find the stability criterion one has to derive the equations describing the evolution of small perturbations of the electric field E and the temperature T.

Both monocore and multifilamentary (Pb,Bi) - 2223 silver-sheathed superconducting tapes have been processed and characterised. The relative conversion of (Pb,Bi) - 2212 to (Pb,Bi) - 2223 has been measured using X-Ray diffraction. The critical current density and the associated magnetic field dependence have also been measured. The parameters investigated include the stoichiometry of the precursor powder, the mechanical deformation of multifilamentary tapes, the effect of the cooling rate, and the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> a multifilamentary tape. Two precursor powders were compared. The Endo composition powder ((Pb_ 0 _. _ 3 _ 4,Bi_ 1 _. _ 8 _ 4) Sr_ 1 _. _ 9 _ 1 Ca_ 2 _. _ 0 _ 3 Cu_ 3 _. _ 0 _ 6 O_x) and a second powder, that had an additional 10 % excess of (Pb,Bi) - 2212 added to the Endo composition ((Pb_ 0 _. _ 3 _ 7 _ 4,Bi_ 2 _. _ 0 _ 2 _ 4) Sr_ 2 _. _ 1 _ 0 _ 1 Ca_ 2 _. _ 1 _ 3 _ 3 Cu_ 3 _. _ 2 _ 6 _ 6 O_y). Both the Endo and 10 % excess precursor powders were packed into thin, and thick silver sheaths, and a silver alloy (Ag(99. 5 %), Ni(0. 2 %), Mg(0. 28 %)). Of the three separate studies the thick silver sheath samples produced the best results for both precursor powders. The Endo composition tapes had better characteristics than the 10 % excess tapes, with an l_c of 17 A and 14 A, respectively. The mechanical deformation experienced by 37 filament multifilamentary tapes before thermal processing was studied. The final wire diameter, the rolling steps used to convert the wire to a tape were investigated. It was found that tapes with thin, high aspect ration filaments produced a higher critical current density. High aspect ration filaments were produced within the conductor using small rolling steps of 20 #mu#m followed by one or two 100 #mu#m steps to the as-rolled thickness. Through attempting to optimise both the diameter and the rolling regime a 20 % improvement in the J_c was obtained from 12 KAcm"-" 2 to 14. 5 KAcm"-" 2. Using the improved deformation scheme from the above tapes were subjected to various cooling rates. The magnetic field dependence of the tapes was improved using a slow cooling rate (1 deg C/hr 818 - 730 deg C). The critical current density of the tapes could be improved from a maximum of 13 KAcm"-" 2 to 15. 5 KAcm"-" 2 when a secondary dwell was applied. The maximum J_c obtained for twisted tapes was 6. 5 KAcm"-" 2 this is far lower than those obtained for untwisted tapes. The increased deformation and elongation of the filaments is believed to be responsible for this effect. The filaments of a twisted tape were observed to remain uncoupled to a field of 10 mT at 43 Hz, producing lower losses than the theoretical plot for an untwisted tape.

This exploration of action is helpful for the artist to better understand the exertions <b>of</b> muscles, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> on the body, and the natural range of motion in the joints. Basically, it is a method of training hands to sketch what the brain has already seen. Staying [...] "focused" [...] means sustained concentration. Gesture drawings may take as long as two minutes, or as short as five seconds, depending on what the focus of the exercise is.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwisted tape inserts {{are widely}} used for {{enhancing}} heat transfer in heat exchangers. They enhance heat transfer by inducing swirl flow in the flow channel, thereby enabling good mixing within the fluid and by increasing the effective flow length of the flow channel. They also increase pressure drop but their overall performance {{is found to be}} advantageous in many cases. In this work, an attempt is made to analyse the performance of a modified double pipe heat exchanger with twisted tape induced swirl flow on both sides. The numerical analysis were done in turbulent flow conditions with <b>twisted</b> tape inserts <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> ratio 5 and 3. The results obtained are validated using established correlations available in the literature. The fin <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> tape is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Twist 1 is a {{transcription}} factor {{that is highly}} expressed in murine brown and white adipose tissue (WAT) and negatively regulates fatty acid oxidation in mice. The role <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> 1 in WAT is not known and was therefore examined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The expression <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> 1 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in different tissues and in different cell types within adipose tissue. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> 1 small interfering RNA on fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, adipokine secretion, and mRNA expression was determined in human adipocytes. The interaction between twist 1 and specific promoters in human adipocytes was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter assays. RESULTS—Twist 1 was highly expressed in human WAT compared {{with a set of}} other tissues and found predominantly in adipocytes. Twist 1 levels increased during in vitro differentiatio...|$|R
