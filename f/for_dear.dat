25|$|The {{idea for}} the book {{originated}} with her publisher, Simon & Schuster, {{who were interested in}} a follow-up to Clinton's best-selling 1996 volume It Takes a Village. It also followed in the pawsteps of prior First Lady Barbara Bush's popular 1990 effort Millie's Book, about the prior White House dog. Plans <b>for</b> <b>Dear</b> Socks, Dear Buddy were announced in June 1998 and it was stated that Linda Kulman, a reporter based in Washington, would assist Clinton in the writing.

25|$|The Shooting, {{also known}} as Dear Sister, was {{broadcast}} during an episode aired April 14, 2007. The short satirizes the final scene of The O.C.s second-season finale. The Lonely Island had had {{the idea for the}} short before even being hired by Saturday Night Live and had previously recorded their own version of the short. The NBC network, which usually uploads Saturday Night Live digital shorts to its official site and YouTube channel immediately following broadcast, did not do so <b>for</b> <b>Dear</b> Sister due to music clearance issues. It nevertheless became immensely popular on YouTube with artists making parodies, re-enactments and other references.|$|E

2500|$|Potts' initial task {{had been}} to retake the village of Kokoda. In the end the 25th Brigade walked in and took vacant {{possession}} on 2 November, the Japanese having abandoned it some time before. The Japanese were by now a shadow of the powerful force that had faced Potts in August. The survivors were riddled with dysentery and starving. Some evidence points to cannibalism. Japanese war correspondent Seizo Okada reported that after receiving the order to return to Buna, [...] "for a time the soldiers remained stupefied among the rocks on the mountain side.

2500|$|The premiere {{received}} mixed {{response from}} critics, with some finding {{it hard to}} get used to a reboot, while others praised the new directions. Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic wrote a positive review for the episode, giving it a 4.2 out of 5 stars rating and stating, [...] "With a new location and characters, the show is returning to its former glory. My only hope is that if this season {{turns out to be a}} success, they do not drag the stories on <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> life." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Justin Kirkland gave a A- letter rating along with a favorable commentary. Emmaline Harvey of SpoilerTV eulogized the reboot, saying, [...] "I felt Once was starting to get repetitive the last few seasons, and while this is nearly identical to the plot in the plot, I'm really encouraged by the new characters. I think it's a fun, fresh new start to the series." [...] Nick Hogan of TVOvermind gave the episode a 4 out of 5 stars rating, labeling it as a new pilot and glorifying Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz's ability of [...] "make a quality episode of television." [...] Conversely, Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club deemed the new settings and storylines [...] "hard to sell," [...] providing a C letter rating.|$|E
2500|$|Rubber {{chickens}} {{served as}} the rating system for the show until February 2015. As such, {{at the end of}} the review a rubber chicken rating (a number out of 10) is given to the game. The games that have received a perfect score (10 out of 10 rubber chickens from season 1–10; 5 out of 5 stars from season 11 onward) from both hosts include: Super Mario Bros., , Portal 2, , Mass Effect 3, Black Mesa, Halo 4, Tomb Raider, The Last of Us, Grand Theft Auto V, , , , The Beginner's Guide, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and [...] The Stanley Parable is also notable for receiving 10 out of 10 rubber chickens from Goose, who reviewed the game independently. The lowest rated games include: [...] (Bajo – 1; Hex – 1.5), Naughty Bear (Bajo – 1.5; Hex – 1), Muscle March (Bajo – 1; Hex – 0), and ET (Bajo – 1; Junglist – 0). From time to time, unorthodox ratings have been given to games. These include when Bajo gave a [...] "not sure" [...] and Hex gave an 8791 for Robot Unicorn Attack, when Bajo gave a [...] "wispy breeze" [...] and Hex gave a [...] "picture of a tree" [...] <b>for</b> <b>Dear</b> Esther, and when DayZ (a Mod for ARMA 2) was not rated and the score screen {{at the end of the}} episode showed the death screen from game. In February 2015, the scoring system was changed from a 10 Rubber Chicken variation, to a five-star system, with the Rubber Chicken still being referred to, via the [...] "Golden Rubber Chicken" [...] award, given to games receiving perfect five-out-of-five scores from both presenters. The establishment of this new scoring system differs between classic Good Game and Good Game Spawn Point. The former implies that the new method is derived from the now-concluded [...] "At the Movies" [...] scoring system, also based around five star ratings, while the latter attributes the updated scoring system to DARREN taking a symposium on scoring methods.|$|E
