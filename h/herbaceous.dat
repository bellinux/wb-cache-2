5|$|Fifty-seven {{percent of}} the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is composed of deciduous forest. Areas of perennial <b>herbaceous</b> vegetation make up 11 to 12 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed. Additionally, there are scattered patches of mixed vegetation and annual <b>herbaceous</b> vegetation in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, and gravel pits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Herbaceous</b> {{and woody}} plants, many {{uncommon}} in the Ithaca area, such as Vancouveria hexanra and Stuartia pseudocamellia.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis survives in {{and presumably}} prefers cool, {{partially}} sunlit areas of lush <b>herbaceous</b> growth within the spray {{zone of the}} Falls.|$|E
5|$|Some {{areas of}} the {{riparian}} buffer of Eddy Creek contain woody <b>herbaceous</b> plants. Strip mine overburden piles covered in forests also occur in the creek's riparian area.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in <b>herbaceous</b> borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to {{reproduce}} vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|E
5|$|Fields near {{overwintering}} {{sites such}} as woody and <b>herbaceous</b> environment, and storage facilities, present increased risk of B. rufimanus colonization, particularly in areas with high infestation the precedent year.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} species of Orthoptera identified, two are {{considered}} heritage: the sickle-bearing bush cricket (Phaneroptera falcata), {{rare in the}} region, enjoys the dry and high <b>herbaceous</b> areas and the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis) is a pioneer species of poor vegetation settings.|$|E
5|$|The new Memorial Gardens {{incorporate}} the war memorial which was moved from Victoria Square {{as part of}} the project. The planting employs a naturalistic style with broad drifts of <b>herbaceous</b> perennials and grasses providing colour through a long season, extending through the winter with dry stems and seed heads.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the <b>herbaceous</b> border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy <b>herbaceous</b> plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, <b>herbaceous,</b> rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} <b>herbaceous</b> plant species in riparian areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|Many tall palms are <b>herbaceous</b> monocots; {{these do}} not undergo {{secondary}} growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the terminal bud {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other <b>herbaceous</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus is a genus of {{perennial}} <b>herbaceous</b> bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a maximum height of 5–8cm, while Narcissus tazetta may grow as tall as 80cm.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{the central}} gravel {{area is a}} flight of steps to the {{historical}} rose garden, now planted with <b>herbaceous</b> plants. North of the formal garden, there is a rock and water garden, built in the 20th century, with a seating grotto in the north-west corner. There is a gravel path from the water garden which returns to the house, originally with a pergola, now gone.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} <b>herbaceous</b> plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E
5|$|There is an <b>herbaceous</b> wetland along Abrahams Creek just {{upstream}} {{of where}} it enters Frances Slocum Lake. Further to the north, there is a flooded forested wetland. The creek has a substantial riparian buffer upstream of Frances Slocum Lake. The plant species Carex disperma inhabits the area. Bird species such as Virginia rail and Sora inhabit the area as well.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and <b>herbaceous</b> perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an <b>herbaceous,</b> Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E
5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are saprobic on <b>herbaceous</b> or woody tissues. The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. He conceded, however, {{that he had not}} examined any specimens.|$|E
5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, <b>herbaceous</b> plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with grass and herbs.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of <b>herbaceous</b> vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown {{worldwide}} for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, <b>herbaceous,</b> rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or <b>herbaceous</b> perennials. Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, <b>herbaceous</b> perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the <b>herbaceous</b> areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} <b>herbaceous</b> legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its {{tolerance}} for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and <b>herbaceous</b> ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to {{mountain}} streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending {{much time in}} the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators. In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are more likely to occur in wetlands with more <b>herbaceous</b> cover, visual obstruction, and nearby grasslands. The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide. Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginia's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000ft) channels between islands.|$|E
5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The <b>herbaceous</b> fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a <b>herbaceous</b> garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum (common names white trillium, large-flowered trillium, {{great white}} trillium, white wake-robin, French trille blanc) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Melanthiaceae. A monocotyledonous, <b>herbaceous</b> perennial, it is native to eastern North America, from northern Quebec to the southern parts of the United States through the Appalachian Mountains into northernmost Georgia and west to Minnesota. It also thrives on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. There are also several isolated populations, such as in Nova Scotia and Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different <b>herbaceous</b> fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and <b>herbaceous</b> plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the <b>herbaceous</b> and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or <b>herbaceous</b> side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
