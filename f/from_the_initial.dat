5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> shotgun blast.|$|E
5|$|By March 2003, the {{cheapest}} fare from the UK was £59 return, available all year around. In June 2009 {{it was announced}} that one-way single fares would be available at £31 at {{the cheapest}}. Competition between Eurostar and airline services was a large factor in ticket prices being reduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> levels.|$|E

5|$|Tri-ang, {{and later}} Hornby, have {{produced}} 'OO'-scale models of Flying Scotsman almost continuously since the 1960s. In the 2000s, Hornby also produced live steam examples, re-using the chassis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> LNER Class A4 models. Other manufacturers have produced models in other scales, such as Minitrix (N-gauge) and Bassett-Lowke (O-gauge).|$|E

5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

Over {{the course of the}} next three days, severe {{fighting}} took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is {{too slow to}} cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E

5|$|It took {{sixteen years}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{developing}} stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire {{cost of the}} bridge totaled $336 million. In 2011, the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun, {{and is expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times, the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and at least two workers have died.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

5|$|Pakistani {{authorities}} {{tried to}} contact their NATO counterparts {{in an effort to}} inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force. The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again. A short while later communication with the NATO commanders was established and the attack was called off. All casualties were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> attack on the Volcano border post. Later, Major General Abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why the NATO forces returned to attack the second time.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version {{armed with}} two DT tank machine guns. The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of the}} T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, California. The weather {{was clear and}} unseasonably warm for San Francisco in late December, but the field was soggy after several days of rain. In the first seven minutes of the game, Air Force scored 10consecutive points to take an early 10–0 lead. The Tech defense {{eventually}} clamped down on the Falcons' offense, however, and only allowed three points {{for the remainder of}} the game. The Virginia Tech offense slowly climbed back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> 10-point deficit, scoring a touchdown in the first quarter and a field goal in the second. By halftime, the Hokies had equalized the score at 10–10.|$|E
