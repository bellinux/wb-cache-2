5|$|In India simple {{artificial}} plant classification {{systems of}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical {{with the work of}} Parashara (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of Vṛksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (<b>Fabaceae),</b> Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.|$|E
5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull planks was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the <b>Fabaceae</b> family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of wood that have been {{positively}} identified: teak (Tectona grandis) {{was used for the}} through-beams and is resilient to the teredo worm (the Teredinidae family), the ceiling was made from a Cupressus genus which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the Leguminosae family (now called the <b>Fabaceae)</b> and either the Dalbergia or Pterocarpus genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an Artocarpus genus of the family Moraceae, more commonly known as the Mulberry family.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, <b>Fabaceae,</b> Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (<b>Fabaceae),</b> the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} fossils {{that can}} be definitively assigned to the <b>Fabaceae</b> appeared in the late Palaeocene (approximately 56 million years ago). Representatives of the 3 sub-families traditionally recognised as being members of the <b>Fabaceae</b> – Cesalpinioideae, Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae — as well {{as members of the}} large clades within these sub-families – such as the genistoides – have been found in periods a little later, starting between 55 and 50 million years ago. In fact, a wide variety of taxa representing the main lineages in the <b>Fabaceae</b> have been found in the fossil record dating from the middle to the late Eocene, suggesting {{that the majority of the}} modern <b>Fabaceae</b> groups were already present and that a broad diversification occurred during this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} flora {{are from the}} Caesalpinaceae, Mimosaceae, Moraceae, <b>Fabaceae</b> and Euphorbiaceae families.|$|E
25|$|There {{was rich}} {{biodiversity}} among the Myrtaceae, Orchidaceae, <b>Fabaceae,</b> Asteraceae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae, Rubiaceae and Bromeliaceae.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fabaceae</b> (or Leguminosae) and Euphorbiaceae are the {{dominant}} families of plants observed in igapó forest.|$|E
25|$|Include the {{spectacular}} neotropical Morpho, its food plants include the Arecaceae, Bignoniaceae, <b>Fabaceae,</b> Menispermaceae, Poaceae, and Sapindaceae.|$|E
25|$|Dismorphiinae (six genera), mostly Neotropical; {{this group}} {{includes}} several mimetic species. The host plants {{are in the}} family <b>Fabaceae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the <b>Fabaceae</b> {{started their}} {{diversification}} approximately 60 {{million years ago}} {{and the most important}} clades separated some 50 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} number of species were in the <b>Fabaceae</b> family (22), followed by the Rubiaceae (10), Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae and Sapindaceae (8), and the Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae (7).|$|E
25|$|The {{larval food}} plants of Papilio demoleus in Asia are from family Rutaceae while in Australia and Papua New Guinea the {{butterfly}} also feeds on host-plants of family <b>Fabaceae.</b>|$|E
25|$|The order Fabales {{contains}} around 7.3% of eudicot {{species and}} the greatest part of this diversity is contained in {{just one of the}} four families that order contains: <b>Fabaceae.</b> This clade also includes the Polygalaceae, Surianaceae and Quillajaceae families and its origins date back 94 to 89 million years, although it started its diversification some 79 to 74 million years ago. In fact, the <b>Fabaceae</b> have diversified during the early tertiary to become a ubiquitous part of the modern earth’s biota, along with many other families belonging to the flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) is a leguminous tree in {{the family}} <b>Fabaceae</b> {{indigenous}} to tropical Africa. The genus Tamarindus is a monotypic taxon, having only a single species.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fabaceae</b> have an {{abundant}} and diverse fossil record, {{especially for the}} Tertiary period. Fossils of flowers, fruit, leaves, wood and pollen from this period {{have been found in}} numerous locations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fabaceae</b> have an {{essentially}} worldwide distribution, being found everywhere except Antarctica {{and the high}} arctic. The trees are often found in tropical regions, while the herbaceous plants and shrubs are predominant outside the tropics.|$|E
25|$|Proteoid roots or cluster roots: dense {{clusters}} of rootlets of limited growth that develop under low phosphate or low iron conditions in Proteaceae and some plants {{from the following}} families Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Moraceae, <b>Fabaceae</b> and Myricaceae.|$|E
25|$|Tropical canopy butterflies, the {{caterpillars}} {{often have}} head spines or projections. Mostly edible species, have some Batesian mimics. Host plants {{are in the}} families Annonaceae, Celastraceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, <b>Fabaceae,</b> Flacourtiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Piperaceae, Poaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Santalaceae, and Sapindaceae.|$|E
25|$|It occurs {{naturally}} in the peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii), the San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi), the Peruvian torch (Echinopsis peruviana), {{and in a}} number of other members of the Cactaceae plant family. It is also found in small amounts in certain members of the <b>Fabaceae</b> (bean) family, including Acacia berlandieri.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{dormancy}} or {{hard seed}} coats occurs when seeds are impermeable to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted {{in response to}} environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include Anacardiaceae, Cannaceae, Convulvulaceae, <b>Fabaceae</b> and Malvaceae.|$|E
25|$|Certain plants, namely <b>Fabaceae,</b> form root nodules {{in order}} to {{associate}} and form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. Due to the high energy required to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel the process. In return, the plant takes nitrogen compounds produced from ammonia by the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{begins by}} briefly {{describing}} the vegetation of the Swan River Colony, noting its richness in Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, <b>Fabaceae</b> (especially Acacia), Epacridaceae, Goodeniaceae and Asteraceae. Brown then notes the more prominent plants not in these families, {{in the course}} of which he transfers from Loranthus the well-known and unusual parasitic tree Nuytsia floribunda (West Australian Christmas Tree).|$|E
25|$|The flowers {{often have}} five {{generally}} fused sepals and five free petals. They are generally hermaphrodite, {{and have a}} short hypanthium, usually cup shaped. There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. <b>Fabaceae</b> are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), and the flowers are usually showy to attract pollinators.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} vegetation of the Warren {{region is}} the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), at 90m the tallest trees in Australia, {{in association with}} the three tingle trees, which are endemic to this coast: rates tingle (E.brevistylis), red tingle (E.jacksonii) and yellow tingle (E.guilfoylei). Karri has a thick undergrowth of flowers and shrubs such as coral vine (Kennedia coccinea). The most important plant families are <b>Fabaceae</b> (including the colourful Wisteria), Orchidaceae, Mimosaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} on various species of <b>Fabaceae</b> plants. These include acacias such as A. caesia, A. catechu (black cutch) and A. farnesiana (heedle bush), Adenanthera pavonina, Albizia {{species such as}} A. chinensis, A. corniculata, A. julibrissin (nemu tree) and A. lebbeck (siris or lebbeck), Caesalpinia species such as C. bonduc, C. major and C. regia, Delonix regia (gulmohar), Grewia species, Leucaena leucocephala (white popinac), Peltophorum pterocarpum (copperpod), Pithecellobium clypearia and Pithecellobium dulce (monkeypod).|$|E
25|$|The {{subfamily}} Baroniinae {{is represented}} by the sole representative species Baronia brevicornis. They are unique in the family to use the <b>Fabaceae</b> (Leguminosae) as their larval host plants. The Baronninae and the extinct subfamily Praepapilioninae share many external similarities and are traditionally considered to be the most primitive subfamilies and sister {{to the rest of the}} swallowtails. Recent research suggests that this may not be the case, the Baroniinae being closely related to only the Parnassiinae, and Praepapilio to only the Papilionini and neither taxa being sister to the rest of the swallowtails.|$|E
25|$|Melliferous plants offer nectar to {{bees and}} other insects to {{encourage}} them to carry pollen from the flowers of one plant to others thereby ensuring pollination.A number of legume species are good nectar providers such as alfalfa, white clover, sweet clover and various Prosopis species. Many plants in the <b>Fabaceae</b> family are an important source of pollen for the bumblebee species Bombus hortorum. This bee species is especially fond of one species in particular; Trifolium pratense, also known as red clover, is a popular food source in the diet of Bombus hortorum.|$|E
25|$|Sage grouse {{are highly}} {{selective}} grazers, choosing {{only a few}} plant genera. Dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), legumes (<b>Fabaceae),</b> yarrow (Achillea spp.) and wild lettuce (Lactuca spp.) account {{for most of their}} forb intake. From July to September, dandelion comprised 45% of forb intake; sagebrush comprised 34%. Collectively, dandelion, sagebrush, and two legume genera (Trifolium and Astragalus) contributed more than 90% of the greater sage-grouse diet. Insects are a minor diet item for adults. Insects comprised 2% of the adult diet in spring and fall and 9% in summer. Sagebrush made up 71% of the year-round diet.|$|E
25|$|Adults use a {{wide range}} of food sources, most preferring to nectar on sturdy plants with red or pink flowers. Many members of the {{families}} Apocynaceae, Asteraceae and <b>Fabaceae</b> are used as common nectar sources. Males participate in a behavior called puddling, in which they congregate on mud, damp gravel or puddles. They extract sodium ions and amino acids from these sources which aid in reproduction. Males that puddle are typically fresh, and puddle only for their first couple of days. Females will occasionally puddle, but do not form congregations. Adults have also been seen feeding on dung, carrion, and urine.|$|E
25|$|The swallow-tailed hummingbird mainly forages at mid-levels, {{but good}} food sources are {{exploited}} from anywhere near ground level {{right up to}} the tree tops. It chiefly feeds on flower nectar, particularly from <b>Fabaceae,</b> Gesneriaceae, Malvaceae (especially Bombacoideae and Malvoideae), Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae and epiphytic Bromeliaceae. It is not a very specialized feeder however, and has also been recorded from plants of other families, such as Asteraceae or Caryocaraceae. It utilizes flowers of native {{as well as those of}} some introduced ornamental plants. It will also take insects caught by hawking. In south-eastern Brazil where it is plentiful even in urban parks and gardens, it is commonly attracted to hummingbird feeders.|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (<b>Fabaceae).</b> In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|Most of the park’s vegetation, {{especially}} around the canyon, is dense tropical rainforest. Most species {{found in the}} park {{are members of the}} <b>Fabaceae</b> family with 59 species and the Asteraceae family with 25 species, which reflect the abundance of these families statewide. Other important families include the Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae, each with 22 species, the Convolvulaceae family with 17 species, and the Cactaceae with 11 species. 122 species are considered valuable as ornamental plants with 46 having medicinal uses and 31 species valuable for logging. These mostly come from the rainforest areas. The rainforest vegetation is mostly deciduous, shedding leaves in the dry season. However, there are perennial rainforests, forests of pine and oak, grasslands (mostly induced) and areas with secondary vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Favorite food plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, <b>Fabaceae,</b> Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E
