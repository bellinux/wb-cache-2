They allow manufacturers to create proprietary messages which provide control over their equipment {{in a way that is}} more thorough than is provided for by standard MIDI messages.

Each manufacturer has a unique identifier that is included in its SysEx messages, which helps ensure that the messages will be heard only by the targeted device, and ignored by all others. Many instruments also include a SysEx <b>ID</b> <b>setting,</b> which allows two devices of the same model to be addressed independently while connected to the same system. SysEx messages may include functionality beyond what the MIDI standard provides. They are targeted at a specific instrument, and are ignored by all other devices on the system.|$|E

30|$|Our MOOC 8.MReV {{contains}} around 10 “office hour” {{videos of}} ~ 10  min each (but no lecture videos). In each office hour video, the instructor tutors two {{students on a}} challenging problem from either the homework or the quiz of that particular unit. This tutoring format is inspired by research on tutorial videos (Muldner et al. 2014), showing that in the right condition, the learning outcome from tutorial videos is {{comparable to that of}} live human tutoring. We observed that our tutoring videos often had a relatively slow tempo with frequent pauses while the instructor stops to think or waits for student responses. We hypothesized that this results from the high cognitive load incurred on the instructor by this tutoring setting, in which the instructor has to control multiple aspects of the presentation and interaction with the students while explaining the content at the same time. We call this setup the instructor-dominant (ID) setup. To remediate the cognitive overload problem, we changed the video shooting setting and replaced the students in the <b>ID</b> <b>setting</b> with a well-prepared student assistant who shared a lot of the instructor’s load, allowing the instructor to focus on content delivery.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Fire setters {{who have}} an {{intellectual}} disability (ID) are often identified as posing a particular danger to the community although relatively {{little is known about}} their characteristics, treatment, and support needs. Methodology: This study describes the characteristics of 134 residents of low, medium, and high security ID facilities in the United Kingdom who have either an index offence of arson, comparing them with those who have a violentn index offence, involving either violent or a sexual indexal offenceding. Findings: Index arson offenders who had an ID had multiple prior convictions, a history of violent offending, and a high likelihood of having a comorbid mental disorder. There were many shared characteristics across the three groups. Practical implications: The current study suggests that offenders who have <b>ID</b> who <b>set</b> fires have treatment needs that {{are similar to those of}} violent and sex offenders. It follows that fire setters {{who have an}} ID may also benefit from participating in more established offending behaviour treatment programs, such as cognitive behaviour therapy programs, developed for other types of offender. Originality: This study is one of the few which has investigated the characteristics and treatment needs of persons who have an <b>ID</b> who <b>set</b> fires. In particular, it is one of the first to compare the characteristics and treatment needs for persons with <b>ID</b> who <b>set</b> fires, to those who have committed violent and sexual offences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is a {{data mining}} task {{that is used}} to find frequently-occurring subsets amongst a {{database}} of itemsets. FIM is a non-numerical data intensive computation and is frequently used in machine learning and computational biology applications. The development of increasingly efficient FIM algorithms is an active field, but exposing and exploiting parallelism is not often emphasized in the development of new FIM algorithms. In this paper, we explore parallel implementations of two FIM algorithms, Apriori and Eclat, each using three different representations: vertical transaction <b>id</b> <b>set,</b> vertical bitvector, and diffset. We implemented these algorithms using OpenMP and evaluated their resultant scalability on the 4096 -core Intel Nehalem-EX SGI Altix shared-memory machine Teragrid “Blacklight ” using 16 processors (one blade) to 256 processors (16 blades) and reported our results. We found that, while scalability generally depends on the input data, Apriori is only scalable when used with diffset. On the other side, Eclat is generally scalable but achieves its best scalability with diffset. Keywords-Frquent Itemset Mining; Apriori; Eclat; shared memory; parallel I...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{extent to}} which people with {{intellectual}} disabilities (<b>ID)</b> <b>set</b> fires is difficult to ascertain. However, services working with people with ID and offending or quasi-offending histories are {{increasing the amount of}} attention that they give to this difficult and perplexing issue. This is due to the real and perceived threat that it presents to society and the seriousness with which it viewed by the criminal justice system. Aim: Against this background there is very little available in the research literature concerning treatment interventions for fire-setting behaviour in this client group, and even less regarding their effectiveness. Method: In the current study 14 men and women with mild and borderline ID, convictions for arson and detained in a hospital low secure service were offered and completed a broadly cognitive behavioural, approximately 40 -session group-based intervention. The treatment was aimed primarily at reducing fire interest and attitudes associated with fire-setting behaviour. Participants were assessed pre- and post-treatment on a number of fire-specific, anger, self-esteem and depression measures. Results: Following treatment, significant improvements were found in all areas assessed, excepting depression. Despite the limitations of the study design, the results provide encouragement and some guidance to practitioners who are required to develop interventions for this challenging, yet much neglected client group...|$|R

To avoid this problem we are proposing a method for face detection irrespective of illumination variations. In this context the contribution of the work is twofold. First we introduce illumination invariant Local Structure Features for face detection. For an efficient computation we propose a Modified Census Transform which enhances the original work of Zabih and Wood [11]. Secondly we introduceanefficient face detection classifier for rapid detection to render high performance face detection rate. The Classifier structure is much simpler because we use only single stage classifier than multi-stage approaches, while having similar capabilities.
