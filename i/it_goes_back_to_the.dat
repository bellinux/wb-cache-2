This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala.

25|$|A third {{reason for}} {{reservation}} is, {{in the following}} of the Easter Triduum of the Roman Catholic Church and in many Anglican churches, after {{the celebration of the}} Mass of the Lord's Supper a vigil is kept before the sacrament, placed on an Altar of Repose or similar place of reservation, until the Good Friday service at which, by tradition, there is no celebration of Mass, but the faithful receive from the reserved sacrament in the Communion part of the Celebration of the Lord's Passion. There is then no celebration until the Easter Vigil in the night leading to Easter Sunday. This pattern, revived in 1955 under Pope Pius XII, was incorporated into the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, but <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liturgy of Jerusalem, recorded by Egeria in the 4th century.|$|E

"Together Again" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional writing by Jackson's then-husband, René Elizondo, Jr. It is a dance and house track. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a key of C major. Jackson's vocals range between A3 to D5. The song has a moderate tempo of 123 beats per minute with the chord progression following the sequence of CEm7/BEm7(b5)/BbA7Dm9G13Dm9G13. The bass line in the chorus descends according to the key until reaching the supertonic, after which <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dominant note set up the resolution, the repetition of the chorus or the interlude, which begins on the submedian. At {{the end of the}} second bridge, the song modulates up a minor third into E-flat major. Three versions of the song were released; the original dance version, the [...] "Deep Remix", a R and hip-hop version, and the [...] "Deeper Remix", which is a R and soul remake. Lyrically, it was described as a ode from Jackson to a friend who had died from AIDS. Larry Flick from Billboard noted its [...] "tear-stained lyrics". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "unsullied pop bliss", saying [...] "The bass-heavy house track [...] "Together Again" [...] showcases a poignant lead vocal, giving off a '60s soul/girl group vibe", ...|$|E

2500|$|Final {{opinions}} on the album were mixed. Hope called it [...] "an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and clean cut sing-a-long choruses we've grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive." [...] Beringer praised the band's growth in musicianship {{in the years since}} From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction [...] "could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's roots, fans who dislike this album because they may think it's a cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album." [...] Heisel concluded that [...] "while This Addiction might not be perfect, it's a more than respectable entry into the band's already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio aren't done evolving yet." [...] Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary [...] "since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found." [...] Though complimenting [...] "This Addiction" [...] and [...] "Off the Map" [...] as strong songs, he felt that the album {{failed to live up to}} its expectations as a return to roots: [...] "Alkaline Trio just can't seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases [...] despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth." [...] Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the band's early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: [...] "Alkaline Trio aren't naïve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that the group can be proud of." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin remarked that the [...] "cozier confines" [...] of an independent label [...] "appear to have put the band at ease" [...] and that their [...] "hooky, blood-soaked bad-love allegories [...] satisfy like heartburn-inducing comfort food." [...] French concluded that [...] "This Addiction isn't so much a 'return to form,' but rather a summary--a sonic scrapbook of sorts that carefully documents their entire career, from sour home Chicago to the dressing rooms of Late Night with Conan O'Brien." ...|$|E
