In time reduced to the simple depiction of an aurochs head on escutcheon, it was featured alongside the arms of Wallachia and Transylvania on Michael the Brave's seal, as well as only alongside Wallachia's on various symbols favored by rulers such as Radu Mihnea and several Phanariotes (in the latter case, it was {{more often than not}} accompanied by the double-headed eagle of Byzantine tradition).|$|E
25|$|Tree {{alignment}} {{problem is}} a NP-hard problem when we restrict its scoring mode and alphabet size, {{and it can be}} found an algorithm, which uses to find the optimized solution. However, there is an exponential relationship between its efficiency and the number of sequence, it means when the number of sequence is very large, the runtime before getting results is an enormous figure and it is unacceptable. Using star alignment is faster than tree alignment to get the approximate optimized solution. However, whatever the degree of multiple-sequence similarity is, the time complexity of star alignment has a proportional relationship with the square of sequence number and the square of the sequence average length. <b>In</b> <b>usual,</b> the sequence in MSA is so long that it is also inefficient or even unacceptable. Therefore, how to reduce the time complexity to linear is one of the core issues in the Tree alignment.|$|E

2500|$|If gauge fields have gauge copies, {{these fields}} will be overcounted {{in the path}} {{integral}}. In order to counter that overcounting, Gribov argued we should limit the path integral to the first Gribov region. In order to do so, he considered the ghost propagator, which is the vacuum expectation value of the inverse of the FaddeevPopov operator. If this operator is always positive definite, the ghost propagator cannot have poles [...] which is called the [...] "no-pole condition". <b>In</b> <b>usual</b> perturbation theory (using the usual FaddeevPopov formalism), the propagator does have a pole, which means we left the first Gribov region and overcounted some configurations.|$|E

At first, Guinevere is implied as the love interest of Merlin (who is far younger in the series than <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> tales) and is also shown as having an attraction to Lancelot. However in this version of the story, Guinevere's true love is Arthur. Gwen and Arthur marry, despite Uther's and Morgana's attempts to keep them apart. Following Arthur's death, Gwen herself becomes Queen of Camelot.|$|E

2500|$|Dysthymia has {{a number}} of typical characteristics: low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low {{capacity}} for pleasure in everyday life. [...] Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. [...] In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities. [...] They will usually find little pleasure <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> activities and pastimes. Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. [...] Additionally, dysthymia often occurs {{at the same time as}} other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders. [...] There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with persons with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol and substance misuse and personality disorder.|$|E
2500|$|The terms fractal {{dimension}} and fractal were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975, {{about a decade}} after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain. Various historical authorities credit him with also synthesizing centuries of complicated theoretical mathematics and engineering work and applying them {{in a new way}} to study complex geometries that defied description <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> linear terms. The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the {{fractal dimension}} have been traced clearly back to writings about undifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that calculus was discovered in the mid-1600s. There was a lull in the published work on such functions for a time after that, then a renewal starting in the late 1800s with the publishing of mathematical functions and sets that are today called canonical fractals (such as the eponymous works of von Koch, Sierpiński, and Julia), but {{at the time of their}} formulation were often considered antithetical mathematical [...] "monsters". These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a fractal dimension through the work of Hausdorff in the early 1900s who defined a [...] "fractional" [...] dimension that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern fractals.|$|E

Kaiser Ludwig DER BAIER would appoint none of these; Anti-Kaiser Friedrich's appointments, if he made any, could be only nominal, in those distant Northern parts. Ludwig, after his victory of Muhldorf, preferred to consider the Electorate of Brandenburg as lapsed, lying vacant, ungoverned these three years; and now become the Kaiser's again. Kaiser, in consequence, gave it to his Son; whose name also is Ludwig: {{the date of the}} Investiture is 1323 (year after that victory of Muhldorf); a date unfortunate to Brandenburg. We come now into a Line of BAVARIAN Markgraves, and then of LUXEMBURG ones; both of which are of fatal significance to Brandenburg.|$|E
