During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

500|$|Many of Marlborough's hagiographers, {{following}} Lediard's panegyric, credit {{him with}} {{service in the}} North African outpost of Tangier, recently acquired {{as part of the}} dowry of Charles II's Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza. That is unlikely, and even Sir Winston S. Churchill says [...] "There is, indeed, no contemporary evidence of his ever having been there". However, Churchill then assumes that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> on the strange basis that Marlborough said that he had, at some time, been to Spain, and he supposedly would have considered the somewhat notorious and decidedly new Stuart possession of Tangier to be [...] "Spain". The known facts are that he was commissioned Ensign in September 1667, as above. On 21 February 1670, the 1st Guards, in which he had been commissioned, and the Coldstream Guards were ordered each to provide fifty musketeers, a corporal, a sergeant and a commissioned officer for service with Sir Thomas Allen's Mediterranean fleet. In March 1670, there is an order of the King to provide money owed to Churchill's father, Sir Winston, to cover John Churchill's [...] "equippage and other expenses in ye employment he is now forthwith by our command to undertake on board ye fleet in ye Mediterranean seas".|$|E

Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. I think he did that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, as if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> before.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{was sent}} to Cheltenham College in 1841 {{when he was only}} seven, but after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> a year he {{was sent to}} a school kept by the Rev. Samuel Ollis Garrard in Gloucestershire. He {{attended}} the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1848, where he was a contemporary and friend of Charles George Gordon (no relation, later 'Gordon of Khartoum') and Thomas Bland Strange (later known as [...] "Gunner Jingo"). There Gordon appears to have been good at sports, but not studious and certainly undisciplined – [...] and like Richard Henry Horne, he was asked to leave. Gordon was again admitted a pupil at Cheltenham College. He was not there for long – he appears to have left in the middle of 1852 – but the story that he was expelled from Cheltenham is without foundation. Then Gordon was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1852. Gordon began to lead a wild and aimless life, contracted debts, and was a great anxiety to his father, who at last decided that his son should go to Australia and make a fresh start in 1853 to join the mounted police with a letter of introduction to the Governor.|$|E
2500|$|Wright was {{released}} from the Maze Prison in 1980. Whilst inside he had nursed a deep resentment against the British state for having imprisoned him for being a loyalist. He was met in the car park by his aunt and girlfriend. In a final act of defiance against the authorities, Wright raised his face up towards a British Army observation tower on the Maze's perimeter fence and shouted [...] "Up the UVF". Following his release he went to Scotland where he lived for a brief period. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> only six weeks when he was taken in for questioning by the Anti-Terrorist Squad based at New Scotland Yard. Although he was not charged with any offences, Wright was nonetheless handed an exclusion order banning him from Great Britain. He soon returned to Portadown and initially tried to avoid paramilitarism. He found a job as an insurance salesman and married his girlfriend Thelma Corrigan, by whom he had two daughters, Sara and Ashleen. He took in his sister Angela's son to be raised alongside his own children when she went to live in the United States. He was regarded as a good father. In 1983 he became a born again Christian and began working as a gospel preacher in County Armagh. He had studied Christianity whilst in prison to pass the time.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{played the}} Grand Ole Opry {{for the first}} time on January 20, 1973. [...] As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to A Half Century of Hits, Lewis had always {{maintained}} ambivalent feelings towards Music City ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: [...] "It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. [...] He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different." [...] When Lewis finally took the stage, he broke just about every rule the Opry had. [...] As recounted in a 2015 online Rolling Stone article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single [...] "Another Place, Another Time" [...] and then announced to the audience, [...] "Let me tell ya something about Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and gentlemen: I am a rock and rollin', country-and-western, rhythm and blues-singin' motherfucker!" [...] Ignoring his allotted time constraints – and, thus, commercial breaks – Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight maximum minutes of stage time) and invited Del Wood – the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> as a teenager – out on stage to sing with him. [...] He also blasted through [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", [...] "Workin' Man Blues", [...] "Good Golly Miss Molly", and a host of others classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.|$|E
2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for termination of contract, at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> since day one. He added, [...] " [...] carry a lot of history. Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future we see him making a determined effort to put his family back together. Whatever happens he'll always carry a torch for Kathy". According to Holden at that time, Pete was [...] "an untouchable", not in danger of being killed-off.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards La Hermandad started feuding with La Sociedad, a superstable {{consisting}} of invaders from Los Perros del Mal {{and members of}} Los Maniacos, La Legión Extrangera and La Milicia, El Zorro and Hernandez in particular. La Hermandad received their rematch for the AAA World Tag Team Championship from Los Maniacos (Silver King and Último Gladiador) on September 19, 2010, but Lider was forced to enter the match without Nicho, who was taken out by El Zorro, Hernandez and La Legión the previous week, {{and was unable to}} regain the championship. At Héroes Inmortales IV Nicho and Lider gained a measure of revenge on Konnan by defeating him and Perros del Mal members Damián 666 and Halloween in a three–on–two handicap hardcore match. On October 30, 2010, El Zorro defeated Nicho in a Lucha de Apuesta to take his hair. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes Nicho and Líder received a shot at the AAA World Tag Team Championship, but were unable to dethrone Los Maniacos in a three–way ladder match, which also included Hernandez and El Ilegal. During the first half of 2011, La Hermandad 187 started feuding with La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador), during which the rudo trio injured Nicho, forcing him out of Triplemanía XIX on June 18. At the event Nicho tried to interfere in the match between Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal and La Maniarquía, but was stopped by AAA president Joaquín Roldan, who suspended him from AAA for his interference and had him removed the arena. Prior to the start of his three-month-long suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he would have to find work from another promotion. Nicho returned to AAA on July 16, threatening Roldan, which led to Joe Líder trying to calm his partner down. This in turn led to Nicho declaring that if Líder was with Roldan, they were no longer friends. Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder during a Monster's Ball match and put him through a flaming table, costing him the match in the process. On August 19, 2011, Nicho attacked Líder again before putting on a Perros del Mal T-shirt, which led to the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo officially welcoming him to the group, turning rudo in the process. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry, when Nicho, Damián 666 and Halloween were defeated in a Mask vs. Hair steel cage match, following interference from Joe Líder, and were all shaved bald.|$|E
2500|$|At Triplemanía XIX, Nicho el Millonario {{interfered}} in a six-man tag team match, {{where his}} tag team partner Joe Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal faced Los Maniacos and was, as a result, suspended {{for three months}} by AAA following the event in accordance to a deal made between Konnan and Joaquín Roldán. Prior {{to the start of}} his suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he would have to find work from another promotion.

This in turn led to Nicho declaring that if Líder was with Roldan, they were no longer friends. Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. After another attack at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder for the third time on August 19, before putting on a Perros del Mal shirt, which led to El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, making his first AAA appearance in two months, officially welcoming him to the group. On September 16, Konnan rewarded Chessman by moving him back to La Legión Extrangera and naming him the group's new general, taking over the spot formerly held by El Zorro. In the process, Decnnis was also moved from La Milicia to Los Maniacos. Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario were defeated in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match and were all shaved bald. At the same event, Abyss and Chessman defeated Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to bring the AAA World Tag Team Championship back to La Sociedad, while El Hijo del Perro Aguayo failed to capture the AAA Latin American Championship from Dr. Wagner Jr. After the match between Wagner and Aguayo, Octagón shocked AAA by turning on the promotion and attacking Wagner. La Parka then entered the ring to seemingly confront his longtime partner, before also turning on Wagner and attacking him along with Octagón, Aguayo, Konan Big and Silver King. On November 5, Konnan named Octagón the new leader of La Milicia, replacing Super Fly. Octagón then showed that he had not forgotten what Super Fly had done to him fourteen months earlier by ordering {{the rest of the group}} to attack him, kicking him out of La Milicia. At the November 14 tapings, Héctor Garza jumped from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to AAA, aligning himself with Los Perros del Mal. On December 16 at Guerra de Titanes, L.A. Park defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship. Following the match, a new group named El Consejo ("The Council"), consisting of former CMLL workers El Texano Jr., Toscano and Máscara Año 2000 Jr., made its debut, declaring war on both AAA and La Sociedad. On March 11, 2012, La Sociedads title domination ended, when Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Psycho Circus. The following day, the three announced that they had quit Los Perros del Mal. On March 18 at Rey de Reyes, the short-lived alliance between La Sociedad and La Parka came to an end, when Octagón and La Milicia turned on him, after he had lost his rivalry against Los Bizarros. Rey de Reyes also continued the rivalry between La Sociedad stablemates, Jeff Jarrett and L.A. Park. After Jarrett's interference caused Park to get eliminated from the Rey de Reyes tournament, Park came back during the main event and cost Jarrett the AAA Mega Championship in his match against El Mesías. On August 5 at Triplemanía XX, Jarrett and the debuting Kurt Angle represented Dorian Roldán in a match, where they faced Park and Electroshock, representing Joaquín Roldán, with the Roldáns' hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, but Joaquín announced that he did not want his son shaved after he had agreed to disband La Sociedad. However, Dorian ended up once again betraying his father by attaking him and shaving him instead. The event also featured Psicosis defeating longtime rival Joe Líder in another Hair vs. Hair match and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo unsuccessfully challenging El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The following November, El Consejo joined La Sociedad. On December 2 at Guerra de Titanes, El Consejo member El Texano Jr. defeated El Mesías to bring the AAA Mega Championship back to La Sociedad.|$|E
