5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

25|$|James Small further {{advanced}} the design. Using mathematical methods he experimented with various designs until {{he arrived at}} a shape cast from {{a single piece of}} iron, an improvement on the Scots plough of James Anderson of Hermiston. A single-piece cast iron plough was also developed and patented by Charles Newbold in the United States. This was again improved on by Jethro Wood, a blacksmith of Scipio, New York, who made a three-part Scots Plough that allowed a broken piece to be replaced. In 1837 John Deere introduced the first steel plough; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> stronger than iron designs that it could work soil in areas of the US that had previously been considered unsuitable for farming.|$|E

So water gets up into the air, and I wonder how it can, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> heavier. <b>So</b> that the {{difficulty}} {{is just about the}} same." ...|$|R

25|$|Euclid (c. 325-265 BC), of Alexandria, {{probably}} {{a student at}} the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled The Elements of Geometry, in which he presented geometry in an ideal axiomatic form, which {{came to be known as}} Euclidean geometry. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the Hellenistic mathematicians knew at the time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid’s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by Ptolemy I, King of Egypt.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} second-generation {{battleship}} in the US Navy, Nevada {{has been described}} as [...] "revolutionary" [...] and [...] "as radical as [...] was in her day" [...] by present-day historians. At the time of its completion in 1916, The New York Times remarked that the new warship was [...] "the greatest [...] afloat" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> larger than other contemporary American battleships: its tonnage was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre-dreadnought , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship , and almost [...] greater than that of one of the first American dreadnoughts, —built just seven years prior to Nevada.|$|E
500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But to me <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we {{on the front line}} were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
500|$|McCready {{said that}} a lot of the songs were {{developed}} out of jam sessions, and said [...] "I think we kind of rushed it a little bit." [...] Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals. He added that [...] "Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of No Code, he was so burnt, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> work for him." [...] The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that [...] "everybody was on their best musical behavior around him." [...] McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him [...] "a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O'Brien said, [...] "It was really a transitional record. We had a good time making it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "More serious, certainly," [...] {{returned}} Colonel Geraldine; [...] "and as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>so,</b> {{will you}} allow me five minutes' speech in private {{with my friend}} Mr. Godall?" ...|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Britain had {{no choice}} but to accept the deal, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more {{advantageous}} to America than Britain that Churchill's aide John Colville compared it to the USSR's relationship with Finland. The destroyers were in reserve from the massive U.S. World War I shipbuilding program, and many of the vessels required extensive overhaul due to the fact that many were not preserved properly when inactivated; one British admiral called them the [...] "worst destroyers I had ever seen", and only 30 were in service by May 1941. Churchill also disliked the deal, but his advisers persuaded the prime minister to merely tell Roosevelt that: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{he wrote}} [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both of Us", Ron could only play {{it in that}} key. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> work to {{transpose}} the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a [...] "rock" [...] voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about [...] "guts". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{my nature}} to be earnest. A girl comes {{out into the}} world so young that she becomes serious, and steady as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sooner than a man does." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see what everybody else was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Oliver {{was also}} an {{acclaimed}} artist with his work being displayed in exhibitions depicting Rhondda life. There are slight variations with the cover in different territories with some showing {{the shadow of the}} figure with wings - either angels wings or more likely bird wings. This is best depicted in an official promotional colour wallpaper the band released for fans. Whilst it has never been clarified, the city in the background is believed to depict Los Angeles in the United States where the album was recorded and mixed. Ian Watkins said that he regarded artwork as [...] "just as important as the music", and in January 2010 reflected back on some of the Lostprophets' artwork saying [...] "I remember doing the ‘Start Something’ record and compiling the inlay which is a collage of two years of our lives. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. I’d sit there for hours looking at the booklet and all the little pictures. I did that to all the albums I bought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{found the}} film too {{derivative}} of previous Star Wars films. Andrew O'Hehir wrote for Salon {{that it was}} [...] "the work of a talented mimic or ventriloquist who can just about cover {{for the fact that}} he has nothing much to say". Stephanie Zacharek of TIME wrote that Abrams had delivered [...] "everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted". Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film's [...] "top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope", but felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> [...] "an exercise in fan service [...] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture". Brian Merchant of Motherboard wrote that [...] "Science fiction is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod … one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot." ...|$|E
60|$|I am by {{no means}} sure that if the good people of Milby had known {{the truth about the}} Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been {{considerably}} disappointed to find that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very far from being as bad as they imagined.

2500|$|On June 7, 2011, both [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] leaked online, {{followed}} by the whole album, three weeks prior to its official release date on June 28, 2011. This was {{followed by}} cease-and-desist notices from Beyoncé's legal team, who forced multiple media sites to remove download links to the songs. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote. On June 24, 2011, [...] "Countdown" [...] was the ninth song to be chosen. The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on the song's inspiration: [...] "I really liked mixing the 90s with the 70s. I put those two together and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun putting bridges back into songs, all the things in music that I love that I feel I just want to hear again." [...] She also referred to [...] "Countdown" [...] as [...] "really experimental". Concerning the development [...] "Countdown" [...] {{and the reason for}} using the sample, Beyoncé stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
