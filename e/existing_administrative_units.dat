The debate began in 1832, when Mouzinho de Sousa's administration oversaw implementation {{of a system of}} appointing regional administrators to govern the municipalities, thus imposing central government programs and ideology on them: it was accused of being Napoleonic in its organization. The issue of centralization or de-centralization was an ongoing debate in the post-War era, resulting in successive legislation veering one way or the other.. The government of Manuel Passos finally extinguished 466 municipalities in 1836, as many of them could not provide functional government. This lasted only six years, then in 1842, Costa Cabral's regime instituted another program of centralization, which was quickly challenged by the legislative acts of Almeida Garrett, Anselmo Braamcamp, Martins Ferrão, and Dias Ferreira. An economic revitalization in 1878 finally resulted in a new program of decentralization by Rodrigues Sampaio, which included exaggerated local responsibilities and the legal means for localities to raise taxes. By 1886 there was a new centralizing tendency. Consequently, over time (even extending into the Republican era) local authorities began to be supported by subsidy and co-financed projects.|$|E

During this time, the constitution making process was in progress. The Constitutional Assembly was close to assent the draft of the Constitution when the Governor General and the leader of One Unit supporters Ghulam Mohammad Khan dissolved the Assembly on 24 October 1954. The hidden cause of this quick action was that the proposed draft was not supportive to the One Unit Scheme. After dissolution of the first Constitutional Assembly, second Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was elected. Its first meeting was held in July 1955. The first task of the new Assembly was to pass the One Unit bill. The bill was moved by Sardar Amir Azam Khan. The discussion on bill started on 23 August 1955.

40|$|Democracy, {{which means}} {{the rule of the}} people, has evolved by means of {{different}} applications in different societies throughout history up to the present day. Societies have lived democracy variously according to their socio-economic, political and judicial structures. Democracy has been evaluated differently from a variety of viewpoints since the time of the ancient Greeks and has gained respectability only in the twentieth century. Having achieved a supreme position as a way of governance today, democracy represents the political regime where human rights are fully recognized. The basic principles of democracy, which are liberty, equality, political representation and the recognition of rights, manifest the fact that democracy cannot be reduced to the mere existence of procedures or institutions. The concept of democracy cannot be grasped correctly if evaluation is made only by taking into account the elements that take place in realist democracy theories, i. e., by looking at the minimum procedural requirements that may be common qualities of some already <b>existing</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> designated as democratic. Even a moderately successful democracy should involve many other qualities than the existence of these procedural conditions. The pioneers of the modern democracy theories that emerged before the twentiety century are the classical democracy theories that have been discussed until the present day. When analyzed {{from the perspective of a}} more advanced democracy idea, it is easy to observe that these theories have some limitations specific to them. While the current democracy theories reveal the shortcomings of the previous ones, a comparative study reflects the failures and strengths of the said theories. The general assumption over the concept of democracy which enjoys wide acceptance and is often disputed at political, academic or social platforms today is t to solve problem. Whereas, if conceived with all its aspects, democracy can also be responsible for the creation of various problems...|$|E

40|$|RELEVANCE OF DEMOGRAPHIC CRITERION AT ESTABLISHING STATISTIC REGIONS IN CONTEXT PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION Within {{the process}} of {{defining}} statistic regionalization in the countries being candidates and the potential candidates, a demographic criterion is pointed out as the key one. It is a reason why we, in this work, concentrate on the criterion of demographic size while determining statistic (NUTS) regions in the European Union {{within the context of}} implementation of the Regulation on the establishing common classification of territorial units for the statistics. Regulation (EC) No 1059 / 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council from May 26 th, 2003 related to the establishment of common classification of territorial units for statistics. Within the work, we verify the hypothesis: that there is significant deviation from the criterion of demographic size at statistic (NUTS) regions in European Union. We verify the hypothesis by applying relevant statistic methods. Data basis for testing hypothesis is overtaken from the relevant tables of the Eurostat official website [URL] Testing was performed in two steps. In the first step, 317 statistic regions of the second level (NUTS II) were analyzed. The second step analyzed 1, 327 statistic regions of the third level (NUTS III). Both steps specifically analyzed deviation from minimal and maximal demographic size of statistic region belonging to corresponding level. The results are presented in tables and graphs. Actuality of research is determined by the Bosnia and Herzegovina obligation to define statistic regions (NUTS regions) so as by {{the fact that in the}} Bosnia and Herzegovina case non critical application of this criterion as the eliminatory one, may be in the conflict with the first criterion, or, <b>existing</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> and other criterions being relevant for the formation of regional structure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the process of}} introduction of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) in Croatia. It will be discussed about all criteria that should be applied during that process of establishment and about constraints that disable reaching optimal solution. First constraint was the EUROSTAT?s recommendation that {{the establishment of the}} Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics should be based on the existing administrative division of the state territory. According to the main criteria (population size) the entire territory of the Republic of Croatia represents NUTS level I, existing counties NUTS level III, and the <b>existing</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> as municipalities and cities fulfil criteria of the establishment of NUTS IV level regions. As there are no administrative territorial units that correspond to NUTS level II, which is the main framework for the implementation of regional policy and the one competent for the analysis of regional problems and analyses, the most suitable solution is the formation of this level by combining counties. The biggest problem is how to define the NUTS II level. 1. Aggravating circumstance is {{the fact that in the}} Republic of Croatia a longer-lasting division in real regional units has never been established, which could serve as the basis for regional development policy. By this fact alone, the division of the territory of the Republic of Croatia in second level statistical units brings with it also a sensitive issue of regionalisation of Croatia and leads to political debates. To this contribute also the fact that the existing monitoring of statistical data on lower levels is not satisfactory, and the problem of data as the basis for quality economic analysis appeared. 2. In Croatia there are neither set regional boundaries nor a clearly defined regional policy. By introducing NUTS it would be possible to establish regional statistics as a basis for the formulation of regional policy. In the remainder the paper discusses main criteria which should be considered during the process of establishment regions as subject of regional policy. It presents how regionalisation depends on the criteria used and how different profession use different criteria. At the end, the final proposal of the Decision on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics will be presented. Key words: regional policy, regionalisation...|$|E
