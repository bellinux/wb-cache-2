25|$|Gleeson {{grew up in}} Warrnambool, Victoria as {{a member}} of a sports-mad family, with four older {{siblings}} who were all good in their chosen sports of football, basketball and swimming. As a child, Gleeson would sneak as close as he could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and {{most parts of the}} frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones {{was not part of the}} normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E
500|$|The {{site was}} first rediscovered by {{accident}} in 1898 when Archibald Hamilton was riding across Withypool Heath. His horse stumbled {{against one of}} the stones, and on further investigation he located other stones within the bracken. After the bracken on the heath was burned away, something that took place periodically to encourage new growth, Hamilton returned to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the circle. He contacted Colonel Bramble, the Vice President of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, who put him in touch with the archaeologist Harold St George Gray. Gray then accompanied Hamilton on a visit to the site in August 1905, at which point he made a survey of the ring.|$|E
50|$|With {{the final}} design in place, Preston Tucker took the {{pre-production}} {{cars on the}} road to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds gathering wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the car.|$|R
50|$|After their deaths, Boom {{visits a}} temple and finds {{that if she}} donates coffins for the spirits, they will not bother her. She makes some offerings. While leaving the temple, she sees the ghosts of her victims {{in the back of}} a car and steps off of the {{sidewalk}} to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look,</b> whereupon she is hit by a car. The accident causes her to lose her baby.|$|R
50|$|During {{the battle}} of Moscow, Dovator was the {{commander}} of 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps, which fended off the enemy advance at Volokolamsk. He was killed in action on 19 December 1941 near the outskirts of Ruza. He was reportedly cut down by machine-gun fire while crawling towards a forward position to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look.</b> Dovator was posthumously given the title Hero of the Soviet Union two days afterwards, {{as well as the}} Order of Lenin. He was replaced in command by Major General Issa Pliyev.|$|R
2500|$|As more {{governors}} and delegates arrived, crowds of local onlookers and politicians began to gather {{on the train}} platform beside the hotel to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the dignified guests. [...] Even General John Alexander McClernand and staff, who were passing through Altoona, decided to observe the spectacle. [...] Also in attendance was a reporter from the New York Herald. (The article about the conference appeared {{on the front page}} of this periodical on September 29, 1862.) [...] The day before the meeting was to begin, the governors who had arrived so far took a sight-seeing trip to the famous Horseshoe Curve, compliments of John Edgar Thomson and the Pennsylvania Railroad.|$|E
2500|$|While on an {{airplane}} once, Dean saw an advertisement in a magazine for a liquor company featuring a beautiful woman standing in water in a provocative pose holding a drink {{similar to the way}} Playboy posed models. [...] This led to an idea that changed the way guitars were marketed. Dean created his own ads that caused a wave of controversy. [...] Guitar ads for Dean’s company were featuring bikini-clad models wearing guitars. [...] His early music magazine print ads and trade show marketing used female models from Playboy, and [...] it was this marketing that filled NAMM Show (National Association of Music Merchants) event aisles with merchants seeking to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the guitars (and models) that were quickly becoming the talk of the industry. [...] When Dean was warned by the trade show officials at one show that he had better tone it down in order to help keep the aisles clear, he knew he was on to something.|$|E

50|$|In January 1963, Bartlett and his {{graduate}} student, P. R. Rao, were hospitalized after {{an explosion in}} the laboratory. As they looked at what they thought might be the first crystals of XeF2, the compound exploded, getting shards of glass in the eyes of both men. According to Bartlett, he thought that the compound may have contained water molecules, and he and Rao took off their glasses to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look.</b> They were both taken to the hospital for four weeks, and Bartlett was left blind in one eye. The last piece of glass from this accident was removed 27 years later.|$|R
5000|$|These statuettes, which {{generally}} do not exceed 15cm in height, began to be sold in Santiago in the early 1990s and quickly became popular. The municipal market of Temuco sold large quantities of this figure for their identity with the Mapuche people; in this market you can find carved figures that exceed 1.50 meters in height. The humor of the statue lies partly {{in the fact that}} what at first appears to be the craftwork of pre-Columbian indigenous people, carved by hand, when lifted (to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> of the work) [...] "surprises" [...] the viewer by revealing the statue's genitalia - and the reason for the Indian's mischievous smile.|$|R
50|$|Youngest sister Adela, {{stricken}} with sudden spirit and jubilation after her father's funeral, defies her mother's orders and dons a green dress instead of remaining in mourning black. Her brief taste of youthful joy suddenly shatters when she discovers that Angustias will be marrying Pepe. Poncia, Bernarda's maid, advises Adela to bide her time: Angustias will probably die delivering her first child. Distressed, Adela threatens {{to run into}} the streets in her green dress, but her sisters manage to stop her. Suddenly they see Pepe coming down the street. She stays behind while her sisters rush to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> look, until a maid hints that she could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> from her bedroom window.|$|R

60|$|The {{boys had}} been to work about an hour when Sam saw a young fellow limping around {{the other end of}} the deck. There was {{something}} strangely familiar about the party, and the youngest Rover drew closer to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
5000|$|When Qwill peers {{through the}} same {{peephole}} the houseboy had used, he sees Dan copying things out of <b>a</b> ledger. To <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look,</b> Qwilleran claims Fluxion wants a photo shoot of Dan's pottery, and brings Koko along to pose in some pictures (though he really wants the cat to sniff around for clues). Koko does show great interest in the trap door to the basement, but Dan says that they shouldn’t go down there because there are rats. But Qwill later learns that Maus is very particular about sanitation, and has an exterminator in regularly. Also, Qwilleran finds the ledger Dan was copying out of, and discovers it was a recipe of glazes used by Joy.|$|R
40|$|Dust and gas play {{important}} roles {{in the formation of}} celestial bodies. In order to study more about the dust in space, we do experiments to study the dust samples that might have similar characteristics as those in space. We have been developing methods to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> close look of dust. Such methods includes using of SEM to observe the basic physical characteristic of the dust, creating program assisting image analyzing, optimizing the display of the dust by trying different ways to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> even distribution of dust, etc. Some convenient ways for analysis have been developed.

60|$|Larry was {{interested}} in watching the sharpshooters and range-finders in the tops, and he walked across the deck to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. Luke followed, and as he did so, one of the nearest of the Russian ships sent out a roaring broadside at the Shohirika which raked her fore and aft and sent another hole through her side, but this time above the water line where it did scant damage.|$|E
60|$|Then the fox really {{begins his}} performance. He jumps high to snap at {{imaginary}} flies; he chases his bushy tail; he rolls {{over and over}} in clouds of flying sand; he gallops up the shore, and back like a whirlwind; he plays peekaboo with every bush. The foolish birds grow excited; they swim in smaller circles, quacking nervously, drawing nearer and nearer to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the strange performance. They are long in coming, but curiosity always gets the better of them; those in the rear crowd the front rank forward. All the while the show goes on, the performer paying not the slightest attention apparently to his excited audience; only he draws slowly back from the water's edge, as if to give them room as they crowd nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is an uncommonly pretty trading schooner, Bertha," [...] Frank Mallett said, as he {{rose from}} his chair to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a craft that was passing along to the eastward. [...] "I suppose she {{must be in the}} fruit trade, and must just have arrived from the Levant. I should not be {{surprised}} if she had been a yacht at one time. She is not carrying much sail, but she is going along fast. I think they would have done better if they had rigged her as a fore-and-aft schooner instead of putting those heavy yards on the foremast. That broad band of white round her spoils her appearance; her jib boom is unusually long, and she must carry a tremendous spread of canvas in light winds. I should think that she must be full up to the hatches, for she is very low in the water for a trader." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 April 1731, Needham {{was convicted}} of keeping a disorderly house, fined one shilling, and sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, and [...] "to find sureties for her good {{behaviour}} for 3 years". On 30 April she {{was taken to the}} pillory near Park Place to stand for the first time. Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face {{down in front of the}} pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her. Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed. The crowds that had gathered to see her pilloried were so large that one boy fell on an iron fencing rail while trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> and was killed.|$|R
5000|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle {{said the}} {{direction}} of The Last Sin Eater, [...] "The camera {{always seems to be}} too far off when you wish to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> and too close when you wish that it would point at anything other than what’s in the frame." [...] However, Betty Joe Tucker of Reel Talk was impressed by the cinematography, saying, [...] "This extremely well-photographed film establishes a compelling 'you are there' atmosphere. It also boasts impressive performances by children and adult actors alike. Liana Liberato, who plays Cadi, is a real find. Because of the intensity and vulnerability she projects." [...] Additionally, Variety complimented the look of the film: [...] "Pic was attractively lensed by Robert Seaman in Utah locales that adequately double for Appalachian mountain country." ...|$|R
5000|$|Acme Fur Company, as expected, goes up in flames. On {{their way}} there, Fletcher and Grayson pass {{a car and}} Fletcher orders his driver to [...] "cut across that car". Inside is the same woman Fletcher met at the Excelsior fire. She {{explains}} {{that she was not}} running away from the fire, but simply going to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look.</b> <b>Getting</b> into Fletcher and Grayson's car, she rides with them to the fire. Upon arriving, Fletcher leaves to investigate, while the woman introduces herself to Grayson as Adrienne Martin. Fletcher asks his man Tony, the organ grinder with a monkey (unbilled Monte Carter) who walks over to identify the man seen leaving the building. Questioned by Fletcher, the man identifies himself as Mr. Crane (unbilled Barlowe Borland), the owner. Meanwhile, upon being repeatedly asked by Adrienne about Fletcher, Grayson tells her that [...] "when the honorable Tommy passes into the great beyond, half the girls in town will be out shopping for mourning outfits".|$|R
6000|$|There was no error. There was {{the little}} white speck, and he {{levelled}} the glass to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. An exclamation now clearly broke from his lips, and {{for a minute or}} two the young man actually appeared to be out of his senses. [...] "The pinnace," [...] "the Neshamony," [...] however, were words that escaped him, and, had there been a witness, might have given an insight into this extraordinary conduct. Mark had, in fact, ascertained that the sail beneath the peak was no other than the little craft that had been swept away, as already described, with Betts in it. Fourteen months had elapsed since that occurrence, and here it was again, seemingly endeavouring to return to the place where it had been launched! Mark adopted perhaps the best expedient in his power to attract attention to himself, and to let his presence be known. He fired both barrels of his fowling-piece, and repeated the discharges several times, or until a flag was shown on board the sloop, which was now just beneath the cliff, a certain sign that he had succeeded. A musket was also fired from the vessel.|$|E
60|$|The river, as the {{well-known}} {{arm of the}} sea in which the Swash was lying is erroneously termed, was just at that moment unusually clear of craft, and not a sail, larger {{than that of a}} boat, was to be seen between the end of Blackwell's Island and Corlaer's Hook, a distance of about a league. This stagnation in the movement of the port, at that particular point, was owing to the state of wind and tide. Of the first, there {{was little more than a}} southerly air, while the last was about two-thirds ebb. Nearly everything that was expected on that tide, coast-wise, and by the way of the Sound, had already arrived, and nothing could go eastward, with that light breeze and under canvas, until the flood made. Of course it was different with the steamers, who were paddling about like so many ducks, steering in all directions, though mostly crossing and re-crossing at the ferries. Just as Mulford turned away from his commander, however, a large vessel of that class shoved her bows into the view, doubling the Hook, and going eastward. The first glance at this vessel sufficed to drive even Rose Budd momentarily out of the minds of both master and mate, and to give a new current to their thoughts. Spike had been on the point of walking up the wharf, but he now so far changed his purpose as actually to jump on board of the brig and spring up alongside of his mate, on the taffrail, in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the steamer. Mulford, who loathed so much in his commander, was actually glad of this, Spike's rare merit as a seaman forming a sort of attraction that held him, as it might be against his own will, bound to his service.|$|E

50|$|The {{troops were}} {{beginning}} to leave as the council ended when Colonel Sumner arrived at Fort Atkinson {{on his way to}} New Mexico. He stayed for a few days to trade and obtain some horses from the tribes in attendance. After some time, the tribes began to freely explore both the fort and his camp, and Fitzpatrick grew nervous at the opportunities for conflict. Lean Bear, who was in attendance at the peace council, was fascinated by the rings and bracelets on the hand of Sumner's wife and grabbed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look.</b> She reacted by pulling her hand back and screaming, provoking Sumner to rush forward to beat Lean Bear. Because Cheyenne culture considers striking even a male child to be an insult, Lean Bear was incredibly indignant about the assault. He painted his face and rode around his camp announcing his plans to attack the whites, inviting his brothers to join him. Fitzpatrick initially refused to make reparations until some Kiowas and Comanches told him that the Cheyennes were getting ready to attack. A meeting was later arranged for Colonel Sumner to present Lean Bear with a blanket in apology, which he accepted.|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} Rockwell {{coming home to}} {{discover}} that the wrong newspaper has been delivered to his doorstep. As he takes a quick shower, he begins to have strange visions (in a manner recalling The Dead Zone) of himself being pursued around his house by assorted ghoulish appartions, of the looming figure of a cadaverous-looking man, and of finding a tombstone engraved with his own name. His shower is interrupted when he hears something outside and goes out on his balcony to investigate. He is shocked to see the man from his visions standing at his gate, but as he struggles to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> in spite of the sun in his face he is greatly relieved to see that he is merely a mailman, come to deliver the correct newspaper. As the mailman walks up the path towards the front porch, however, a brief close-up of his arm reveals that he is, in fact, a zombie. Rockwell emerges onto the porch to receive the paper, which the mailman genially hands over. As the mailman brings his other arm around to strike, Rockwell has just enough time to notice that he is not human.|$|R

The brig must have been about a day's run to the southward of Bermuda. It was my watch below, but having just breakfasted, I was on deck, and looking about me carelessly, I was struck {{with the appearance of}} the vessel's being deeper than common. I had a little conversation about it, with a man in the forechains, who thought the same thing. This man leaned over, in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look,</b> when he called out that he could see that we had started a butt! I went over, immediately, and got a look at this serious injury. A butt had started, sure enough, just under the chains, but so low down as to be quite out of our reach. The plank had started quite an inch, and it was loosened as much as two feet, forward and aft. We sounded the pumps, as soon as possible, and found the brig was half full of water! ...|$|R

60|$|From this time, nothing {{worthy of}} being noted occurred, until we reached the coast. We had got {{as high as the}} capes of Virginia, and were running in for the land, with a fair wind, when we made a ship in-shore of us. The {{stranger}} hauled up to speak us, as soon as we were seen. There was a good deal of discussion about this vessel, as she drew near, between Captain Digges and his chief-mate. The latter said he knew the vessel, and that it was an Indiaman out of Philadelphia, called the Ganges, a sort of sister craft to our own ship; while the former maintained, if it were the Ganges at all, she was so altered as scarcely to be recognised. As we got near, the stranger threw a shot under our fore-foot, and showed an American pennant and ensign. <b>Getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at her, we got so many signs of a vessel-of-war in our neighbour, as to think it wisest to heave-to, when the other vessel passed under our stern, tacked, and lay with her head-yards aback, a little on our weather-quarter. As she drew to windward, we saw her stern, which had certain national emblems, but no name on it. This settled the matter. She was a man-of-war, and she carried the American flag! Such a thing did not exist a few months before, when we left home, and Captain Digges was burning with impatience to know more. He was soon gratified.|$|R
