5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant {{he was unable to}} join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> tracking sessions.|$|E

Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Basic</b> Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's American Buffalo, for which Pacino {{was nominated for a}} Drama Desk Award. Since 1990, Pacino's stage work has included revivals of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie, Oscar Wilde's Salome and in 2005 Lyle Kessler's Orphans.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Model {{was posted}} to the 3rd Infantry Division, an elite {{formation}} of the Reichswehr and one that was heavily involved in testing the technical innovations of that era. From 1928, he lectured in tactics and war studies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> General Staff training course, and in 1930 he {{was transferred to the}} Training Branch of the Truppenamt. He became known both for his enthusiastic support of military modernisation and for his complete lack of tact. In 1938, the year he became a major general (Generalmajor), he led a testfiring of the Mörser 18 on mocked-up Czech fortifications, which did not impress Hitler. As were many army officers at the time, Model was a supporter of the National Socialist government; his time in Berlin also brought him into contact with senior members of the Nazi regime. Closer relationships with Goebbels and Speer developed during the war.|$|E

25|$|From a Maslownian perspective, Sarkar {{defends the}} need to meet {{physical}} and mental needs before being able {{to engage in a}} journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.

Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.|$|E
