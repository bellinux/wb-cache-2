5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive" [...] is a downtempo ballad {{recorded}} by American singer Jennifer Lopez. It {{was written by}} Lopez, Cris Judd, and Cory Rooney for the Michael Apted-directed thriller, Enough (2002). Lopez stars in the film as Slim, a waitress who marries a wealthy contractor, and flees with their young daughter as he becomes increasingly abusive. While on the run, Slim, who discovers that her husband is following her, [...] "trains herself for a final, violent confrontation". The producers of Enough wanted her to write a new song for film, however, Lopez <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{was not something that}} could be forced. In October 2001, while on their honeymoon, Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful", {{and that it would be}} perfect fit for Enough. She incorporated the hardships that Slim went through in the film, as well as her own personal struggles, into the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Land {{is remembered}} for its {{miniaturized}} Super Mario elements and [...] "twist {{on just about}} every Mario mainstay imaginable". Many of its new elements did not recur later in the series, making Super Mario Land strange compared {{to the rest of}} the series, or what IGN's Thomas described as a [...] "singular oddball". IGN's Marc Nix felt retrospectively that Super Mario Land was the only uninspired Mario game, with [...] "funky voids of white" [...] and UFOs instead of the [...] "strikingly original" [...] Mushroom Kingdom. Mean Machines was also put off by the alien theme, easy difficulty, and dot matrix screen blur. IGN's Travis Fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as [...] "ambitious" [...] as Super Mario Bros. 3. Mean Machines <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was not [...] "a true Mario game", not worth its originally high review score, and [...] "in retrospect, not really a classic".|$|E
500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics compared Rymdkapsel gameplay to Tetris and SimCity. Of its visual style, The New York Times published {{that the game}} makes others in the real-time strategy genre [...] "feel needlessly garnished". Reviewers generally appreciated the game's simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start. IGN's Steve Watts thought that the game made too many [...] "design concessions" [...] to its minimalism, though he considered the style [...] "gorgeous", and {{felt that he was}} never fully in control of his base. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell said that the game's minimalism extended to its core gameplay, where the player should strive to [...] "play the game less and less". Joseph Leray of TouchArcade described the game's balance and pacing as [...] "impeccable". He gave Rymdkapsel a perfect score and wrote that it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were custom-made for iOS. Bryan Vore of Game Informer criticized the game's lack of features and thought that it [...] "fizzled out with no fanfare" [...] as a [...] "creative" [...] idea but without sufficient [...] "polish". The Verges Trent Wolbe called the soundtrack [...] "a minimalist achievement". Jonasson announced that the game had sold 200,000 copies as of December 2, 2013, {{due in large part to}} its inclusion in a Humble Bundle sale.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{opens with}} an intertitle that {{features}} a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for On the 6, artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, [...] "Why Risk a Music Career?", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, {{about the risks of}} starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was simply the [...] "next natural step" [...] in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the [...] "ultimate" [...] triple threat – [...] "the actor, singer and dancer". Lopez then confers, in the chapter [...] "Press Tours / Promotions", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more [...] "personal" [...] as it is something that is [...] "closer to your heart" [...] and something she [...] "really believes in". According to Lopez, {{by the end of the}} promotional tour for the album she [...] "lost" [...] her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode was a {{pleasant}} way {{to return to the}} series, and was glad the harvest festival would give the characters something specific to focus on. However, Fowler felt {{there was a lack of}} closure over Tom's resentment in the episode of Ron dating Wendy. Joel Keller of TV Squad felt the new Chris and Ben characters served as a strong springboard into the third season, and that the premiere episode lived up to the anticipation caused by the show's long hiatus. However, Keller said Tom's continued pining for Wendy felt [...] "a little protracted at this point". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the episode and said the parks department employees taking drastic steps to save their department reflected Parks efforts to seek out higher ratings. Kandell, however, felt introducing Chris' tragic back story in the episode felt rushed. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic called the episode consistently funny, and said the new characters Ben and Chris were starting to hit their stride. However, Hochberger said Eduardo subplot felt like a contrived device to continue keeping April and Andy apart. Not all reviews were entirely positive. David Hinckley of New York Daily News called Parks and Recreation [...] "a good show that could be a better show", claiming it falls short of other NBC comedies like 30 Rock. Hinckley cited the basketball game with Andy, Ron and Tom as a scene that feels too much like a sketch comedy bit rather than a natural progression of the script. Nick Purdy of Paste said the addition of new cast members Chris and Ben may have diluted the rest of the cast's talents, and that the episode <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had [...] "too many plates spinning", leaving not enough screentime for strong characters like April Ludgate and Ron Swanson.|$|E

2500|$|Though A Feast for [...] Crows was {{the first}} novel in the {{sequence}} to debut at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, it received more negative reviews {{in comparison with the}} previous novels in the series. [...] Martin's decision to halve the plot in terms of character and location was highly controversial; many critics felt that this novel consisted of characters that people were less interested in. [...] Publishers Weekly said, [...] "Long-awaited doesn't begin to describe this fourth installment in bestseller Martin's staggeringly epic Song of Ice and Fire[...] This is not Act I Scene 4 but Act II Scene 1, laying groundwork more than advancing the plot, and it sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard said in 2011, [...] "I don't care how good a writer you are: If you subtract your three strongest characters from your tale, you severely undermine the basis for why readers fell under your spell in the first place. It didn't work. But there was also a sense in A Feast of Crows that Martin had lost his way. The characters whose stories he did tell wandered back and forth across a landscape devastated by war and oncoming winter, but didn't seem to be headed anywhere in particular." [...] Remy Verhoeve of The Huffington Post noted in their 2011 A Dance with Dragons review that the fifth volume had to [...] "repair some of the damage done by A Feast for Crows, which frankly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was written by a ghost writer at times." [...] Both books had [...] "the same structural problems", being [...] "sprawling and incoherent", and in her opinion Feast has the less interesting characters. The Atlantic Rachael Brown said in their A Dance With Dragons review that Feast was [...] "bleak and plodding" [...] and [...] "sorely missed" [...] Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow.|$|E

There were his most prized and used books, covered with marks and written notes; there was Laura's drawing of Sintram, which had lived with him in his rooms at Oxford; there was a roll of music, and there was his desk. The first thing when she opened it was a rough piece of spar, wrapped in paper, on which was written, 'M. A. D., Sept. 18.' She remembered what he had told her of little Marianne's gift.

For the four roads that meet in the market-place of my little town make {{one of the largest}} and {{simplest}} of such outlines on the map of England; and the shape as it shines on that wooded chart always affects me in a singular fashion. The sight of the cross-roads is in a true sense the sign of the cross. For it is the sign of a truly Christian thing; that sharp combination of liberty and limitation which we call choice. A man is entirely free to choose between right and left, or between right and wrong. As I looked for the last time at the pale roads under the load of cloud, I knew that our civilisation had indeed come to the cross-roads. As the paths grew fainter, fading under the gathering shadow, I <b>felt</b> rather <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had lost its way in a forest.|$|R
60|$|Mr Pecksniff had no {{objection}} to music; not the least. He was tolerant of everything; he often said so. He considered it a vagabond kind of trifling, in general, just suited to Tom's capacity. But in regard to Tom's performance upon this same organ, he was remarkably lenient, singularly amiable; for when Tom played it on Sundays, Mr Pecksniff in his unbounded sympathy <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he played <b>it</b> himself, and were a benefactor to the congregation. So whenever {{it was impossible to}} devise any other means of taking the value of Tom's wages out of him, Mr Pecksniff gave him leave to cultivate this instrument.

I was convinced, after all, that they were just <b>as</b> good <b>as,</b> <b>if</b> not better than, most bands who did. But the moment I said anything like that, i risked incurring the wrath of MRR, 'the punks,' and, most of all, my partner.|$|R
