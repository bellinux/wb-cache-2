5000|$|Racking or {{soutirage}} is {{a traditional}} method in wine production of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump. The process is repeated when the casks are moved to the second-year cellar. Soutirage {{was developed in the}} Bordeaux region of France in the 19th century {{at a time when there}} was no electricity to power pumps. Many estates such in Bordeaux and some estates in Pomerol and St. Emillion still employ this labor-intensive method. During aging, the wine is decanted several times from barrel to barrel. This process softens tannins, clarifies the wine and enhances aromatic qualities. According to Oz Clarke, [...] "traditionally the wine is 'racked' or drawn from barrel or tank to another empty one on a number of occasions (called soutirage). This helps clarify and freshen the wine by removing the <b>fine</b> <b>lees</b> or sediment which forms and provides a tiny amount of oxygen to help the aging process. The wine may also be 'fined' (collage) using egg white or other materials to settle out particles in suspension which are then removed through further racking." [...] Egg white is often applied to each barrel during the process. Twomey Cellars's Napa Valley Merlot is made using the soutirage process.|$|E

40|$|Final thesis {{deals with}} {{research}} of exploitation of "sur lie" method in production of white wine. The focus is given on stability of wine, especially, stability against crystallization of tartrate salt acid in bottle, proteins stability and antioxidative nature of <b>fine</b> <b>lees.</b> First {{part of the}} thesis describes process of wine production by method of aging on <b>fine</b> <b>lees.</b> Composition of lees and cells of Sacharomyces cerevisiae together with its risks and benefits are illustrated in theoretical part. Experimental work monitored development of the wine stability in micro samples. The wine used for research purposes was variety of Silvánske zelené. Antioxidative capacity was monitored by FRAP method {{in the time of}} 16 weeks. Stability of proteins was measured by heat protein test and by turbidity meter. Content of tartrate salt was measured by filtration of samples and then weigh on laboratory scales. Sensory analysis was made by blind wine tasting degustation of professional commission. The results confirm higher protein stability which is about 30 % more than in control sample. Risk of tartrate salt crystallization was reduced about 80 % in comparison with initial state. Antioxidative capacity of wine demonstrates slight decrease, but real required dose of SO 2 added into wine was reduced.

40|$|Aims: Volatile phenols (4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol) affect wine quality by imparting, above certain concentrations, aroma defects. This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of some common oenological practices on the concentration of volatile phenols and the sensory impact of these odour-active compounds in wines. Methods and results: The studied oenological practices {{were based on the}} addition of gum arabic, mannoproteins, yeast cell walls, lees, oak chips, dairy cream and potassium caseinate and on the application of a bubbled nitrogen stream. These treatments were applied to naturally contaminated wines containing volatile phenols at concentrations above detection threshold. The treated wines were characterised by chemical and sensory analysis. The most effective treatments in the reduction of the concentration of volatile phenols were the addition of <b>fine</b> <b>lees,</b> cream and potassium caseinate. Apart from being able to partially remove these compounds (approximately 35 % removal), <b>fine</b> <b>lees</b> contributed to a greater “freshness” and complexity of the wines. Although the addition of cream did decrease the sensory impact of volatile phenols, it did not benefit the wines as these were strongly marked by dairy aromas. The use of oak chips, although it did not have a notable effect on the removal of volatile phenols, led to a significant reduction in the perception of these compounds...|$|E

During the course of former experiments, it was proven that yeasts were able to reduce the polyphenolic composition of wines. As part of the research for the present publication, the change of polyphenolic content in ‘Chardonnay’ wines kept on the lees was analysed. In addition the quantity of tyrosol, required for the forming of simple phenolics, was examined. The results proved that yeasts reduced the quantity of polyphenolics. In addition, due to the increased amino acid concentration, yeasts reduced the quantity of tyrosol that is derived from the amino acid called tyrosine...|$|E

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} are {{key components}} of wine, since they contribute to wine characteristics such as colour, astringency and bitterness. They also act like antioxidants, with mechanisms involving free-radical scavenging that could prevent cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The aim of the present work was to compare the obtained results of total polyphenols content and antioxidant potential (AOP) of several white wines (welschriesling and sauvignon blanc) during ageing on <b>fine</b> <b>lees.</b> The total polyphenols content decreased in average for 16. 1 % in welschriesling wines and for 18. 7 % in sauvignon blanc wines {{in the period of}} three months of wine ageing on lees.

40|$|During the ageing in barrels, {{the contact}} with the <b>fine</b> <b>lees</b> {{triggers}} several processes in wine. Lees has a reductive effect by absorbing dissolved oxygen and reducing the amount, which {{will remain in the}} wine. At present, minimizing the addition of sulphur dioxide is the trend in all viticultural areas. In this study, the effect of various sulphur dioxide levels was monitored in presence of the lees to determine which dose is appropriate to provide the protection of susceptible white wine against oxidation. Without SO 2 protection, the rH and redox potential changed slightly, so the level of dissolved oxygen seemed to be controlled during the ageing period by the lees, though the antioxidant effect of lees in itself was not appropriate to protect the polyphenol content from chemical oxidation, which led to considerable browning. With the addition of a lower amount of SO 2 — 40 mg l 2, the lees is already able to protect the white wine samples in all aspects...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrasound}} {{technology is}} an innovative technique in food production, however, in winemaking, although some {{research has been}} carried out, the practical application is still in an early stage. The aim of this work is to study the effects produced by the ultrasound on crushed red grapes, lees, and young red wines, in order to verify the possible speeding up of the skin extraction, the polymerization of the phenolic compounds, {{and the release of}} compounds from the yeast cells. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory and in the cellar with a prototype. The frequencies used are variable between 20 and 27 KHz at different amplitudes for times varying from 3 to 10 minutes. The ultrasounds has been applied on crushed grapes before microvinification; during these trials, skins have been removed from the wine after 2, 3 and 4 days and the measured phenolic compounds and anthocyanins content have shown that the ultrasounds can save up to 3 days of maceration, comparing to the traditional treatment that usually takes 5 days. Experiences on white grape in the cellar at 27 KHz, have shown interesting sensory responses and made it possible to eliminate the traditional maceration normally used for extraction of aromas and aromatic precursors. In order to evaluate the effect on the yeasts cell structure after fermentation, some trials have been performed with ultrasounds on <b>fine</b> <b>lees</b> from white wines. The results shown that the release of yeast cell compounds (colloids, proteins, and polysaccharides) was increasing mostly together with the increasing time of the treatment, and only marginally with the increasing amplitude percentage. This rapid release of cell compounds implies an acceleration of the maturation kinetic of wines on lees and it is possible to reduce by several months the period of aging. Also the stabilizing properties of ultrasounds on tannins and anthocyanins have been tested on young red wines, in order to investigate the possibility to accelerate the aging process. Good results have been reached in each test and the use of ultrasound it is proving to be available and promising technology for wine polyphenols evolution, in particular for the evolution of the tannins. Laboratory and cellar experiments allow the use of the industrial application of ultrasounds for the process of maceration of red and white grapes, for the yeast lysis and for the evolution of red wines, more applications are being studied. However, properties and features of plant equipments for large scale application have still to be defined, in order to optimize the process and the costs in industrial scale...|$|E
