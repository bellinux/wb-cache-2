5|$|The RAAF {{began to}} accept Hornets into service in 1985. A21-103 was {{formally}} delivered on 4 May of that year. Two weeks later, A21-101 and 102 were flown from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California to RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales between 16 and 17 May 1985. This <b>ferry</b> <b>flight</b> was conducted as a non-stop journey, and USAF McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender tankers refuelled {{each of the}} Hornets 15 times as they crossed the Pacific. As of 2005 this remained the longest single flight to have been undertaken by F/A-18s. Despite the delays to production in 1987, the final Australian Hornet (A21-57) was delivered on schedule at a ceremony held in Canberra on 16 May 1990. The F/A-18As were allocated serial numbers A21-1 through to A21-57 and the F/A-18Bs were allocated A21-101 to A21-118.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>ferry</b> <b>flight</b> of six F-111Cs {{departed}} McClellan Air Force Base in May 1973. The aircraft first flew to Hickam Air Force Base {{where they}} refueled. On 30 May they flew to Pago Pago International Airport. The {{next day they}} departed for RAAF Base Amberley, and arrived there on 1 June (Australian time). The remaining six F-111Cs began their <b>ferry</b> <b>flight</b> on 23 July, and used the same route as the first. Once this flight was completed and all twelve F-111Cs had arrived in Australia, the Washington Flying Unit was disbanded on 26 July 1973.

25|$|Following this, several {{aircraft}} {{were transferred}} to the Soviet military, which used them as staff transports and to train cosmonauts in zero gravity. However, after a Tu-104 crash in February 1981 killed 52 people (17 of whom were senior army and naval staff), the type was permanently removed from service.

25|$|A CAF {{maintenance}} team {{arrived at}} China Lake on 31 March 1971 and in only nine weeks, {{with the help}} of more CAF volunteers, they restored all systems and replaced fuel, oil and hydraulic hoses. The restoration process involved cannibalizing parts from other B-29s at China Lake, installing instruments, having new window bubbles made and restoring controls to working order. After the CAF technicians ran the engines, tested propellers and landing gear, N4249 was made ready to fly again by 3 August 1971. They had a permit to make a single <b>ferry</b> <b>flight</b> out of China Lake although once it landed, the B-29 would be grounded.|$|E

25|$|Ferrying Mosquitos {{and many}} other types of WWII {{aircraft}} from Canada to Europe was dangerous, resulting in losses of lives and machines, but in the exigencies of war it was regarded as the best option for twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft.. Considerable efforts were made by de Havilland Canada to resolve problems with engine and oil systems and an additional five hours of flight testing were introduced before the <b>ferry</b> <b>flight.</b> Although this {{reduced the number of}} aircraft missing, the actual cause of some of the losses was unknown. Nevertheless, {{by the end of the}} war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been ferried successfully by the Canadian operation.|$|E
25|$|October 25, 1999 – San Jose Police Department McDonnell Douglas 500N {{helicopter}} N904PD {{lost control}} while entering the traffic pattern at SJC during a maintenance <b>ferry</b> <b>flight.</b> The helicopter crashed onto The Alameda, near highway 880, killing a San Jose Police Officer/pilot, Desmond Casey, and the helicopter's mechanic, {{who were on}} board. There were no reported damage or injuries on the ground. The NTSB determined that temporary repairs made in order to ferry the helicopter back to SJC, actually made the controllability problem that {{was intended to be}} solved, worse. Pilot manuals and training for the NOTAR (no tail rotor) helicopter did not provide adequate preparation for the pilot, who was experienced in conventional helicopters, to recover from a stuck thruster condition which occurred.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1983, C-5A 70-0446 {{crashed on}} landing at Shemya, Alaska. The C-5 {{approached}} below the glide slope, hit an embankment {{short of the}} runway and bounced back into the air before coming {{to rest on the}} runway. Structural damage was extensive and the two aft main landing gear bogies were sheared from the aircraft. There were no fatalities. A joint USAF/Lockheed team made repairs enabling a one-time <b>ferry</b> <b>flight</b> from Shemya to the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia. There, the aircraft was quickly christened Phoenix II and permanent repair efforts got under way. In addition to the structural repairs, Phoenix II also received an improved landing gear system (common to the then-new C-5B), wing modification, and a color weather radar upgrade. The aircraft was returned to service.|$|E
