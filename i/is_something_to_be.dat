Professor William J. Devlin and coauthor Shai Biderman examined Khan's character compared to the Übermensch and found that Khan's blind pursuit of revenge is against Nietzsche's ideals of transcendence and self-creation of a meaningful life. Instead, the authors offer Spock's self-sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan as a better example of the Übermensch.|$|E

There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there <b>is</b> <b>something...</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are.

Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop and think about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other.

500|$|Both {{feminist and}} Muslim critics have accused Jasmine of being [...] "an {{offensive}} role model unworthy of showcasing to impressionable young girls." [...] According to Meghan O'Keefe of Overthinking It, Jasmine possesses [...] "tremendous" [...] yet [...] "ineffectual... {{potential to be}} a feminist heroine" [...] due to her lack of interest in books, music, social interaction and [...] "thirst for learning" [...] that Ariel and Belle share. O'Keefe concluded, [...] "Jasmine's complaints to Aladdin about palace life sound less like a budding feminist finding her voice, and more like the spoiled muse of Pulp's 'Common People'". Charles I. Schuster, author of Speculations: Readings in Culture, Identity, and Values, agreed that the character offers very little feminism apart from her [...] "defiance of an arbitrary law". Busts Sholeh Hajmiragha began by praising Jasmine's progressiveness: [...] "she challenges her ascribed life as a princess, is skeptical of marriage, and, by falling in love with poor Aladdin, upsets the class system." [...] However, in the end the author criticized the character for being [...] "very sexualized", explaining, [...] "While female sexuality <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud and in control of, it maybe isn't the best message for young girls." [...] Opining that Jasmine's role lacks significance, Feminist Fiction deemed her an example of how [...] "Disney treats its female characters when they're not the protagonist of the story", elaborating, [...] "it looks like Disney put a lot of effort into giving Jasmine girl power and independence, at least in her dialogue and attitude" [...] but [...] "didn't follow through and give her strength in the plot itself." [...] The website also observed that the character's feminism does not appear to extend beyond [...] "lipservice", ultimately criticizing Jasmine of using her sexuality instead of her intelligence to [...] "save the day" [...] before finally reverting to the role of a damsel in distress awaiting rescue. The Routledge Companion to Media & Gender author Cynthia Carter believes that Jasmine becomes [...] "the possession of [...] husband".|$|E

[...] The Forum began to take on even more changes upon the arrival of Julius Casear who drew out extensive plans for the market hub. While Casear's death came prematurely, the ideas himself, as well as Augustus had in regards to the Forum proved to be the most influential for years to come. According to Walter Dennison's The Roman Forum As Cicero Saw It, the author writes that [...] "the diverting of public business to the larger and splendid imperial fora erected in the vicinity resulted in leaving the general design of the Forum Romanum".|$|E

In this spirit, these Christians teach that each day and all Sabbaths should be kept holy, in Christ's teachings. Hebrew-Christian, Sacred Name, and Armstrong movement churches (such as the Living Church of God) usually reject Easter in favor of Nisan 14 observance and celebration of the Christian Passover. This {{is especially true of}} Christian groups that celebrate the New Moons or annual High Sabbaths in addition to seventh-day Sabbath. They support this textually with reference to the letter to the Colossians: [...] "Let no one... pass judgment on you in matters of food and drink or with regard to a festival or new moon or sabbath. These are shadows of things to come; the reality belongs to Christ." [...] (Col. 2:16–17, NAB) ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{compelling}} reason why Mendelssohn and Mahler are commonly considered Jewish composers are {{because they have}} been repeatedly identified as such both by anti-Semites and Jews. In both cases contemporaries (respectively, Richard Wagner in his Das Judenthum in der Musik, and the virulent Vienna press and Austrian anti-Semites such as Rudolph Louis) argued that no matter how much the composer in question attempted to pass himself off as a good Austrian/German and a good Christian, he and his music would remain fundamentally and unalterably Jewish (in the context, with an obviously negative connotation). Therefore, when Nazi Germany suppressed what they considered [...] "degenerate music", both Mendelssohn and Mahler were banned as Jewish composers; they were contrasted with [...] "good" [...] German composers like Beethoven, Bruckner and Wagner (to a lesser degree concerning Wagner but {{especially in the case of}} Beethoven, the fact that the Nazi propagandists claimed that deceased, and therefore unable to object composers are personifications of their ideology does not mean that they would have approved of such a label). The claim of [...] "fundamental Jewishness" [...] was repeated, but with a completely opposite meaning, by 20th century Jews like Leonard Bernstein (regarding Mahler), who viewed that the dual Jewishness and success of the composers <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> championed and celebrated.

2500|$|Walt Disney Pictures {{announced}} that a live-action remake of The Jungle Book was in development on July 9, 2013, with Justin Marks set to write the script. The film would be Disney's second live-action adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's works, following the 1994 film, and the studio's third overall after the 1967 animated musical. Jon Favreau was later confirmed as director on November 5, 2013. Favreau as a child used to watch Disney's 1967 animated musical version. He {{felt the need to}} strike a balance between the two films by retaining the buoyant spirit of the 1967 film, including some of its memorable songs, while crafting a movie with more realism and peril. He also stressed the importance of nature and realized how things have shifted during Kipling's time and now, [...] "In Kipling's time, nature was something to be overcome. Now nature <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected." [...] He was encouraged by Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn to take advantage of the film's setting and story as an opportunity to use the latest advancements in photorealistic rendering, computer-generated imagery, and motion capture technologies. The story of the film is not independently taken from Kipling's works, but also borrows cinematic inspirations from other films, including the child-mentor relationship in Shane (1953), the establishment of rules in a dangerous world from Goodfellas (1990) and the use of a shadowy jungle figure in Apocalypse Now (1979).|$|E
