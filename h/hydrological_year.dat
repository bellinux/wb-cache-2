The research is conducted in a gauged mountainous watershed (15. 18 km 2) that is located on the eastern side of Penteli Mountain, in the prefecture of Attica, Greece and the study period concerns the years from 2003 to 2008. The decrease in the annual rainfall depth during the last two <b>hydrological</b> <b>years</b> 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008 is 10 % and 35 %, respectively, in relation to the average of the previous years.

40|$|Abstract: The {{determination}} of water-budget parameters, such as change in storage and subsurface inflow and outflow, is costly and unreliable due to heterogeneities of karst aquifers. Some karst aquifers may {{have one or}} a combination of boundaries such as impermeable formations, alluvial aquifers, and known ground-water divides. Karst water only discharges through springs or flows to the adjacent alluvium. A new procedure is proposed to estimate volume of storage in region during the dry season in these settings. The subsurface inflow and outflow can be measured in the adjacent alluvium using equipotential and flow lines, cross-sectional area, and transmissivity of the alluvial aquifer. The dry season makes it possible to calculate the karst spring recession coefficient and karst aquifer dynamic volume {{at the beginning and end}} of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>year.</b> The change of storage is the difference between the dynamic volumes of the karst aquifer at the beginning and end of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>year.</b> The volume of water which flows to the adjacent alluvium or spring is measured by plotting the discharge as a function of time and estimating the recession coefficient at the beginning (or end) of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>year.</b> Known equations are used to calculate the dynamic volume of springs. A general equation is proposed to calculate the dynamic volume of a karst aquifer when there is a combination of springs, and subsurface inflow and outflow from the karst aquifer.

A number of drought indices have been developed based on NOAA-AVHRR data exploiting the remote sensing potential at different temporal scales. In this paper, the remotely sensed Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) is employed for the quantification of drought. RDI enables the assessment of hydro-meteorological drought, since it uses hydrometeorological parameters, such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The study area is Thessaly, central Greece, which is a drought-prone agricultural region characterized by vulnerable agriculture. Several drought features are analyzed and assessed by using monthly RDI images over the period 1981 - 2001 : severity, areal extent, duration, periodicity, onset and end time. The results show an increase in the areal extent during each drought episode and that droughts are classified into two classes, namely small areal extent drought and large areal extent drought, respectively, lasting 12 or 13 months coinciding closely with the <b>hydrological</b> <b>year.</b> The onset of large droughts coincides with the beginning of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>year,</b> whereas the onset of small droughts is in spring.

The accuracy and window size of the temporal filter were assessed using a simulation approach. Spatial and temporal characteristics of snow cover in the watershed were then analyzed.

Thirteen scenarios were defined to fully understand the N&P and chlorophyll a (Chl a) variation among different <b>hydrological</b> <b>years,</b> different quantity and timing of water transfer, and different inflows of N&P concentrations. The results showed the following: (a) The water transfer project would not result in a substantial difference to the trophic state of the Miyun reservoir in any of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>years.</b> (b) The area affected by the water transfer did not involve the entire reservoir. To minimize the impact of water transfer on N&P nutrients and Chl a, water should be transferred as uniform as possible with small discharge. (c) The variation in Chl a was more sensitive to an increase in P than an increase in N for the transferred water. The increased percentages of the average Chl a concentration when water was transferred in the spring, summer and autumn were 7. 76 %, 16. 67 % and 16. 45 %. Our findings imply that special attention should be given to prevent P increment of the transferred water from May to October to prevent algal blooms.
