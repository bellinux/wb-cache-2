40|$|The {{measures}} {{proposed in}} the "family package" {{have the effect of}} excluding from taxation about half of the costs of raising children. Various computations show that the majority of those obligated to provide child support fare better under the proposed regulation which provides for tax credits of 700 ATS per child per month and for an increase in the family allowance than under a rule which provides that half of the child support (compiled according to the percentage method) is tax exempt. The advantages of the new regulation decrease with the age and the number of children. This disadvantage is offset, however, for earners of low income with more than three children by the new supplement of 400 ATS per month, which is financed by the <b>Family</b> <b>Allowance</b> <b>Fund.</b> The "family package" will raise personal disposable income by ATS 12 billion in the year 2000 and the following years, stimulating private consumption and thus boosting employment.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of {{eligibility}} for a free means-tested complementary health insurance plan, called Couverture Maladie Universelle Complémentaire (CMUC), on doctor visits. We use information on the selection rule {{to qualify for the}} plan to identify the effect of eligibility and adopt a regression discontinuity approach. Our sample consists of low-income individuals enrolled in the Health Insurance Fund and recipients of social benefits from the <b>Family</b> <b>Allowance</b> <b>Fund</b> of an urban area in Northern France. Our findings do not show significant impacts of the CMUC threshold on the number of doctor visits within the full sample. Among the subsample of adults under 30 years old, however, eligible individuals are more likely to see a specialist and have, on average, significantly more specialist visits than non-eligible individuals. This specific impact of the CMUC cut-off point among young adults may be {{explained by the fact that}} young adults are less likely to be covered by a complementary health insurance plan when they are not recipients of the CMUC plan.

5000|$|Fabius {{advocated}} {{a new kind}} of French socialism, which accepted the market economy. In social policy, a law of December 1984 replaced allowance for orphans with a <b>family</b> support <b>allowance,</b> and empowered <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>funds</b> to aid in recovery of child support when a parent fails to pay. The allowable income for recipients of the young child allowance was increased (July 1984) for families with three or more children. The Fabius Government also sought to reduce penalties on families with working mothers by substantially increasing the income ceiling for dual-income families receiving the young child allowance. A parental education fund was created (1985), which provided for payments to each person who stops work or reduces hours of work {{as a result of the}} birth of any child beyond the first two, for which the parent(s) is/are responsible. In 1985, as a means of upholding the rights of homosexuals, the penal code was amended to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of [...] "moral habits" [...] which included sexual orientation.|$|R
50|$|Established by the Finance Act 1991, {{the general}} social {{contribution}} (CSG) is payable by individuals living in France and who benefit from the compulsory health insurance. Revenues from the CSG are allocated to social security budget, specifically to the National <b>Family</b> <b>Allowance,</b> the Solidarity <b>Fund</b> pension schemes and insurance. Indeed, unlike the social contributions that give those who pay a right to benefit from them, the CSG, is levied without direct compensation (like any other tax). The CSG has a very broad base as it applies in principle to earnings and income from wealth. The CSG is composed of three separate contributions. Incomes from work are taxed at 7.5%. The rate applied to income from investments is 8.2%. It also applies to financial investment (with exceptions for certain untaxable products : Codevi, livret jeune, livret A, livret d'epargne populaire). In 2005, the revenue from the CSG amounted to €71.47 bn.|$|R
30|$|We also draw on 42 {{interviews}} conducted {{as part of}} the qualitative post-survey that followed the TeO. The sub-populations were selected before the response to the call for research projects by the French <b>Family</b> <b>Allowance</b> <b>Fund</b> (Caisse nationale des allocations familiales - CNAF), which funded these interviews. The original intention was to re-interview some of the individuals with successful educational pathways as well as children of immigrants who occupy an elite position in order to study the mechanisms of success. The qualitative section of the project submitted to the CNAF (entitled “Number of siblings and educational and socio-occupational destinies of the children of immigrants”) examines (i) the pathways of these successful individuals and (ii) also highlights the pathways of unsuccessful individuals (other siblings who did not attain the same educational level as the respondents) by focusing on the influence of family dynamics, specifically those between siblings. The children of immigrants (born or socialised in France) who were re-interviewed were {{selected on the basis of}} the geographical origin of their parents (Maghreb, sub-Saharan Africa or Turkey), their social class (working class), their educational level (at least two years of higher education) and their age (25 – 40). The rationale for the last criterion was to analyse completed educational pathways that took place in a comparable educational environment. The biographical interviews reveal changes in family involvement over time and provide more detail than the fairly basic indicators in the statistical survey.|$|E

This 1952 decision expounding {{the meaning of the}} unconditional most-favoured-nation principle is often cited for the proposition that origin-based conditions are inconsistent with that core principle. This article reconsiders <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> through the window of Professor Hudec s classic case study written in 1975. In particular, the article considers whether the panel and Professor Hudec correctly interpreted the term unconditionally, in light of the pre- 1947 international trade law practices. In addition, the article explores the status of <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> as the first GATT case holding that a governmental social program violated trade rules. Although Belgium did not invoke GATT Article XX as a defense, this paper assesses how current WTO jurisprudence would be applied to the facts in <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances,</b> and concludes that Belgium would still lose the case. ...|$|R
