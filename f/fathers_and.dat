5|$|Bart's {{character}} traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Each person {{belongs to}} both the mother's and the father's families, the only {{bilateral}} family line in Indonesia. Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from both mother and father, including land and even family debts. Children's names are given {{on the basis of}} kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> siblings.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Fonda {{had a small}} role in The Butler, portraying First Lady Nancy Reagan. She {{had more}} film work the {{following}} year, appearing in the comedies Better Living Through Chemistry and This is Where I Leave You. She also voiced a character on The Simpsons. She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino's Youth in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. Her upcoming film roles include <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> Daughters with Russell Crowe.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writings}} of the early Church Fathers talk sometimes of the Holy Spirit as coming from the <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> the Son. These writings {{can be used to}} support either the Latin idea of the procession of the Holy Spirit, or the Orthodox idea. [...] The {{writings of}} the Church fathers, announcing that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> the Son do not necessarily lend their support to either the Catholic position or the Orthodox one. The statement that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> the Son can be used to support either position; that the Spirit comes from the <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> through the Son, or from <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> Son as principal cause.|$|R

5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E

He would later take the lead in opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Council. Refusing to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by its members, he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> {{over the course}} of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our <b>Fathers,</b> <b>and,</b> being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{complete}} prehistorical skeleton found in Portugal, the Lapedo child, had features of both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals. Some ancient human skulls with especially large nasal cavities and unusually shaped braincases represent human-Neanderthal hybrids. A 37,000- to 42,000-year-old human jawbone found in Romania's Oase cave contains traces of Neanderthal ancestry from only {{four to six}} generations earlier. All genes from Neanderthals in the current human population are descended from Neanderthal <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> human mothers. A Neanderthal skull unearthed in Italy in 1957 reveals Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on through only the maternal lineage, but the skull has a chin shape similar to modern humans. It is proposed {{that it was the}} offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a human father.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly was {{a product}} of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the {{theology}} of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E
