40|$|An {{investigation}} of steady and unsteady flow phenomena in centrifugal compressors has been performed. In particular, {{the effect of}} vaned diffuser geometry on the compressor unsteady aerodynamics has been considered, with particular emphasis on the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> unsteady loading generated by the impeller circumferentially nonuniform flowfield. A series of experiments was performed in the Purdue Centrifugal Compressor Facility to quantify the compressor performance, impeller blade and <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> steady surface static pressure, vaneless diffuser steady and unsteady velocity field, <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> unsteady surface static pressure, as well as surge and rotating stall occurrence. These measurements were made for various flow rates, number of diffuser vanes, <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> leading edge/impeller exit radius ratios, <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> stagger angles, and nonuniform circumferential vane spacing. ^ In conjunction with the above experiments, theoretical predictions of the unsteady vaneless diffuser wake velocities and the unsteady <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> loading were developed. The linearized unsteady Euler equations were solved to predict the wake behavior, with a conformal transformation applied to existing axial flow cascade theory for unsteady <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> loading predictions. ^ It {{was found that the}} compressor performance could be improved through use of a vaned diffuser, with the greatest performance improvement with zero steady loading on the vanes. The unsteady wake velocity in the radial diffuser was seen to decrease rapidly with increasing radius. The decrease was greater than predicted by the theory, with the unsteady circumferential pressure gradient and the phase angle between the radial and tangential unsteady velocities determined to be important parameters. ^ The <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> unsteady loading was determined to be a strong function of flow rate and number of diffuser vanes, with the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> leading edge/impeller exit radius ratio important for smaller numbers of vanes. The correlation with theory was poor with a high <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> row solidity, although fair correlation was seen with moderate solidity. ^ Finally, the vaned diffuser row {{had a significant impact on}} surge and rotating stall margins and behavior.

ChapmanThis thesis {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a centrifugal compressor model for the Turbocharger Component Matching System (TuCMS) software package {{that can be used to}} inexpensively analyze turbocharger performance. The TuCMS can also be used to match turbocharger components to integrate and optimize turbocharger-engine performance. The software system is being developed with the intent to reduce the time taken to experimentally match a turbocharger with an engine, a task that is key to engine emission reductions. The TuCMS uses one-dimensional thermo-fluid equations to analyze the compressor side of a turbocharger. For each compressor component, the program calculates the velocities, pressures, temperatures, pressure losses, work consumption, and efficiencies for a specified set of turbocharger geometry, atmospheric conditions, rotational speed, and fluid mass flow rate. The compressor includes established loss models found in the open literature. The TuCMS utilizes a component-based architecture to simplify model enhancements. The TuCMS can be used as a cost effective engineering tool for preliminary turbocharger testing during engine upgrades and modifications. In this thesis, the TuCMS compressor model was used as an analysis tool to further understand the Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) experimental results. The VGT is a unique turbocharger that can change the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> angle over a wide range of positions. The change in <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> angle results in optimal turbocharger performance at various operating conditions, and potentially increases the operating range.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is quite}} {{well known that}} the {{diffusers}} are required for efficient conversion of the dynamic head generated by the impeller in a centrifugal fan. Hence the flow into the diffuser passage {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the efficiency of conversion. The flow in the region bounded by the impeller exit and the diffuser entry i. e. the radial clearance space is generally considered to be highly complex. With the development of PIV as well as versatile numerical CFD tools such as moving mesh techniques, it has become possible to arrive at a prudent solution compatible with the physical nature of the flow. Hence, in this work a numerical solution with moving mesh technique is made use of in predicting the real flow behavior, as exhibited when a target blade of the impeller is made to move past a target blade on the diffuser. Many research works both experimental and numerical on the impeller diffuser interactive phenomenon have been undertaken so far. But it is found from the literature that the study on the impeller diffuser interaction as well on the performance of the fan by varying the number of <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> has not been the focus of attention in these works.

Two different impellers were used, {{one half of the}} impeller of the double suction pump of the HPOTP (High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump) of the SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engine), and a two-dimensional impeller. The measurements were made for different flow coefficients, shaft speeds, and radial gaps between the impeller blades and the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes</b> (1. 5 % and 4. 5 % of the impeller discharge radius for the impeller of the HPOTP, and 5 % and 8 % for the two-dimensional impeller). The vane pressure fluctuations were larger on the vane suction than on the vane pressure side attaining their maximum value, of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump, near the leading edge. The resulting lift on the vane, both steady and unsteady, was computed from the pressure measurements at mid vane height. The magnitude of the fluctuating lift was found to be larger than the steady lift. For the impeller of the HPOTP, pressure measurements on the front shroud of a vaned and a vaneless diffuser showed that the front shroud pressure fluctuations increased with the presence of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes.</b> For the two-dimensional impeller, also unsteady impeller blade pressure measurements were made. The largest blade pressure fluctuations, of the same magnitude as the large pressure fluctuations on the vane suction side, occurred at the blade trailing edge.

40|$|This {{research}} program focuses on characterizing {{the effect of}} impeller-diffuser interactions in a centrifugal compressor stage on its performance using unsteady threedimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. The computed {{results show that the}} interaction between the downstream diffuser pressure field and the impeller tip clearance flow can account for performance changes in the impeller. The magnitude of performance change due to this interaction was examined for an impeller with varying tip clearance followed by a vaned or vaneless diffuser. The impact of unsteady impeller-diffuser interaction, primarily through the impeller tip clearance flow, is reflected through a time-averaged change in impeller loss, blockage and slip. The results show that there exists a tip clearance where the beneficial effect of the impeller-diffuser interaction on the impeller performance is at a maximum. A flow feature that consists of tip flow back leakage was shown to occur at design speed for the centrifugal compressor stage. This flow phenomenon is described as tip flow that originates in one passage, flows downstream of the impeller trailing edge and then returns to upstream of the impeller trailing edge of a neighboring passage. Such a flow feature is a source of loss in the impeller. A hypothesis is put forth to show that changing the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> count and changing impeller-diffuser gap has an analogous effect on the impeller performance. The centrifugal compressor stage was analyzed using diffusers of different vane counts, producing an impeller performance trend similar to that when the impeller-diffuser gap was varied, thus supporting the hypothesis made.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the work aiming for tonal noise reduction in a centrifugal fan. In previous studies, {{it is well}} documented that tonal noise is the dominant noise source generated in centrifugal fans. Tonal noise is generated due to the aerodynamic interaction between the rotating impeller and stationary <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes.</b> The generation of tonal noise {{is related to the}} pressure fluctuation at {{the leading edge of the}} stationary vane. The tonal noise is periodic in time which occurs at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and its harmonics. Much of previous studies, have shown that the stationary vane causes the tonal noise and generation of non-rotational turbulent noise. However, omitting stationary vanes will lead to the increase of non-rotational turbulent noise resulted from the high velocity of the flow leaving the impeller. Hence in order to reduce the tonal noise and the non-rotational noise, guide vanes were designed as part of this study to replace the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes,</b> which were originally used in the chosen centrifugal fan. The leading edge of the guide vane is tapered. This modification reduces the strength of pressure fluctuation resulting from the interaction between the impeller outflow and stationary vane. The sound pressure level at blade passing frequency (BPF) is reduced by 6. 8 dB, the 2 nd BPF is reduced by 4. 1 dB and the 3 rd BPF reduced by about 17. 5 dB. The overall reduction was 0. 9 dB. The centrifugal fan with tapered guide vanes radiates lower tonal noise compared to the existing <b>diffuser</b> <b>vanes.</b> These reductions are achieved without compromising the performance of the centrifugal fan.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} three-dimensional {{flow field}} for two centrifugal compressors of nearly identical design (one with a marginally smaller impeller-diffuser gap) is interrogated to assess {{the difference in the}} time averaged performance and unsteady loading characteristics of the impeller blades. Computational calculations are conducted for three different operating points. Results show that the difference in the time-average performance of the two compressors is due to the change in the level of loss and blockage generated from a difference in the strength of the impeller-diffuser interaction between the two compressors. The unsteady component of loading on the impeller blade originates from pressure waves propagating with a phase difference on the suction and pressure surfaces of the blades. The frequency of the waves is set by the diffuser vanes passing frequency and the wavelength by the product of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>vane</b> passing period and the speed of the wave. It is demonstrated that the difference in static pressure from the pressure surface to the suction surface at {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes sets the amplitude of unsteady loading on the blades of the impeller.
