25|$|Many Indian {{provinces and}} princely states imposed inter-provincial trade {{barriers}} beginning in mid-1942, preventing other provinces from buying domestic rice.

The power to restrict inter-provincial trade had been conferred on provincial governments in November 1941 as an item under the Defence of India Act, 1939. Provincial governments began erecting trade barriers that prevented the flow of <b>foodgrains</b> (especially rice) and other goods between provinces.

25|$|Throughout 1942 {{and into}} early 1943, a complex series of {{overlapping}} crises placed enormous, widespread stress on Bengal's economy, particularly on its more vulnerable segments.

As Bengal's food needs rose from increased military presence and an influx of refugees from Burma, its ability to obtain rice and other <b>foodgrains</b> from outside the province was restricted by interprovincial trade barriers. The outlook of the typical Bengali, particularly in the countryside, deteriorated into a general belief in the inevitability of famine and devastating inflation, a lack {{of faith in the}} government's ability to overcome the crises, and a mood of isolation and panic. In nearly every sector of the population, the overriding concerns were the lack of food and personal safety, though a small number secured record profits amidst the havoc.|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to about}} 1920, the food demands of Bengal's growing {{population}} could be met {{in part by}} bringing undeveloped lands under the plough. Probably {{around the turn of}} the twentieth century, and certainly no later than the early 1930s, Bengal began to experience an acute shortage of land and a chronic and growing shortage of rice. Bengal's agricultural inability to keep pace with rapid population growth changed it from a net exporter to a net importer of <b>foodgrains.</b> Although imports constituted a small part of the total production, this may have been accompanied by a decrease in average consumption levels; it was estimated in 1930 that the Bengali diet was the least nutritious in the world: ...|$|E

2500|$|Even before 1942, with {{uncertainty}} prevailing about the war, rice cultivators were proceeding with caution, and parting with their produce less readily. Large-scale government {{investment in a}} war-related economy had created inflation. The larger workforce, keen to secure its supplies, was buying more. The price of rice in September 1941 was already 69% higher than in August 1939. [...] With the fall of Burma, there was increased demand on the rice producing regions from those regions which more critically relied on Burmese imports. This, according to the Famine Commission, was occurring in a market in which the [...] "progress of the war made sellers who could afford to wait reluctant to sell." [...] The Japanese attack had not only provoked a scramble for rice across India, but had also caused a dramatic and unprecedented price inflation in Bengal, and in other rice producing regions of India. [...] In Bengal, {{the impact of the}} loss of Burma rice on price levels was vastly disproportionate {{to the size of the}} loss. Despite this, the export of Bengal rice to other regions of India increased during the first half of 1942. [...] In the first seven months of 1942, these exports totaled some 319,000 tons in contrast to 136,000 tons over the same period in 1941; the imports, however, had reduced by 300,000 tons in that same time. [...] Under pressure from the UK, Bengal continued to export rice to Ceylon for months afterward, even as the beginning of a food crisis began to become apparent. [...] The influx of refugees created more demand for food. More clothing and medical aid were needed, further straining the resources of the province.

40|$|As Chinese {{consumption}} of feed-related food increases, demand for feed and hence feedgrain {{has attracted a}} lot of attention both inside and outside China. This is not only because of food security concern but also due to the potential implication for international trade given the sheer size of the Chinese market. This paper deals with some of the issues associated with China's demand for feedgrain. In particular, it sheds light on the relationship between feedgrain requirement and <b>foodgrain</b> consumption in China. It especially focuses on examining the impact of economic growth and demographic changes on demand for feedgrain in the near future.

40|$|The crux of {{agricultural}} development in India {{is to maintain}} a rising level of <b>foodgrain</b> production {{and a reduction in}} rural poverty by speedy growth of income and employment. The new seed-fertiliser based technology has helped the farmers achieve the first goal of food security, because priority for <b>foodgrain</b> production is rightly compatible with subsistence orientation {{of the majority of the}} farmers- especially marginal and small farmers. In the past, it was believed and in fact verified by several studies that the new technology is scale neutral and the poor would share at least equally with rich in the gains from the technology. This has not happened and poverty persists. It is a paradox that a record <b>foodgrain</b> production of 186 million metric tonnes in 1994 - 95 coexists with nearly a third of the country's population living below the poverty line. Indeed, the economic inequalities have widened over the years, revealing that integrating capitalist agriculture with welfare goals is more formidable than earlier thought of. One reason is the lack of adequate attention in policies and programmes for agricultural development to the need for rapid commercialization of agriculture.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{research}} literature which quantifies the important contributions of public, private and human capital to economic growth and poverty reduction. However, studies based on the endogenous growth model tend to exclude the effects of relative prices on economic growth. This paper develops a simple growth model which details the effects of minimum producer support prices and maximum consumer issue prices on Indian <b>foodgrain</b> production and rural poverty, subject to a long run government budget constraint. The major structural changes in the non-stationary variables are endogenously identified over the period 1951 to 2001 and the Johansen FIML procedure is used to derive efficient estimates of important long run elasticities. It is found that a one per cent increase in the real minimum producer support price for wheat will increase real <b>foodgrain</b> production per rural worker by 1. 3 per cent {{in the long run}}. Similarly, a one per cent reduction in the real consumer maximum issue price for wheat (via the public distribution system) will reduce the rural head count poverty ratio by 1. 3 per cent in the long run. The government budget constraint applies in the long run whereby a one per cent increase in the minimum producer support price requires the consumer maximum issue price to increase by 1. 5 per cent. However, these prices can be moved in opposite directions to reduce poverty in the short run. A one per cent increase in the minimum producer support price is found to Granger cause the maximum issue price to fall by 1. 1 per cent in the next year. This dynamic growth analysis confirms that price policy in India since independence has importantly promoted the production of <b>foodgrain</b> and contributed to the reduction in rural poverty. Prices can be powerful policy instruments and the elasticity estimates contained here certainly support this view. <b>foodgrain</b> production, price policies, economic growth, rural poverty...|$|R
