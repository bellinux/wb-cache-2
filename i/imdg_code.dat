40|$|There are {{different}} ways to transport natural gas. One way is to cool it to a temperature of - 162 Â°C and transport it in liquefied form (LNG). This is both a well known and often used method in the shipping industry. It is also possible to compress the natural gas (CNG) and contain it in cylinders / bottles. The development of the latter has only recently begun, and for now, the only real option {{when it comes to}} transportation of gas at sea is LNG. Nevertheless, the concept of CNG is still very interesting because it has the capability of reaching stranded gas reservoirs. Whereas exploitation of these areas using vessels transporting LNG would be far too expensive, shipping companies have with the introduction of CNG developed a much more cost-effective and less time consuming method. CNG has been discussed within the shipping industry since the 1960 s, but it is recently that the technology has become sufficiently developed. It is only just now that one has obtained the means to finance the project and been able to make it profitable. Unfortunately, since CNG only exists in theory and on paper, the regulatory framework around the concept is not completely developed. In an attempt to explain the CNG concept, I will therefore look at not only the technical, but also the economical and legal aspects concerning the subject. In this paper I will show {{that there is a need}} for CNG and that it is a better economical alternative to the LNG system when it comes to transporting gas over shorter distances. I will also show that although well known international classification societies, such as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), have developed their own CNG standards it does not mean that the concept is also covered by the mandatory international regulations produced by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). After analysing the legislations of several international maritime conventions and codes, I will demonstrate that there exists a definition problem in the different conventions and that CNG falls outside the scope of some of the most significant codes. I will firstly evoke the technical aspect of the concept by considering the need for this new type of innovation, before I look into the differences between CNG and LNG to verify the cost-effectiveness of the two methods of transportation. The Norwegian shipping company Knutsen OAS is currently developing a CNG vessel and it will therefore be used as an example to illustrate how the system works in practice. The papers fifth section examines if the international maritime classification societies have acknowledged the CNG concept and what the consequences of this is. I will then look at IMO in the attempt to answer the question if CNG is in compliance with the international conventions SOLAS and MARPOL, before I look into the problems of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods <b>code</b> (<b>IMDG)</b> and the more important International Gas Carrier code (IGC). This is important whereas to the survival of CNG. Finally I will also take into consideration the legal aspects of liability using the Harmful and Noxious Substances convention (HNS) ...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{number of}} {{hazardous}} goods are being carried in containers at sea. The carriage of Containerised Dangerous Goods by sea {{is governed by}} the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (<b>IMDG)</b> <b>Code.</b> International Maritime Organisation (IMO) introduced the <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code</b> in the year 1965 to provide an International Standard of Safety for "Safe Transport of Containerised Dangerous Goods". The <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code</b> has attained mandatory status since 1 ^^ January 2004. Despite an International Code aimed at tightening safety, the shipping community is still beset with problems like misdeclaration and nondeclaration of hazardous goods, poorly trained shore staff, lack of awareness of the <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code,</b> incorrect stowage and non-compliance of packing/labelling/marking/placarding regulations. Container inspection programmes carried out in various countries, reported to IMO, demonstrate deficiencies as high as 40 %. This research highlights need for personnel involved in the carriage of dangerous goods shipments to be fully trained. Hazardous seminars are being carried out globally to enhance awareness of the <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code.</b> There have been nine major fires involving containerised dangerous goods in the past. The research {{draws attention to the}} risk of hazardous incidents involving ships carrying containerised dangerous goods. It supports IMO's objectives for safer ships on cleaner oceans to reduce risk of accidents and pollution. The {{fact that there is a}} cavalier attitude to regulations should cause serious concern to those handling dangerous goods. It is attributed that 80 % of accidents are caused due to human error. The industry should recognise that there is a clear need of creating better work environments. On the whole, the proposal is for a safety management approach that simply formalises good practice, bearing in mind the number of shippers whose cargoes might contribute to an incident involving dangerous goods and to encourage "Safe Transport of Containerised Dangerous Goods" worldwide...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining stowage plans for containers into a ship, which is the so-called master bay plan problem (MBPP). As a novel issue and variant of MBPP, in the present work we consider the stowage of hazardous containers that follows the principles included in the segregation table of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (<b>IMDG)</b> <b>Code.</b> Formally, the MBPP consists in determining how to stow a set of n containers, split into different groups, according to their size, type, class of weight and destinations, into a set of m available slots, that are locations either on the deck or in the stow, of prede-termined bays of a containership. Some structural and operational constraints, re-lated to both the containers and the ship, have to be satisfied. The need of stowing dangerous goods implies {{to take into account}} additional constraints to be verified in each slot concerning the safety of the whole cargo, for which dangerous goods are categorized into different types and forced to be stowed away from incompatible ones. We face such variant of MBPP {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the bin packing problem, where items are containers and the bins are sections of the ship available for the stowage of hazardous containers. In particular, following a step by step procedure for properly loading all containers on board, we show how the segregation rules derived from the <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code</b> impact on the available slots of the bins. A real life case study is reported...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is two-folded; (i) to {{describe}} what cargo safety rules and regulations are applicable for ro-ro vessels based on Norwegian legislation; and (ii) to make a normative case study on how HÃ¶egh Autoliners ensure compliance of the relevant applicable cargo safety rules and regulations. Section 12 in the Ship Safety and Security Act concerns cargo safety. The Act applies for cargo vessels. A ro-ro vessel is a cargo vessel. Hence, requirements set forth in Section 12 apply for ro-ro vessels. Section 12 consists of two paragraphs. First paragraph describes particularly two elements in a broad sense; (i) stability and buoyancy; and (ii) life, health, property or the environment, where the former point shall not be endangered and the latter point not be jeopardized. This paragraph also entails the handling of dangerous goods. This {{is due to the}} fact that life, health, property or the environment can be jeopardized by wrongful handling of dangerous goods. Furthermore, second sentence has delegated authority to NMD to issue detailed regulations concerning cargo and ballast. Second paragraph concerns cargo-handling operations. The term âcargo-handling operationsâ is specifically mentioned given the potential risk the cargo-handling operation represents. Second sentence has delegated authority to NMD to issue detailed regulations concerning cargo-handling operations. There are mainly three requirements for a ro-ro vessel in order to be in compliance with Section 12; (i) safely loaded and ballasted; (ii) safe cargo-handling operations; and (iii) safe handling of dangerous goods. Detailed requirements are set forth in Regulation 785 / 2006 concerning carriage of cargo and Regulation 1481 / 2009 concerning carriage of dangerous goods. These regulations have implemented the relevant international safety rules and regulations in two ways; (i) by verbatim in the respective regulations; and (ii) by reference to SOLAS, CSS Code and <b>IMDG</b> <b>Code.</b> HÃ¶egh Autoliners ensures compliance with the cargo safety rules and regulations through its subsidiary HFS. HFS is considered as the company set forth in Section 4 in the Ship Safety and Security Act. HFS is consequently the responsible company according to cargo safety questions. However, the internal cargo safety rules (based on Norwegian law) are manifested and distributed internally through HACQM. HA is the document owner of HACQM given its cargo handling competence, experience and focus. This entails monitoring applicable cargo safety rules in order to have an updated HACQM. Hence, a close interaction and collaboration between HA and HFS on all cargo safety questions is imperative to ensure compliance of the applicable cargo safety rules. This is of particular importance given the described corporate structure of HÃ¶egh Autoliners...|$|E
