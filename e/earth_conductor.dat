40|$|Abstract- The {{grounding}} system {{plays an important}} part in the lightning protection system of power and communication systems. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is widely used in modeling complex electromagnetic interaction problems. However, it is difficult to model the <b>earthing</b> <b>conductor</b> using the standard FDTD method in the transient grounding resistance analysis, for the electrically small depth of the <b>earthing</b> <b>conductors.</b> In this work, non-uniform grid in the FDTD methods, which is typically used to resolve fine structures, is introduced into reduce the computational domain and therefore lead to a reduction of the computational cost. To further reduce the computational memory, the uniform grids are used in the electrode length direction while non-uniform grids are occupied in the electrode sectional directions. The efficiency of the proposed model has been approved by verifying both the electromagnetic field components near the <b>earthing</b> <b>conductor</b> and the grounding resistance...|$|R

5000|$|In Australia and New Zealand, {{the colour}} of the {{external}} sheath is usually white but several other colours are available. Wire sizes of from 1 mm² to 6 mm² Cross Sectional Area (CSA) are available with the outer sheath covering a [...] "core" [...] of either a single conductor, twin <b>conductors,</b> twin and <b>earth</b> <b>conductors,</b> or three and <b>earth</b> <b>conductors.</b> Although available in the larger sizes, solid conductors are rarely used with wire sizes greater than 1 mm² CSA, since the small extra expense of multi-stranded conductors is far outweighed by the relative ease of working with them, especially at the points of termination.|$|R

2500|$|Equipment <b>earthing</b> <b>conductors</b> {{provide an}} {{electrical}} {{connection between the}} physical ground (earth) and the grounding/bonding system, which connects (bonds) the normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment. According to the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC), the reason for doing this is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, and contact with higher voltage lines.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States National Electrical Code and Canadian Electrical Code {{the feed}} from the {{distribution}} transformer uses a combined neutral and grounding conductor, {{but within the}} structure separate neutral and protective <b>earth</b> <b>conductors</b> are used (TN-C-S). The neutral must be connected to earth only {{on the supply side}} of the customer's disconnecting switch.|$|R
50|$|Unlike in North America, the {{existence}} of the Earth wire within the sheath is always specified if it is present (e.g. twin cable has two conductors and twin and earth cable has three.) The <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> is always multi-stranded (unlike North American usage) and covered with Green/Yellow plastic insulation.|$|E
50|$|Also {{available}} in smaller conductor sizes are versions containing three current-carrying conductors and a circuit protective (<b>earth)</b> <b>conductor.</b> These configurations {{are commonly used}} for applications such as switched light circuits, battery-backed emergency lighting which requires a switched and unswitched supply, extractor fans with a run-on timer which require a switched and unswitched supply, mains-powered interlinked smoke alarms, and central heating thermostats.|$|E
50|$|Traction current {{lines are}} always {{equipped}} with an <b>earth</b> <b>conductor.</b> In some cases, two earth conductors are used: for example in, Germany, {{in cases where the}} traction current line is carried on pylons together with three phase AC current, like the line to the nuclear power station at Neckarwestheim. Similarly, in Austria there are some traction current lines equipped with two earth ropes.|$|E

5000|$|Stray {{voltages}} {{created in}} grounding (<b>earthing)</b> <b>conductors</b> by currents flowing {{in the supply}} utility neutral conductors can be troublesome. For example, special measures may be required in barns used for milking dairy cattle. Very small voltages, not usually perceptible to humans, may cause low milk yield, or even mastitis (inflammation of the udder).So-called [...] "tingle voltage filters" [...] may be required in the electrical distribution system for a milking parlour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earthing}} conductor is uninsulated {{since it is}} not intended to have any voltage difference from surrounding earthed articles. Additionally, if the insulation of a [...] or neutral wire becomes damaged, then the wire is more likely to earth itself on the bare <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> and in doing so either trip the RCD or burn the fuse out by drawing too much current.|$|E
50|$|The {{incoming}} supply and the neutral conductors {{are connected to}} the terminals at (1), and the outgoing load conductors {{are connected to the}} terminals at (2). The <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> (not shown) is connected through from supply to load uninterrupted.When the reset button (3) is pressed, the contacts ((4) and another, hidden behind (5)) close, allowing current to pass. The solenoid (5) keeps the contacts closed when the reset button is released.|$|E
50|$|In the TN-S system, {{separate}} {{neutral and}} protective earth conductors are installed between {{the equipment and}} the source of supply (generator or electric utility transformer). Normal circuit currents flow only in the neutral, and the protective <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> bonds all equipment cases to earth to intercept any leakage current due to insulation failure. The neutral conductor is connected to earth at the building point of supply, but no common path to ground exists for circuit current and the protective conductor.|$|E
30|$|LV {{distribution}} networks {{consist of}} several conductors {{which can be}} simultaneously used to set up multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication links. This strategy is being successfully employed in wireless communications and in indoor BB-PLC [19], where the phase, neutral, and protective <b>earth</b> <b>conductors</b> are used for the MIMO. However, there are almost no available works on NB-PLC MIMO, and they are limited to explore indoor NB-PLC channels [20] or to plain tests using existing single phase PRIME devices [21].|$|R
5000|$|In IT and TN-C networks, {{residual}} current devices {{are far less}} likely to detect an insulation fault. In a TN-C system, they would also be very vulnerable to unwanted triggering from contact between <b>earth</b> <b>conductors</b> of circuits on different RCDs or with real ground, thus making their use impracticable. Also, RCDs usually isolate the neutral core. Since it is unsafe to do this in a TN-C system, RCDs on TN-C should be wired to only interrupt the line conductor.|$|R
50|$|The big {{advantage}} of the TT earthing system is the reduced conducted interference from other users' connected equipment. TT has always been preferable for special applications like telecommunication sites that benefit from the interference-free earthing. Also, TT networks do not pose any serious risks {{in the case of}} a broken neutral. In addition, in locations where power is distributed overhead, <b>earth</b> <b>conductors</b> are not at risk of becoming live should any overhead distribution conductor be fractured by, say, a fallen tree or branch.|$|R
50|$|Thermoplastic-sheathed cable (TPS) {{consists}} of an outer toughened sheath of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (the thermoplastic element) covering one or more individual cables which are PVC insulated annealed copper conductors. It is a commonly used type of wiring for residential and light commercial construction in many countries. The flat version of the cable with two insulated conductors and an uninsulated <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> all within the outer sheath {{is referred to as}} twin and earth. In mainland Europe, a round equivalent is more common.|$|E
5000|$|A {{domestic}} supply typically {{consists of}} a large cable connected to a service head, the sealed box containing the main supply fuse, treated as the supply to the premises. This will typically have a value from 40-100 A. Separate [...] and neutral cables (tails) go from here to an electricity meter, and often an <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> too. More tails proceed from the meter into the consumer side of the installation and into a consumer unit (distribution board), {{or in some cases}} to a Henley block (a splitter box used in low voltage electrical engineering) and thence to more than one distribution board.|$|E
50|$|These {{appliances}} {{must have}} their chassis connected to electrical earth (US: ground) by a separate <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> (coloured green/yellow in most countries, {{green in the}} US, Canada and Japan).The earth connection is achieved with a 3-conductor mains cable, typically ending with 3-prong AC connector which plugs into a corresponding AC outlet. The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that if a fault occurs the supply will be removed automatically (this is {{sometimes referred to as}} ADS = Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E

25|$|Related to this, a single-pole RCD/RCBO {{interrupts}} the energized conductor only, while a double-pole device interrupts {{both the}} energized and return conductors. Usually {{this is a}} standard and safe practice, since the return conductor is held at ground potential anyway. However, because of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the return conductor is not being held, as expected, at ground potential, or where current leakage occurs between the return and <b>earth</b> <b>conductors.</b> In these cases, a double-pole RCD will offer protection, since the return conductor would also be disconnected.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of {{triaxial}} cable is in television {{industry as a}} connecting cable between a camera and its CCU. The outer sheath is commonly used as a protective <b>earth</b> <b>conductor.</b> The core provides both power and signal connections, with the return for the power being provided through the inner screen. Through frequency-division multiplexing, the camera can send audio and video signals along the triax while the CCU can send camera control information, such as exposure settings, intercom, return audio and video (usually that of the program), and tally (a signal alerting the operator that their camera is on the air)and power for the camera.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fault in}} the {{appliance}} which causes a live conductor {{to contact the}} casing will cause a current to flow in the <b>earth</b> <b>conductor.</b> If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker (CB)) and disconnect the supply [...] The disconnection time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start {{if a person is}} in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand and Israel the TN-C-S {{system is}} in use; however, the wiring rules {{currently}} state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth via both a water pipe bond (if metallic water pipes enter the consumer's premises) and a dedicated earth electrode. In Australia and New Zealand {{this is called the}} Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the <b>earth</b> <b>conductor</b> (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms. In older installations, {{it is not uncommon to}} find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done. The protective earth and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) - beyond this point, the protective earth and neutral conductors are separate.|$|E
25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} <b>earthing</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Solenoid {{voltmeters}} draw appreciable current when operating. This {{makes them}} useful for testing residual-current devices (GFCIs) because the current drawn will trip most RCDs when the solenoid voltmeter is connected between the live and <b>earth</b> <b>conductors.</b> Also, when testing power supply circuits, a high-impedance connection (that is, a nearly open-circuit fault {{such as a}} burned switch contact or wire joint) in the power path might still allow enough voltage/current through to register on a high-impedance digital voltmeter, but it probably will not actuate the solenoid voltmeter. For use with high impedance circuit applications, however, they are not so good, as they draw appreciable current and therefore alter the voltage being measured.|$|R
50|$|Air ionisers {{are used}} in air purifiers to remove {{particles}} from air. Airborne particles are attracted to the electrode in an effect similar to static electricity. These ions are de-ionised by seeking <b>earthed</b> <b>conductors,</b> such as walls and ceilings. To increase the efficiency of this process, some commercial products provide such surfaces within the device. The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero, an unexpected result. Positive and negative ions produced by air conditioning systems have also been found by a manufacturer to inactivate viruses including influenza.|$|R
