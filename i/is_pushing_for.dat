25|$|The U.S. Coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> a {{technology}} neutral policy for government subsidies of environmentally friendly automotive technology.

25|$|RIT Public Safety is {{the primary}} agency {{responsible}} for protection of students, staff and property as well as enforcement of both college policies and state laws. Officers are NYS Licensed Security Guards who possess an expanded scope of authority under NYS Education Law, and many Officers have prior law enforcement backgrounds. Rumor has also circulated that the department <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> Peace Officer authority, however no official action has been made at this time. Public Safety Officers operate both a dispatch center and various types of patrol units on campus and at off campus holdings (such as The Inn and Conference Center) and also manage the Call Box System. Activating a call box will automatically place the user in touch with an Officer in the dispatch center who will direct Patrol Officers {{to respond to the}} location; if necessary, Officers will summon the Monroe County Sheriff's to respond as well. As the college does not have 24/7 on campus crisis intervention counselors, {{in the event of a}} mental or behavioral health incident during hours where a counselor is not available, Public Safety Officers are also trained to act as mediators until an on-call counselor can be summoned.|$|E

25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways {{and would like to}} restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP and is willing to go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple of days after presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E

I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

2500|$|Lockheed <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> {{funding for}} the {{development}} of an extended range (ER) version of the THAAD to counter maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low and high-altitude missile defenses. The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current -diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a [...] first stage for greater range with a second [...] "kick stage" [...] to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of early 2015 THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries. If {{funding for the}} THAAD-ER begins in 2018, a system could be produced by 2022 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense; these are expected to become available in the mid to late 2020's.|$|E
