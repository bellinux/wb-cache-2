5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature <b>in</b> <b>Greek</b> under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing <b>in</b> <b>Greek</b> during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among their intended audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature <b>in</b> <b>Greek</b> from this general period.|$|E

5|$|Trilingualism {{was perhaps}} not {{uncommon}} among educated {{people who came}} from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote <b>in</b> <b>Greek,</b> and had learned Punic from his mother. The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These papyri, named for a Jewish woman {{in the province of}} Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written <b>in</b> <b>Greek</b> characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written <b>in</b> <b>Greek.</b>|$|E
