40|$|A {{new type}} {{prosthetic}} prehensor for children aged 4 – 9 has been designed, constructed and build {{in an attempt}} to improve the appearance of the split-hook prosthesis. The new prehensor is a mechanically operated voluntary opening device. All mechanical parts are within the frame, and covered by a polyurethane cosmetic cover, which can be made in almost any color desired. Clinical testing of the prehensor by 4 children with a total time of use of over 170 months, revealed the mechanism to be very robust and reliable. The colorful <b>hook</b> <b>cover</b> is highly appreciated by the children. Encouraged by this success, a second larger size has been made intended for children aged 7 - 14. This medium size prehensor is now in clinical use by 1 child for over 12 months. Again, the appearance of the hook is highly appreciated, and again, the mechanism proves to be very reliable...|$|E

5000|$|Pleats, Puckers and Spurs - A pleat is a {{fold in the}} <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> {{that extends}} from the cut edge {{downward}} toward the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> radius and sometimes below this radius in a sharp vee or spur shape. A pucker is a condition which is intermediate between a reverse wrinkle and a pleat, where the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> at the cut edge is locally distorted downward without actually folding. A spur is a localized irregularity characterized by a sharp protrusion {{at the bottom of}} the double seam. It is usually accompanied by a pleat or vee in the <b>cover</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tight First Operation Seam - Tight first {{operation}} seams {{can create}} flatness {{at the bottom}} of the first operation seam throughout its length.

50|$|The {{seaming head}} then engages the second {{operation}} roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly {{to form the}} final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body <b>Hook,</b> c) <b>Cover</b> <b>Hook,</b> d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|R

40|$|Four-day-old etiolated {{cucumber}} cotyledons (Cucumis sativus, L.) were excised {{and allowed}} to green in white fluorescent light at 28 C. Cotyledons excised with a full hypocotyl hook exhibited a lag phase of 1 hour before entering the rapid greening phase, whereas cotyledons excised without any hypocotyl hook exhibited a lag phase of 6 hours. Cotyledons excised with varying lengths of hypocotyl hook accumulated chlorophyll roughly {{in proportion to the}} hook length. When cotyledons were excised with a full hook and were partially or totally shielded from light with aluminum foil, the samples with the <b>hook</b> <b>covered</b> accumulated more chlorophyll than the wholly exposed samples. The samples with the cotyledons covered showed no net accumulation of chlorophyll irrespective of hook's exposure to light. These data suggest the contribution of some factor or factors by the hypocotyl hook which reduce the lag phase during greening...|$|R

5000|$|False Seam - A [...] "false seam" [...] is a seam or {{portion of}} the seam which is {{completely}} unhooked, and in which the folded <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> is compressed against the folded body hook. A false seam is not always detectable in an external examination.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary hooks are {{manufactured}} from either high-carbon steel, steel alloyed with Vanadium, or stainless steel, depending on application. Most quality fish <b>hooks</b> are <b>covered</b> with {{some form of}} corrosion-resistant surface coating. Corrosion resistance is required not only when hooks are used, especially in saltwater, but while they are stored. Additionally, coatings are applied to color and/or provide aesthetic value to the hook. At a minimum, hooks designed for freshwater use are coated with a clear lacquer, but hooks are also coated with gold, nickel, Teflon, tin and different colors.|$|R

No, honestly." [...] Josh Modell of Spin gave the album {{four out of five}} stars. He said, [...] "For the first time in years, Pearl Jam are seizing the moment rather than wallowing in it." [...] Time reviewer Josh Tyrangiel said, [...] "The songs here are built on <b>hooks,</b> <b>covered</b> with guitar fuzz, and then trimmed back a bit so the melody abides." [...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old feel, if not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|R

5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by tearing down the seam, then measuring the <b>cover</b> <b>hook</b> and body hook parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including false seams).|$|R
5000|$|Hooked is {{the fifth}} {{full-length}} studio album by the American hard rock band Great White, released in 1991. Though lacking a recognizable hit single and not commercially as successful as ...Twice Shy, it still managed to peak at No. 18 on the Billboard 200 album chart and it was critically well received. The album was certified Gold in April 1991. The original album cover art was photographed by famous fashion photographer John Scarpati and featured a nude female model being hoisted {{out of the sea}} by a large <b>hook.</b> This <b>cover</b> was judged too risque by the label and replaced by art director Hugh Syme shortly after the initial pressing with an alternative cover that had the hook still below the sea level and the model partially submerged, so that only her head and arms were visible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kernel rootkits, {{as one of}} {{the most}} elusive types of malware, pose {{significant}} challenges for investigation and defense. Among the most notable are persistent kernel rootkits, a special type of kernel rootkits that implant persistent kernel hooks to tamper with the kernel execution to hide their presence. To defend against them, an effective approach is to first identify those kernel hooks and then protect them from being manipulated by these rootkits. In this paper, we focus on the first step by proposing a systematic approach to identify those kernel hooks. Our approach is based on two key observations: First, rootkits by design will attempt to hide its presence from all running rootkit-detection software including various system utility programs (e. g., ps and ls). Second, to manipulate OS kernel control-flows, persistent kernel rootkits by their nature will implant kernel hooks on the corresponding kernel-side execution paths invoked by the security programs. In other words, for any persistent kernel rootkit, either it is detectable by a security program or it has to tamper with one of the kernel hooks on the corresponding kernel-side execution path(s) of the security program. As a result, given an authentic security program, we only need to monitor and analyze its kernel-side execution paths to identify the related set of kernel hooks that could be potentially hijacked for evasion. We have built a proof-of-concept system called HookMap and evaluated it with a number of Linux utility programs such as ls, ps, and netstat in RedHat Fedora Core 5. Our system found that there exist 35 kernel hooks in the kernel-side execution path of ls that can be potentially hijacked for manipulation (e. g., for hiding files). Similarly, there are 85 kernel hooks for ps and 51 kernel hooks for netstat, which can be respectively hooked for hiding processes and network activities. A manual analysis of eight real-world rootkits shows that our identified kernel <b>hooks</b> <b>cover</b> all those used in them. ...|$|R
