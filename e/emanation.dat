40|$|Abstract — Computer {{equipment}} {{produces a}} wide range of <b>emanations</b> in the visible, electromagnetic, and acoustic spectra. It is well known that electromagnetic <b>emanations</b> can reveal information about the operations being performed by a machine, and it has recently been shown that acoustic <b>emanations</b> can do the same. Additionally, techniques have been developed to manipulate electromagnetic <b>emanations</b> so that they surreptitiously transmit data to a remote receiver. In this paper, we similarly demonstrate how acoustic <b>emanations</b> can be manipulated to transmit arbitrary data and show how this technique can be used to create a practical, software-only acoustic keylogger. Finally, we recommend countermeasures to prevent such an attack from being performed...|$|R

5000|$|In recent years, {{there was}} the {{creation}} of a secretive group named [...] "The Keepers of the Seven Rays". Their philosophy is the human being has seven <b>emanations</b> in which it finds itself, or connects with the Higher Self. These <b>emanations</b> are extensions of the Higher Self or otherwise called the Higher Will. These <b>emanations</b> reach out like arms and grasp onto the knowledge(of all types) needed for the full development of the individual into his/her Higher Potential. All a human has to do to use these <b>emanations</b> is to know basic moral law, what their body and/or psyche can and cannot handle, and listen.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{methods to}} identify, quantify, and use information leaked in Electromagnetic (EM) <b>emanations</b> {{from a broad}} range of computing devices in a general (i. e. not application specific) way by synthesizing techniques from the fields of electromagnetics, computer architecture, and software engineering. Computers emit EM radiation (<b>emanations)</b> as a side effect of the voltage and current variations required to perform computation. Aside from cryptoanalysis, EM <b>emanations</b> provide information about a system's operation that may be useful in other applications. A number of emerging applications make use of EM <b>emanations</b> to extract new types of information from computing devices. For example, EM <b>emanations</b> can be used to determine or verify the execution path through a program for program profiling, debugging, and malware detection. These new applications require a more general approach that can be rapidly and automatically applied to numerous and diverse types of programs and computing devices. This approach requires automatic and systematic identification, quantification, and analysis of information embedded in EM <b>emanations.</b> Toward this goal, our research has developed (1) a methodology for quantifying the side channel signal created by single instruction differences in a computer programs, (2) a method for identifying existing signals within computing devices which are unintentionally amplitude modulated by program activity, (3) a method for profiling computer programs via EM <b>emanations</b> with zero hardware and software overhead, and (4) a method for detecting the presence of unknown code during executions of a known computer program using EM <b>emanations</b> alone at a distance of 3 meters.

Then these sutras may be properly regarded as the words of the Buddha (Skt. buddhavacana).|$|E

25|$|Though some {{scholars}} claim that in 1949 Sivatte was also expulsed from Carlism, other authors maintain that he voluntarily separated {{himself from the}} organization. As he {{was followed by a}} number of collaborators, the mainstream Catalan Carlism was forced into a minority position. The breakup was best demonstrated by two Aplecs de Montserrat, since 1949 organized each year separately by the Javieristas and by the Sivattistas. The latter did not assume a formal shape and remained a loose group; their organizational <b>emanation</b> was Centro Familiar Montserrat, functioning as a social circulo rather than as a political body.|$|E
25|$|Historically, however, Gnostic Christianity did not portray Jesus {{as merely}} human. In fact, the Gnostic Jesus was less human than the Jesus of {{orthodox}} Christianity. While orthodox Christianity generally considered Christ both divine and human, many Gnostic sects considered Christ purely divine, his human body being a mere illusion (see Docetism). Many Gnostics saw matter as evil, {{and believed that}} a divine spirit would never have taken on a material body. Some varieties of Gnosticism {{went so far as}} to hold that the God of the Jews is only a demiurge who has trapped humanity in a fleshly prison; and that Christ is an <b>emanation</b> of the true God, sent to free humanity from that bondage to the flesh. (See Marcionism, Aeon, Archon).|$|E
25|$|The first <b>emanation</b> is Nous (Divine Mind, Logos, Order, Thought, Reason), {{identified}} metaphorically {{with the}} Demiurge in Plato's Timaeus. It {{is the first}} Will toward Good. From Nous proceeds the World Soul, which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with nature. From the world soul proceeds individual human souls, and finally, matter, at {{the lowest level of}} being and thus the least perfected level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of nous and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the Forms.|$|E

25|$|In the Umm al-kitab, Azazel is {{the first}} <b>emanation</b> of the high king (original God) and loaned the power of {{creation}} from the true God. Therefore he claimed to be an independent God, besides the high king. After that, the high king made a new creation which exceeded the creatures of Azazel. After he remains refusing to confess {{to be just a}} creature, emanated from the true God, he is banished into lower spheres. Every time he refuses again to accept the new creation Salman, he is banished again into lower regions, until he reaches the earth. The earth is according to the Umm al-kitab created out of the essence of Azazels creation, while humans and lifeforce originated from the heavenly realm. Since Azazel is banished into the material world, he seduces the humans, leads them into his realm and tries to keep human trapped in there. He resembles to the gnostic demiurge.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Rushd (Averroës), the {{contemporary}} of Maimonides, closed {{the first great}} philosophical era of the Muslims. He was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Averroes' philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Ibn Rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal <b>emanation,</b> through which motion is communicated {{from place to place}} to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme worldhypotheses which, {{in the mind of the}} Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. His ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion, further developed by the Averroist school of philosophy, were later influential in the development of modern secularism.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{previous}} Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity Vajrayogini at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini appeared out of {{the face of the}} rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When he asked if there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and {{down the length of the}} dried blades of grass. This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the <b>emanation</b> of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the Kings of Shambhala as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.|$|E
