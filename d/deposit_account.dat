25|$|In most legal systems, a {{bank deposit}} {{is not a}} bailment. In other words, the funds {{deposited}} {{are no longer the}} property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a <b>deposit</b> <b>account</b> (a checking or savings account). That <b>deposit</b> <b>account</b> is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E

30|$|While the {{presence}} of banks {{may be seen as}} a benchmark of financial development, the types of services banks offer may also be important. There are four types of accounts offered by banks in this study: checking <b>accounts,</b> time <b>deposit</b> <b>accounts,</b> demand <b>deposit</b> savings <b>accounts,</b> and credit card accounts.

25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a <b>deposit</b> <b>account</b> owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E
