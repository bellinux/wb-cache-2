500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating, saying, [...] "We're not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{after the}} release of Juiced, Mark McGwire was among 11 Major League Baseball players that were {{publicly}} addressed concerning their use of steroids. During the accusations McGwire was noted for avoiding direct questions from Congress, instead continually saying [...] "I'm not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past." [...] Although he never admitted to steroid use, the public certainly questioned {{whether or not he was}} a user because of his unwillingness to answer direct questions. McGwire was never officially identified as a steroid user, however his public image suffered after he failed to respond to these accusations.|$|E
2500|$|Many top players, {{including}} Canseco, Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Curt Schilling were summoned on March 17, 2005 {{to testify}} in front of Congress (Schilling was summoned because of his outspoken opposition {{to the use of}} PEDs). [...] During the session, Canseco admitted his steroid use which he claims was perfectly acceptable during the 1980s and early 90's. [...] Palmeiro denied all steroid use during his career, while McGwire refused to discuss the issue, contending that he would be considered guilty no matter what he said. His repeated statement [...] "I'm not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past," [...] became the most highlighted moment of the proceedings.|$|E

I {{want you to know}} me for who I truly am." [...] He mentioned President Clinton only once near the beginning of the speech. The speech was focused on issues: [...] "I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously <b>about</b> the issues. I believe people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.

40|$|I am <b>here</b> today <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the}} {{security}} implications of Radio Frequency Identification. RFID tags are remotely-powered data carriers that resemble the theft control tags that you might find in a sweater when buying clothing from a store. Like theft-control tags, RFID tags are powered and accessed from a distance using radio waves, but RFID tags differ from theft-control tags in {{that they tend to}} have more storage space and processing power. RFID tags have security issues that have been exposed in the past few years. The heart {{of the problem is that}} RFID tags don’t usually support cryptography, plus RFID application scenarios are usually not conducive to commonly performed security operations like key management; in fact, many security and privacy issues that generally exist in ubiquitous computing reappear in RFID applications specifically...|$|R

Of course, as I said before, it might appear that I have no right to meddle with your family affairs, but in this case I certainly think I am justified; for, as Mrs. Easterfield invited the young lady to leave you and to come to her, and as all that has happened to her has happened at our house, and in consequence of that invitation, I think that you, as her nearest accessible relative, should be told of what has occurred." ...|$|R

40|$|I {{was invited}} <b>here</b> <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> transducers, and I 2 ̆ 7 d {{like to tell}} you how that came about. It came about because the General Electric Jet Engine Dept. has been trying to perform water {{immersion}} ultrasonic inspection of engine forgings with commercially available inspection equipment and has found that this equipment is ill suited to the task. I would guess that most of these instruments were designed 5 or 10 years ago for applications in the steel industry. In any case, they do not have enough dynamic range to accommodate the large acoustic attenuation encountered in Jet Engine alloys, and they do not have adequate resolution. But above all, it seems to be impossible to purchase reliable transducers whose characteristics are reproducible and well specified...|$|R

6000|$|Not so the Philosophical Society of the Midlands. The {{chairman}} rises. He doesn't {{call for}} silence. It is there, thick.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Cothran {{was arrested}} for gun {{possession}} while driving a stolen car with several friends.

You could be respected. You could be honored. You could feel that you had actually done something that made a difference. I {{want to tell you that}} is why I was in love with mediation. Thirteen years later, it has been a struggle for me to hold on to those feelings. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> that journey because we never <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it.
