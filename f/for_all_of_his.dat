5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose {{to the position of}} a military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China.

A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E

Belcourt described the original territory of the Chippewa in the Pembina district as several hundred miles north to south, and east to west - {{much larger than the}} small reservation to which they were later assigned.|$|E
