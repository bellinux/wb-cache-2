40|$|The {{creation}} of digital libraries for <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> {{opens up a}} very promising new field for university libraries. Although <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> are documents of great importance for researchers, they have traditionally suffered from a problem of accessibility, which the new digital libraries {{are now beginning to}} solve. However, the development of digital libraries in general and of those for <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> in particular is still incipient. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a methodology for their organisation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> based on sex of supervisors year periods {{and universities in}} which have a sociology PhD program in Turkey and also it determines whether there are any significant differences according to those variables. Currently, Turkey has 169 universities that 63 of those have been admitting students for undergraduate program of sociology departments. In addition, 25 universities have doctoral program at sociology. However, <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> have been conducted only in 14 universities among them. Totally 513 <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> were found which were conducted between 1950 and 2012. In this study only 493 <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations,</b> out of 513, were analyzed. The qualitative and quantitative context analyze has been applied from the socio-historical critique point of view by using MAXQDA. Consequently, this study indicates that there is gender-related differentiation of doctoral dissertations’ supervisors based on years and universities that <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> were conducted in departments of sociology...|$|R

40|$|Aim/Purpose: We show a new {{dimension}} to the process of using design-based research approach in <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations.</b> Background:	Design-based research is a long-term and concentrated approach to educational inquiry. It is often a recommendation that doctoral students should not attempt to adopt this approach for their <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations.</b> In this paper, we document two <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> that used a design-based research approach in two different contexts. Methodology	: The study draws on a qualitative analysis of the methodological approaches of two <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> through the lenses of Herrington, McKenney, Reeves and Oliver principles of design-based research approach. Contribution: The findings of this study add a {{new dimension}} to using design-based research approach in <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations</b> in shorter-term and less intensive contexts. Findings: The results {{of this study indicate that}} design-based research is not only an effective methodological approach in <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations,</b> but it also has the potential to guide future research direction beyond examination. Recommendations for Practitioners	: The findings of this study demonstrate that the design based research approach could bring researchers and practitioners together regarding a common purpose to design context-based solutions to educational problems. Impact on Society: We show an alternative view and application of design-based research in <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertations.</b> Also, we identify the benefits of this type of research for doctoral students after completing their dissertations...|$|R

5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation,</b> a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation,</b> Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation.</b> Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation</b> and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, {{in sharp contrast to}} the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his <b>doctoral</b> <b>dissertation,</b> he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E

In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the North Star School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at North Star until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville-Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his {{three years in the}} district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director.

Also during this time, he met the renowned North American sociologist, Dennis Wrong. Their meeting motivated Goffman to leave the University of Manitoba and enroll at the University of Toronto, where he studied under C. W. M. Hart and Ray Birdwhistell, graduating in 1945 with a BA in sociology and anthropology. Later he moved to the University of Chicago, where he received an MA (1949) and PhD (1953) in sociology.
