5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint,</b> misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Dodd {{oversaw the}} {{integration}} of Georgia Tech football team as Athletic Director. Eddie McAshan was the first African American football player to start for Georgia Tech. Bud Carson started McAshan in 1970 at quarterback as a sophomore and McAshan {{would go on to}} set several career records for Georgia Tech (which have since been broken by Shawn Jones and Joe Hamilton). McAshan's first career start was on September 12, 1970 against South Carolina. His start marked the first time that an African American had ever started at quarterback for a major Southeastern university and McAshan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint.</b> He rallied Tech with a fourth quarter deficit, defeating the Gamecocks 23-20 with two late touchdown drives. McAshan threw for 32 touchdowns during his college football career, and Georgia Tech had 22-13-1 record during that time frame.|$|E

25|$|Before the game, Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson famously {{guaranteed}} {{that his team}} would win, and his team <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint.</b> The Cowboys jumped to a 28–7 halftime lead, racking up 273 yards and 19 first downs, and scoring four touchdowns in their first five possessions. San Francisco finished the half with just 110 total yards and six first downs.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{opportunity}} to break back into the international side arose when Geoffrey Boycott was injured during Australia's tour of England in 1964. Edrich was called up to the side for the Second Test, at Lord's, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint,</b> scoring 120. The match ended in a draw due to rain. However, he was not selected for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch {{made his}} first start with McHenry at the {{racetrack}} in Windsor, Ontario on July 10 in a race for 2:15 level pacers.

25|$|The enemy, as it happened, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint</b> him.

25|$|After three {{extremely}} prolific seasons, Turner {{could not}} maintain his productivity.

However, still regarded as the best bowler for English conditions, Turner <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint</b> the selectors in 1890, taking 179 first-class wickets (215 in all games) but being unable to break England's dominance of Test cricket at the time.|$|E

He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright.|$|E

25|$|In August 1958, {{during a}} chance {{meeting at the}} Nock and Kirbys record bar with already {{established}} R'Jays band foundation members, drummer Barry Lewis and guitarist Jon Hayton, Richards was offered the spot, untested, as The R'Jays lead singer. This meeting was fortuitous for all, as the band had already booked a venue for a dance night in two weeks time and unfortunately their then singer {{had turned out to}} be somewhat average and had departed the scene.

It was not the most glamorous of centuries, but filled the young batsman with the confidence he needed to secure his place in the team for much of the next decade. Jones and Taylor batted throughout the morning taking Australia to 273 for 4 when Taylor was finally dismissed for 136.|$|E

25|$|Gáborík {{got off to}} a {{quick start}} with his new club, scoring 10 goals in his first 12 games. Nearly a month into the season, he {{suffered}} a knee injury after colliding with former Ranger Petr Průcha in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on 26 October 2009. He missed two games, including what would have been his first game back in Minnesota against the Wild. Gáborík was injured for a second time in the season when his right leg was cut by team goaltender Henrik Lundqvist during a team practice on 9 February 2010. Though the Rangers missed the 2010 playoffs, Gáborík <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint</b> in his first season with the team; he played in 76 games, matching his career high with 42 goals, and set a new career high in points with 86.|$|E
25|$|Neuer {{played for}} Schalke 04 II during the 2003–04, 2004–05, 2006–07, and 2008–09.

He made his Bundesliga debut with Schalke {{when he came}} on to substitute the injured Frank Rost on matchday 2 of the 2006–07 season.

25|$|Wattles began {{training}} Dan Patch {{in earnest}} at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before {{his first start}} in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and Wattles with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who {{did not seem to}} be working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was no better than the next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>disappoint,</b> winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. Wattles had not pushed the colt, wanting to be able to stay at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.|$|E
