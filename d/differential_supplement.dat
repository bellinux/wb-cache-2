The dynamics {{is that of a}} massless body moving in a central gravitational force field subject also to a drag and a radial modulated force.

For photoacoustic cells, an alternative procedure has been used for the calculation of the photoacoustic signal of cylinder shaped cells.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the third and last of a series seeking to {{shed some light on}} the {{question}} of whether a nation's urban population grows mostly by rural-urban migration or by natural increase. Again, the discussion evolves around an analytical study of the Keyfitz model of urbanization (Keyfitz, 1978) and the Rogers components-of-change model (Rogers, 1968) applied to a rural-urban system. Here, in contrast to the preceding papers in which rates of natural increase and migration were constant, the present paper allows these rates to vary. A larger part of the analysis is based on the Keyfitz model, shown earlier to be less meaningful than the alternative model but lending itself to an easier tractability when rates are allowed to vary. In particular, the Keyfitz model is used in an attempt to connect the variations of rural-urban (net) migration rates to economic changes through a simple scheme of wage <b>differentials,</b> later <b>supplemented</b> by the Todaro hypothesis...|$|R

Precisely, Section  3 contains some existence results for problem (1.1)-(1.2): the first one (Theorem  3.2) deals with nonconvex valued maps (the Lipschitz case) and is obtained by applying a fixed point theorem for multivalued maps due to Covitz and Nadler; the second result (Theorem  3.3) {{takes into account the}} convex-valued maps (the upper semicontinuous case) and relies on nonlinear alternative of Leray-Schauder type; and the third one (Theorem  3.4) involves multivalued maps which are not necessarily convex-valued (the lower semicontinuous case) and is obtained by jointly using the nonlinear alternative of Leray-Schauder type and the selection theorem of Bressan and Colombo [37] for lower semicontinuous maps with decomposable values. These results have been illustrated with the aid of examples in Section  4. Finally, we have provided the platform for proving the existence results for problem (1.1)-(1.3).

Based on standard fixed-point theorems for multivalued maps, Ahmad et al.

This approach relies on a basic positive feedback mechanism that reinforces {{the ability of a}} given individual to win or to lose in a hierarchical interaction, depending on how many times it won or lost in previous interactions.

Numerical integrations allow many different hierarchical profiles to be obtained depending on the model parameters: (1) the particular form of the probability for an individual to win or lose a fight given its history, (2) the probability of interaction between two individuals, (3) the forgetting strength, which determines the rate at which events in the past are forgotten and no longer influence the force of an individual and (4) two individual recognition parameters, which set the contribution of individual recognition in the process of hierarchical genesis.

An example of this construction is given {{in the case of}} a closed Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker universe. Eventually, once a solution for trK is obtained, the induced metric and the trace-free part σ of K obey a coupled first-order system where the only residual source of nonlinearity is a term quadratic in σ in a second-order operator of Laplace type. 1 The canonical formulation of general relativity relies on the assumption that spacetime (M, g) is topologically Σ ×R and can be foliated by a family of spacelike surfaces Σt, all diffeomorphic to the three-manifold Σ. The space-time metric g is then locally cast in the form g = −(N 2 − NiN i) dt ⊗ dt + Ni(dx i ⊗ dt + dt ⊗ dx i) + hijdx i ⊗ dx j, (1) where N is the lapse function and N i are components of the shift vector of the foliation [1 – 3]. The induced metric hij on Σt and the associated extrinsic-curvature tensor Kij turn out to obey the first-order equations [1 – 3] ∂hij ∂t = − 2 NKij + N i|j + N j|i, (2...|$|R
