25|$|Distribution {{power systems}} may be solidly grounded, with one circuit {{conductor}} {{directly connected to}} an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of electrical impedance may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a high-impedance grounded system, the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> {{is limited to a}} few amperes (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred amperes to flow on a fault.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Superconducting fault-current {{limiters}} (SFCLs) {{have been}} the subject of research and development for many years and offer an attractive solution to the problem of rising fault levels in electrical distribution systems. SFCLs can greatly reduce <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> and the damage at the point of fault, and help improve the stability of a power system. The resistance of an SFCL should be chosen to limit <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> as much as possible. Not only does this benefit an electrical system through reduction in the potentially damaging effects of high <b>fault</b> <b>currents,</b> which is the primary purpose of the SFCL, but increasing the limitation of <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> also has a consequence of shortening the recovery time of the SFCL by reducing the energy dissipated in the resistance of the SFCL. Superconducting fault-current limiters (SFCL) provide a new efficient approach to the reliable handling of such faults. (SCFLs) can be used for various nominal voltages and currents, and can be adapted to particular limiting characteristics in case of short circuits. Electrical equipment that controls high <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> can increase the security of the network and allow power equipment to be designed more cost effectively. SFCL allows electrical interconnections of existing systems, which would not be possible without limiters. Finally, the SFCL is introduced in the higher capacity system. Thus, it is revealed that the outstanding current limiting performance of SFCL can be used to limit the fault to the level of the existing switchgear...|$|R

However, superconductivity {{is sensitive to}} moving magnetic fields so applications that use alternating current (e.g. transformers) {{will be more difficult}} to develop than those that rely upon direct current. Compared to traditional power lines superconducting transmission lines are more efficient and require {{only a fraction of the}} space, which would not only lead to a better environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion of the electric grid.|$|E
25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E
25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the best way to handle the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for <b>fault</b> <b>current,</b> potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Downed conductors, tree {{branches}} touching conductors, and failing insulators often cause high-impedance faults in overhead distribution systems. The <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> of these <b>faults</b> are {{much smaller than}} detection thresholds of traditional ground fault detection devices, so reliable detection of these highimpedance faults is challenging. Although <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> can be much smaller in ungrounded systems than <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> in multigrounded systems given similar fault conditions, fault detection for ungrounded systems is nevertheless easier. This paper contrasts the differences between high-impedance fault detections for ungrounded and multigrounded systems.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a wavelet based algorithm, for distinguishing between magnetizing inrush currents and power system <b>fault</b> <b>currents,</b> which is quite adequate, reliable, fast and computationally efficient tool. The proposed technique consists of a preprocessing unit based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in combination with an artificial neural network (ANN) for detecting and classifying <b>fault</b> <b>currents.</b> The DWT acts as an extractor of distinctive features in the input signals at the relay location. This information is then fed into an ANN for classifying fault and magnetizing inrush conditions.

Operation {{does not require a}} <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> to return through the earth wire in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|E

[...] This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> which arises from a short-circuit between {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|E
