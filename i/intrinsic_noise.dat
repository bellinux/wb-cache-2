25|$|For high-intensity {{continuous}} wave (CW) lasers, SRS {{can be used}} to produce broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>noise</b> due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.|$|E

This is particularly advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes the vital interplay of time and space.

5000|$|The linear noise {{approximation}} {{has become}} a popular technique for estimating the size of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>noise</b> in terms of coefficients of variation and Fano factors for molecular species in intracellular pathways. The second moment obtained from the linear noise approximation (on which the noise measures are based) are exact only if the pathway is composed of first-order reactions. However bimolecular reactions such as enzyme-substrate, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are ubiquitous elements of all known pathways; for such cases, the linear noise approximation can give estimates which are accurate {{in the limit of}} large reaction volumes. Since this limit is taken at constant concentrations, it follows that the linear noise approximation gives accurate results in the limit of large molecule numbers and becomes less reliable for pathways characterized by many species with low copy numbers of molecules.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} studies have elucidated cases of the {{insufficiency}} of the linear noise approximation in biological contexts by comparison of its predictions with those of stochastic simulations. This has led to the investigation of higher order terms of the system size expansion that go beyond the linear approximation. These terms have been used to obtain more accurate moment estimates for the mean concentrations and for the variances of the concentration fluctuations in intracellular pathways. In particular, the leading order corrections to the linear noise approximation yield corrections of the conventional rate equations. Terms of higher order have also been used to obtain corrections to the variances and covariances estimates of the linear noise approximation. The linear noise approximation and corrections to it can be computed using the open source software <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Noise</b> Analyzer. The corrections {{have been shown to be}} particularly considerable for allosteric and non-allosteric enzyme-mediated reactions in intracellular compartments.|$|E

5000|$|Developmental noise {{may help}} {{individuals}} gain {{the ability to}} adapt to the environment. Biological systems display both variation and robustness. Natural variation within a population is in large part genetically determined, but variation due to noise may contribute to a rapid response by an individual to changes in the environment. This variation can have an evolutionary tuning effect that contributes to the optimal fitness of a population. In support of this idea, {{it has been shown that}} bacteria can switch stochastically into a [...] "persistent" [...] state which has slow growth coupled with an ability to survive antibiotic treatment. In another study, it has been shown that most of the noisy proteins were associated with the stress response. When proteins are expressed in small quantities, the expression of more noisy proteins will be more influenced by noises which come from the environmental context. Types of noises include extrinsic noise which is the variation in cell-to-cell expression level of protein, and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>noise</b> which is the variation of the inherent stochastic nature of protein expression. Moreover, noisy genes are associated with a distinct promoter architecture, including the prevalence of TATA boxes, consistent with the theoretical predictions that noise is greatly inﬂuenced by the logic of the transcriptional process itself and, in particular, the transition from closed to open chromatin.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>intrinsic</b> channel <b>noise</b> is {{investigated}} for the dynamic response of a neuronal cell with a delayed feedback loop. The loop {{is based on}} the so-called autapse phenomenon in which dendrites establish not only connections to neighboring cells but as well to its own axon. The biophysical modeling is achieved in terms of a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model containing such a built in delayed feedback.

The influence of the delayed stimulus is systematically analyzed with respect to the coupling parameter and the delay time in terms of the interspike interval histograms and the average interspike interval. The delayed feedback manifests itself in the occurrence of bursting and a rich multimodal interspike interval distribution, exhibiting a delay-induced reduction of the spontaneous spiking activity at characteristic frequencies. Moreover, a specific frequency-locking mechanism is detected for the mean interspike interval. Comment: 8 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
