5000|$|Although {{the content}} can be read, the often very {{extensive}} <b>formatting</b> <b>code</b> {{makes it hard}} to read. The files produced by most programs, such as Microsoft Word, contain large amounts of <b>formatting</b> <b>code.</b> Such files are easily ten or more times larger than the corresponding plain text. They are not legible. [...] Also, non-ASCII characters must be escaped in standard-compliant RTF. Thus, even with concise formatting, text that uses certain dashes and quotation marks is less legible. Latin languages that make heavy use of characters with diacritics, such as \'f1 for ñ and \'e9 for é are particularly difficult to read in RTF. Non-Latin scripts, consisting of characters such as \u21563 for 吻, areillegible in RTF. Finally, from its beginnings, RTF has supported Microsoft OLE embedded objects and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects, which are not human-readable.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike many word {{processing}} formats, RTF code can be human-readable: when an RTF file {{is viewed as}} a plain text file, the contained ASCII text is legible.

At the time of RTF's initial release, this was rare among document formats. Today, XML-based formats, which are human-readable, are more common. In contrast, MS Word's [...] format is binary, with only a few scraps of legible text.|$|E

40|$|The World Wide Web is {{the most}} {{increasingly}} growing and accessible source of information. Web contents of different fields which can offer important information to users {{are available in the}} Web like multimedia data, structured, semistructured and unstructured data. But only a part of the information is useful for a particular application and the remaining information are considered as noises. Data on web pages contain <b>formatting</b> <b>code,</b> advertisement, navigation links, etc. This collection of unwanted noise with the real content in a web page complicates the task of automatic information extraction and processing. This requires the extraction of useful noise-free information. Otherwise, it can ruin the effectiveness of Web mining techniques. This paper proposes a novel method to filter web pages and retrieve the actual content of a web page. This research work proposed an approach for removing the noises from a given web page which will improve the performance of web content mining. At first, the web page information is divided into various blocks which then tokenized to separate the informative content from noises. This paper presents algorithm for removing noises from the web page and automatically extract important web content. This paper also presents the algorithm for global noise removal...|$|E
40|$|The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) {{has been}} the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) {{published}} standard for text interchange for nearly a decade. Since 1986, SGML based publishing has been successfully implemented in many fields, notably those industries with massive and mission-critical publishing operations such as the military, legal, medical, and heavy industries. SGML based publishing differs from the WYSIWYG paradigm of desktop publishing in that an SGML document contains descriptive, structural markup rather than specific formatting markup. Specific markup describes {{the appearance of a}} document and is usually a proprietary code which makes the document difficult to re-use or interchange to different systems. The structurally generic markup codes in an SGML document allow the fullest exploitation of the information. An SGML document exhibits more re-usability than a document created and stored in a proprietary <b>formatting</b> <b>code.</b> In many cases, workflow and production are greatly improved by the implementation of SGML based publishing. Historical and anecdotal case studies of many applications clearly delineate the benefits of an SGML based publishing system. And certainly, the boom in Web publishing has spurred interest in enabling a publishing system with multi-output functionality. However, implementation is associated with high costs. The acquisition of new tools and new skills is a costly investment. A careful cost-benefit analysis must determine that the current publishing needs would be satisfied by moving to SGML. Increased productivity is the measure by which SGML is adopted. The purpose of this thesis project is to investigate the relative benefits and requirements of a simple SGML based publishing implementation. The graduate thesis for most of the School of Printing Management and Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology was used as an example. The author has expanded the requirements for the publication process of a graduate thesis with factors which do not exist in reality. The required output has been expanded from mere print output to include publishing on the World Wide Web (WWW) in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and to some proprietary electronic browser such as Folio Views for inclusion in a searchable collection of graduate theses on CD-ROM. A proposed set of tools and methods are discussed in order to clarify the requirements of such an SGML implementation...|$|E
