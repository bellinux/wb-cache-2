5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the <b>holding</b> <b>system,</b> Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E

Burger King was also tinkering with its menu in regards to other products, adding the Griller and a new veggie burger sandwich along with changes to its grilled chicken offerings, onion rings and milkshakes. The company had high hopes for the product at the time of introduction; same store sales for the company had been falling for at least five years resulting in lagging market share and decreased customer counts. The failure of the product left a hole in the company's menu, leaving it without the premium product side of its barbell strategy at a point where parent Diageo was trying to build up the chain's value to maximize the profit in the upcoming sales to the Texas Pacific Group. This failure was part of a series of events that deteriorated the chain's financial performance and eventually forced Diageo to drop its selling price for the chain from [...] to [...]|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces the}} concept of a bus <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> that is based on headways of arriving trains in an effort to improve rail-to-bus transfer connectivity through a simple-to-implement, low-cost dispatching strategy. An analytical model and a simulation model are developed to analyze the impacts of the proposed headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> on total passenger wait time and other relevant measures of transfer performance. The application of the two models to the cases of Alewife and Wellington Stations in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) system and to 79 Street Station in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system shows that the headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> can produce substantial passenger wait time savings if implemented in an appropriate setting. Throughout these analyses, the sensitivity of the headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> to various factors is analyzed, and the results obtained with the headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> are compared with those obtained from the application of other bus dispatching strategies, most notably the strategy of holding each departing bus for passengers transferring from the next train arrival. (cont.) Based on the case study results and sensitivity analyses, a set of guidelines for the implementation of headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>systems</b> is proposed. In. the comparison of the headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> and the hold-all-buses strategy, it is shown that the headway-based <b>hold</b> light <b>system</b> is superior when a large number of downstream boardings occur, due to its tendency to avoid holding bus trips with very few transferring passengers but many downstream passengers. by Andrew T.
