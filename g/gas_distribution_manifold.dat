40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Glow discharge sputtering {{has been used for}} many years to produce thin films but its commercial applications are severely limited by low deposit ion rates. The DC planar magnetron, developed a decade ago, allows much higher deposition rates and its commercial use has expanded rapidly. Non-reactive magnetron sputtering of metallic thin films is well understood and utilized. However when a reactive gas is introduced the process becomes harder to control and can switch between two stable modes. Often films are produced simply by using one of these stable modes even though this does not lead to optimum film properties or high deposition rates. This work gives a model of reactive magnetron sputtering and verifies experimentally its predictions. A 0. 5 m long magnetron was designed and built specifically to allow reactive sputtering onto A 4 rigid substrates. This magnetron has a variable magnetic field distribution which allows plasma bombardment of the substrate during film growth. This was shown to activate reactions at the substrate. The target lifetime was extended in our design by broadening the erosion zone and increasing the target thickness. The reactive sputtering process was shown to be inherently unstable and a control system was designed to maintain the magnetron in an unstable state. Light emission by the plasma at metal line emission wavelengths changes across the instability and so with this control signal a feedback system was built. The accuracy of control was shown experimentally and theoretically to depend on the delay time between measurement, action and effect. In practice this delay was limited by the time constant of the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold.</b> The time constant of such manifolds was measured and calculated. Using our controller high quality films were produced at high rates in normally unstable deposition systems. Conducting indium oxide was produced at 6 nm/s with a resistivity of 6 x 10 - 6 ohm. metres onto A 4 glass sheets. Tin oxide was produced at increased rates onto 2. 5 m by 3 m substrates...|$|E
40|$|Microfabrication {{technology}} {{presents the}} opportunity to create highly instrumented, micro-scale chemical reactors that bring with them the potential for new analytical capabilities, point-of-use synthesis, and highly parallel screening methods. However, the use of integrated circuit-like reaction devices, such as the MIT thin-film microreactor, also {{gives rise to a}} spectrum of new engineering challenges with respect to reactor system integration and scale-up schemes. This work demonstrates the integration of multiple microreactors operating in parallel within a system that includes gas flow control components and the associated electronic circuitry. The system built is equivalent to a conventional laboratory reactor system but in 1 / 10 th of the space. Fluidic and electronic interfaces, thermal management, and operational safety are all considerations in microreactor packaging. A standard microchip socket from Texas Instruments was selected as the first level packaging. The sockets have mechanical attributes that lend them to, with minor reworking, simultaneous fluidic and electronic connection. This selection makes PC board mounting of the reactor devices straightforward. Shut-off microvalves and proportional microvalves from Redwood Microsystems, with their control electronics, have also been mounted on PC boards to control the gas flow in the system. This allows the entire system: reactors, device electronics, and <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold</b> to be mounted on standard CompactPCI cards and housed in a commercially available chassis. A Kaparel CompactPCI chassis is used to house the microreactor system. Electrical connections between the boards are achieved through a standard backplane and custom-built rear I/O PC boards. The system is comprised of a temperature controller card that regulates temperature for auxiliary heaters in the system; a gas mixing board that mixes the feed gas for the microreactors; two microreactor boards that each contain two microreactors with their feed flow controllers; and two heater circuit boards that provide power to the microreactor heaters. A National Instruments embedded real time processor is used to provide closed-loop control and monitor system alarms. A host PC, running LabVIEW 6, is used as the human machine interface for operator interaction and historical data logging. by David J. Quiram. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In {{the past}} six months, this project was focused on more {{fundamental}} studies of the coating properties. The properties of each individual coating TiB{sub 2 }, TiBC {{as well as the}} alternating TiB{sub 2 }/TiBC laminates were studied. These properties include residual stress, surface morphology and topography, adhesion and wear rate. The coatings were deposited using dc magnetron reactive sputtering process. Deposition of the films was carried out in a production-scale, three-chamber-in-line coating system, consisting of a load-lock chamber, and two deposition chambers. The substrates were cleaned and mounted on a rack before going into the chamber. A computerized conveyor system transported the rack into the load-lock chamber, where the pressure was pumped down to around 2 E- 5 torr. The substrates were then preheated by an infrared heater to about 100 C. After preheating, the substrates were transported into the first deposition chamber through a gate valve. The base pressure of the deposition chambers is 2 E- 6 torr. A layer of Ti was deposited on the substrates using two 5 inch x 20 inch Ti targets in the first deposition chamber as the adhesion layer. The substrates were then transported to the second deposition chamber for the TiB{sub 2 } and Ti-B-C-N depositions. In the second deposition chamber, two 5 inch x 20 inch TiB{sub 2 } targets were mounted on both sides. For the TiB{sub 2 } deposition, argon was introduced into the chamber. For the Ti-B-C-N deposition, acetylene and nitrogen were introduced into the chamber through four <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>manifolds</b> to insure the uniformity.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of creating a two dimensional spatial representation of <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> with a mobile robot. In contrast to previous approaches {{to the problem of}} <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> mapping (GDM) we do not assume that the robot has perfect knowledge about its position. Instead we develop a probabilistic framework for simultaneous localisation and occupancy and <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> mapping (GDM-SLAM) that allows to account for the uncertainty about the robot’s position when computing the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> map. Considering the peculiarities of gas sensing in real-world environments, we show which dependencies in the posterior over occupancy and <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> maps can be neglected under certain practical assumptions. We develop a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter formulation of the GDM-SLAM problem that allows to plug in any algorithm to compute a <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> map from a sequence of gas sensor measurements and a known trajectory.

40|$|To study gas dispersion, several {{statistical}} <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling {{approaches have}} been proposed recently. A crucial assumption in these approaches is that <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> models are learned from measurements that are generated by a time-invariant random process. While a time-independent random process can capture certain fluctuations in the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution,</b> more accurate models {{can be obtained by}} modelling changes in the random process over time. In this work we propose a time-scale parameter that relates the age of measurements to their validity for building the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> model in a recency function. The parameters of the recency function define a time-scale and can be learned. The time-scale represents a compromise between two conflicting requirements for obtaining accurate <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> models: using as many measurements as possible and using only very recent measurements. We have studied several recency functions in a time-dependent extension of the Kernel DM+V algorithm (TD Kernel DM+V). Based on real-world experiments and simulations of gas dispersal (presented in this paper) we demonstrate that TD Kernel DM+V improves the obtained <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> models in dynamic situations.

40|$|Presently, no uniform {{methodology}} of identification of optimal costs of construction of <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> networks is available. The amount of work, and, hence, its cost, are identified empirically; therefore, they are insufficiently substantiated by feasibility studies. At best, {{the problem of}} optimization is reduced to simple examination of various options. The problem to be resolved by the method of search optimization may be stated in the following manner: Two consumers are to obtain access to the gas supply. Their positions in the arbitrary coordinate system are available (;). The high pressure <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> line of a <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network is located at {{some distance from the}} aforementioned consumers. It can be represented as follows: = +. Gas control unit installation is required to assure gas pressure reduction. Goal 1 : positioning of a gas control unit to assure the lowest possible cost of the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network construction. Goal 2 : solution to the above problem turns more complicated, if the line of the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network required to connect the designed gas pipeline extension is long. In this case, besides the identification of the optimal coordinates of a gas control unit, it is also necessary to find the point of connection to the gas control unit, for the cost of the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> network to be as low as possible. Goal 3 : some sections of <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> networks pass through or over natural or artificial barriers.

40|$|In the {{changing}} Dutch energy market, the ageing <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> grid needs investments. There is, however, a large uncertainty regarding certain aspects {{that affect the}} future role of this <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> grid, such as the eventual share of biomethane in the gas mix, whether power-to-gas will take-off and the expected lifetime of the grid. Hence, it is currently unclear what investments {{need to be made}} for the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> infrastructure in order to cope with future changes. To find out how the future may unfold for the Dutch <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> infrastructure in 2050, four scenarios have been developed. Two key forces – a key force is a factor that has a large impact on the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> grid but great uncertainty exists regarding its outcome – were chosen, namely “perceived energy resource scarcity” and “willingness and ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. Each scenario sketches the future Dutch gas infrastructure by defining, among others, the extent to which biomass will be used to produce biomethane, whether fossil fuel is allowed to be burned locally, and what types of gas will flow through the gas grid. With these scenarios at our disposal, in the next research step, we will establish the impact of the scenarios on the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> grid – i. e. what the layout will be and the corresponding costs – and the accompanying biomethane infrastructure. For this, 3 typical locations were chosen: a rural region, an urban region, and an intermediate region.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling for <b>gas</b> monitoring and gas detection. The presented research is particularly focused on the methods that are suitable for uncontrolled environments. In such environments, gas source locations and the physical properties of the environment, such as humidity and temperature may be unknown or only sparse noisy local measurements are available. Example applications include air pollution monitoring, leakage detection, and search and rescue operations. This thesis addresses how to eﬃciently obtain and compute predictive models that accurately represent spatio-temporal <b>gas</b> <b>distribution.</b> Most statistical <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling methods assume that gas dispersion can be modelled as a time-constant random process. While this assumption may hold in some situations, {{it is necessary to}} model variations over time in order to enable applications of <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling for a wider range of realistic scenarios. This thesis proposes two time-dependent <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling methods. In the ﬁrst method, a temporal (sub-) sampling strategy is introduced.  In the second method, a time-dependent <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling approach is presented, which introduces a recency weight that relates measurement to prediction time. These contributions are presented and evaluated as an extension of a previously proposed method called Kernel DM+V using several simulation and real-world experiments. The results of comparing the proposed time-dependent <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling approaches to the time-independent version Kernel DM+V indicate a consistent improvement in the prediction of unseen measurements, particularly in dynamic scenarios under the condition that there is a suﬃcient spatial coverage. Dynamic scenarios are often deﬁned as environments where strong ﬂuctuations and gas plume development are present. For mobile robot olfaction, we are interested in sampling strategies that provide accurate <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> models given a small number of samples in a limited time span. Correspondingly, this thesis {{addresses the}} problem of selecting the most informative locations to acquire the next samples. As a further contribution, this thesis proposes a novel adaptive sensor planning method. This method is based on a modified artificial potential field, which selects the next sampling location based on the currently predicted <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> and the spatial distribution of previously collected samples. In particular, three objectives are used that direct the sensor towards areas of (1) high predictive mean and (2) high predictive variance, while (3) maximising the coverage area. The relative weight of these objectives corresponds to a trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the sampling strategy. This thesis discusses the weights or importance factors and evaluates the performance of the proposed sampling strategy. The results of the simulation experiments indicate an improved quality of the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> models when using the proposed sensor planning method compared to commonly used methods, such as random sampling and sampling along a predefined sweeping trajectory. In this thesis, we show that applying a locality constraint on the proposed sampling method decreases the travelling distance, which makes the proposed sensor planning approach suitable for real-world applications where limited resources and time are available. As a real-world use-case, we applied the proposed sensor planning approach on a micro-drone in outdoor experiments. Finally, this thesis discusses the potential of using <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling and sensor planning in large-scale outdoor real-world applications. We integrated the proposed methods in a framework for decision-making in hazardous inncidents where gas leakage is involved and applied the <b>gas</b> <b>distribution</b> modelling in two real-world use-cases.
