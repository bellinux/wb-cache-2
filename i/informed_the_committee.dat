5|$|On 16 December 1908, {{less than}} a week after the {{committee}} made its announcement, the six towns <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that an agreement had been reached and that a differential rating system for the next 20 years had been settled on. No valuation of assets would be undertaken and that each town was responsible for discharging any outstanding loans as of 31 December 1907. At this point the committee redrafted the bill according to the terms agreed by the towns and it was passed by the House of Lords on 19 December 1908. Returned to the House of Commons the bill was passed by the Commons the same day, with Royal Assent being received on 21 December 1908. The Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Confirmation Act (8 Edw. 7 c.clxiv) came into force on 31 March 1910 with the new council consisting of 78 councillors representing 26 wards. The new council as one of their first actions voted Cecil Wedgwood to be the first mayor of the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. Wedgwood had previously been appointed acting mayor (primarily to act as returning officer for the first municipal elections) by the Local Government Board. So as not to show bias towards any of the six town halls, the council held its inaugural meeting at the North Stafford Hotel. On 1 July 1925 the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent became the City of Stoke-on-Trent under letters patent from King George V dated 5 June 1925.|$|E
25|$|Press {{accounts}} in January 2016 indicated that Department of Defense staff were reviewing Department of Justice {{documents from the}} Petraeus prosecution and considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of Defense that Petraeus be demoted on the Army's retired list. Laws and regulations indicate {{that members of the}} military are retired at the last rank in which they are deemed to have served successfully; Petraeus' admission of an extramarital affair and guilty plea with regard to removing and retaining classified information while serving in the grade of General could be grounds for reduction in rank to Lieutenant General. The matter was reviewed by then-Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh before he left office in October 2015; he recommended no further action. On January 29, press {{accounts in}}dicated that Stephen C. Hedger, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, had written to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. In his letter, Hedger <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had concurred with the Army's recommendation, and would not impose any further punishment on Petraeus.|$|E
500|$|The Senate Judiciary Committee {{was also}} {{involved}} in investigating the matter, holding hearings beginning June 29, 1996, and focussing on allegations that White House was engaged in a [...] "dirty tricks" [...] operation reminiscent of the Nixon administration. Looking into accusations that senior White House officials or the First Lady may have inappropriately perused the files, in October 1996 Republican committee chair Orrin Hatch requested that the FBI do a fingerprint analysis of them. [...] On November 3, 1996, the FBI <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that no fingerprints of either the First Lady or any other named senior official were on the files.|$|E

500|$|In March 2017, after Trump {{was elected}} president, he wrote several posts on Twitter {{claiming}} that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped phones {{in the tower}} {{toward the end of}} the 2016 campaign. An Obama spokesperson refuted the claims, and during a subsequent conference with the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee that discussed the issue, FBI Director James Comey <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that there was no evidence of wiretapping in the tower. In response to allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, media outlets such as The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal have referred to Trump Tower as [...] "Russia House", especially after the wiretapping claims.|$|E
500|$|Fender played less {{frequently}} in the following seasons, as his appearances were restricted by journalistic and business requirements. He scored over 400 runs in each season between 1932 and 1935 and scored two centuries in that time, both in 1933. With the ball, he took over 60 wickets in each season, although with [...] higher bowling averages than earlier in his career. Having played regularly for the Gentlemen against the Players throughout his career, he made his last appearance in the match in 1934. [...] He continued {{to be an effective}} member of the county team, which he occasionally led when the regular captain—initially Jardine, later, Errol Holmes—was absent. Prior to the 1936 season Holmes suggested to Fender that he should play fewer games for Surrey that year. Rather than do so, Fender preferred not to play at all, and he <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that he would no longer represent the county. The committee publicly thanked Fender, but the reasons for the sudden termination of his county career are unclear; rumours suggested that some factions at Surrey wanted Fender out of the club. In the event, Fender played two first-class matches in 1936, captaining MCC teams against Oxford and Cambridge universities; these were his final appearances in first-class cricket. In all first-class matches, he scored 19,034 runs at an average of 26.65, and took 1,894 wickets at 25.05. He continued to play minor cricket for some time, and maintained his association with the sport for many years. His most notable appearance came after the war, when he captained an [...] "Old England XI", featuring many former England players, against Surrey in 1946 in a match to celebrate Surrey's centenary.|$|E
2500|$|A Republican staff member, Donald Sanders, {{found out}} about the White House tapes and <b>{{informed}}</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> on July 13, 1973. Thompson was informed of the existence of the tapes, and he, in turn, informed Nixon's attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt. [...] "Even though I had no authority to act for the committee, I decided to call Fred Buzhardt at home," [...] Thompson later wrote, [...] "I wanted {{to be sure that the}} White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action." ...|$|E
25|$|Following the Resistance {{uprising}} in Corsica on 11 September 1943, Giraud sent an expedition, including two French destroyers, {{to help the}} resistance movement without <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee.</b> This drew more criticism from de Gaulle, and he lost the co-presidency in November 1943.|$|R

In late January 2007, Citizenship and Immigration Minister Diane Finley <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> that this would be done. In February 2007, the CIC website was updated to reflect the fact that the policy has been updated.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{with the}} {{additional}} men, Austin realized that his army was not large enough to prevail in a full assault on Bexar. [...] The Texians thus prepared for a siege, looking for a position that was, {{in the words of}} historian Stephen L. Hardin, [...] "near Bexar, yet defensible against a sortie; in a position to block enemy communications arriving daily". On October 22, Austin named Bowie and Captain James W. Fannin co-commanders of the 1st Battalion and sent them on a reconnaissance mission. [...] By {{the end of the day}} the Texians had seized the Espada mission from Mexican pickets. [...] On October 24, Austin <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Public Safety that he had initiated a siege; in his opinion, the city could be taken in a few days if Texian reinforcements arrived quickly.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1939, Fermi, Szilard and Eugene Wigner {{met with}} Pegram in his office, and urged that their results {{be brought to}} the {{attention}} of the government. Pegram knew Charles Edison, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and arranged for Fermi to meet with Rear Admiral Stanford C. Hooper, the technical assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. Echoing sentiments his father had articulated back in 1911, Pegram informed Hooper that uranium chain reaction might [...] "liberate a million times as much energy per pound as any known explosive." [...] Szilard, Wigner and Albert Einstein took their concerns to the President Franklin Roosevelt in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted the creation of an Advisory Committee on Uranium under Lyman J. Briggs, the director of the National Bureau of Standards. On March 11, 1941, Pegram <b>informed</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> that it was [...] "very doubtful whether a chain reaction can be established without separating 235 from the rest of the uranium." [...] He therefore recommended that efforts be concentrated on finding a means of separating the isotopes.|$|E

That is why I made no complaint when they added to my duties the teaching of a class on another evening and the collecting of the subscriptions to the sewing society.
