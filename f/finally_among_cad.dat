40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) commonly co-exist. CAD patients may mistake GOR-induced pain for cardiac pain or GOR might provoke angina. Hypothesis: GOR might contribute to nocturnal/rest chest pain <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients. Methods: Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study investigating effect of Lansoprazole on chest pain; 125 patients with angiographically proven CAD enrolled {{with at least one}} weekly episode of nocturnal/rest pain, randomized to Lansoprazole 30 mg daily or placebo with crossover after 4 weeks. Symptoms recorded and QOL assessed by Nottingham Health Profile Questionnaire; ST segment depression episodes counted from 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring in final week of both periods. Statistical analysis: ANCOVA with period and carryover analysis. Results: 108 patients completed. There was a modest increase in pain-free days on Lansoprazole vs placebo (p< 0. 02), with fewer days with pain at rest (p< 0. 05) and at night (p< 0. 009) on Lansoprazole vs placebo, but no significant differences in ST segment depression episodes (p= 0. 64). There was a trend for reduction of the ‘physical pain' QOL domain. Conclusion: <b>Among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients, Lansoprazole modestly increases pain-free days and reduces rest/nocturnal pain. Since Lansoprazole did not affect ST segments, this may be by suppression of GOR-provoked pain misinterpreted as angina rather than acid-provoked ischaemia...|$|R

Though homocysteine levels <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> subjects of different populations in India have been studied, the association of hyperhomocysteinemia with conventional CAD risk factors has not been thoroughly investigated. Our objective was to study the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and a few conventional risk factors <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> subjects of Kerala. Methods and Results: We estimated plasma homocysteine concentration among coronary artery disease subjects (n= 92) and investigated the association of hyperhomocysteinemia with smoking, hypertension, diabetes and age in these subjects. Smokers had elevated homocysteine levels when compared to non-smokers (18. 3 ± 8. 8 vs. 12. 4 ± 6. 7 μmoles/L); increased homocysteine concentrations were noticed among hypertensives compared to non-hypertensives (15. 3 ± 6. 7 vs. 12. 9 ± 8. 5 μmoles/L), while no significant differences were noticed between diabetics and non-diabetics and also between subjects stratified into different groups based on age. Smoking and hypertension were found to contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia independent of other variables studied. Conclusions: It can be concluded from this study that among the variables studied, hyperhomocysteinemia was strongly associated with smoking and hypertension in CAD subjects of this population.

BackgroundCase-control studies showed that ED is associated with CAD in diabetic patients, but no prospective study is available. MethodsType 2 diabetic men (n = 291) with silent CAD angiographically documented were recruited. Erectile dysfunction was assessed by the International Index Erectile Function- 5 questionnaire. ResultsDuring a follow-up period of 47. 2 ± 21. 8 months (range 4 to 82 months), 49 patients experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The difference in ED prevalence between patients with and those without MACE was significant (61. 2 % vs. 36. 4 %; p = 0. 001). Cox regression analysis showed that ED predicted MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 6 to 2. 6; p < 0. 001). <b>Among</b> patients with <b>CAD</b> and ED, the Kaplan-Meier method showed that the statin (Mantel log-rank test: 3. 921; p = 0. 048) and 5 -phosphodiesterase (5 -PDE) inhibitor use (Mantel log-rank test: 4. 608; p = 0. 032) were associated with a lower rate of MACE. Cox regression analysis showed that statin use (HR 0. 66; 95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 97; p = 0. 036) reduced MACE. Treatment with 5 -PDE inhibitors did not enter the model, but its p value was very near to the significant level (HR 0. 68; 95 % CI 0. 46 to 1. 01; p = 0. 056).

Materials and methods: In the 646 chronic CAD patients (72. 4 % males) coronary angiograms were scored by quantitative assessment using multiple angiographic scoring system, Traditional risk factors were self reported or measured by standard methods. ABO blood distribution of patients was compared with group of 651 healthy blood donors (74. 6 % males). Results: Among all ABO blood group patients {{there was no significant difference}} between the extent of coronary atherosclerosis with regard to all the three scoring systems: number of affected coronary arteries (P = 0. 857), Gensini score (P = 0. 818), and number of segments narrowed > 50 % (P = 0. 781).

40|$|Abstract Global and {{regional}} left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is {{a marker of}} coronary artery disease (CAD), which is conventionally assessed using two-dimensional echocardiography. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) has emerged as an adjunct tool in the diagnosis of regional wall motion abnormalities from CAD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of TDI indices in the diagnosis of CAD. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for controlled studies comparing TDI measurements in those with and without CAD as confirmed by coronary angiography. Meta-analyses of mean differences in TDI velocities between these populations were performed. Screening of titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening identified 8 studies. At rest, TDI {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in the pooled maximum systolic velocity <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients compared to those without CAD [mean difference (MD) : - 0. 66; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 0. 98 to − 0. 34]. There {{were no significant differences in}} maximum early and late diastolic velocities. Post-stress, TDI was associated with a significant decrease in maximum early diastolic velocity (MD: - 1. 91; 95 % CI: - 2. 74 to − 1. 09) and maximum late diastolic velocity (MD: - 1. 57; 95 % CI: - 2. 95 to − 0. 18) <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients compared to those without CAD. There was no significant difference in maximum systolic velocity post-stress. Our results suggest that TDI may have a role in the evaluation of CAD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although several common {{community}} infections {{have been}} associated with the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), their {{role in the development of}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still unclear. We examined the prevalence of IgG and IgM (or IgA) antibodies against common infections such as HSV, Hepatitis A (HAV), Helicobacter pylori (HP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), in CAD and AMI patients, and their relationship with pro-atherogenic inflammatory molecules. METHODS: A total number of 337 subjects were included in this study: 150 patients with angiographically documented stable CAD, 138 patients admitted with AMI and 49 healthy individuals. Serum IgG and IgM against HAV, CMV and HSV, IgG against HP and IgG/IgA against CP were determined in all participants. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble vascular cells adhesion molecule (sVCAM- 1), were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Patients with CAD were more likely to have anti-HAV IgG (94. 4 %), anti-HSV IgG (97. 2 %) and anti-HP IgG (55. 1 %) compared to healthy individuals (70. 8 %, 89. 6 % and 39. 6 % respectively, p< 0. 05 for all). In multivariate analysis, anti-HAV IgG was an independent predictor of CAD (beta(SE) : 0. 187 (0. 075), p= 0. 015). <b>Among</b> the <b>CAD</b> patients, the presence of anti-CP IgA was more frequent in those admitted with AMI (39 %) compared to those with stable CAD (21 %, p< 0. 05). Finally, both patients and controls had significantly higher levels of sVCAM- 1 and TNF-alpha in the presence of anti-HAV IgG, compared to those without anti-HAV IgG (p< 0. 05 for all). CONCLUSION: Past infections with HAV, HSV and HP are associated with higher risk for coronary atherosclerosis, while the presence of anti-HAV IgG is also associated with higher levels of TNF-alpha and sVCAM- 1. Furthermore, the presence of recent infection by CP is associated with higher risk for AMI <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients. These findings are important since they demonstrate that past HAV, HSV and HP infections may affect cardiovascular risk, while recent CP infection may be implicated in the triggering of AMI <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients...|$|R

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} disorder and {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. There are a number of CAD medications, which are effective and safe in most patients, but have been associated with adverse reactions such as angioedema induced by angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (AE-ACEi). In this study, we identified aminopeptidase P (APP) activity as an endophenotype for AE-ACEi, which is a heritable quantitative trait (heritability = 0. 336 +/- 0. 251 SD) and is significantly reduced in a majority of our cases. Although initial mutation screening did not reveal any coding variants in XPNPEP 2, which encodes membrane-bound APP, subsequent linkage analysis of APP activity in eight families provided a maximum LOD score (3. 75) for this locus. Sequencing of additional cases identified a splice variant (314 _ 431 del) and a non-coding polymorphism (rs 3788853) in this locus, which cosegregate with low plasma APP activity. The latter accounts for the linkage signal and is associated with AE-ACEi (P = 0. 036). In addition, we identified other potential loci for APP activity and demonstrated that certain ACEi (Captopril and Enalapril) non-specifically inhibit APP activity. Furthermore, we detected polymorphisms associated with reduced APP and ACE activities among females with estrogen-dependent inherited angioedema. We also conducted a genetic investigation of depression <b>among</b> <b>CAD</b> patients to identify common susceptibility loci which might explain the correlation between these diseases. Our candidate gene association study identified a polymorphism (rs 216873) in the von Willebrand factor gene that was significantly associated (P = 7. 4 x 10 - 5) with elevated depressive symptoms in our CAD cohort.

This dissertation contributes to the field of genetics and pharmacogenomics of CAD. A better understanding of the toxic effects of CAD drugs will assist in the development of safer and more effective treatments.
