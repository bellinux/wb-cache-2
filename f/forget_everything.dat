5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> that has happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps {{dangerous}} and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] is a midtempo glam rock ballad sung with {{vulnerable}} and breathy vocals in a falsetto tone. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a metronome of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the note of C4 to the note of E5. The song includes a [...] "rocking" [...] instrumental and a heavy guitar break. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the track to songs by Green Day. Lyrically, [...] "Don't Forget" [...] is about one of Lovato's old love interests who left her {{just as she was}} falling in love with him. The theme is demonstrated in lyrical lines such as, [...] "Did you forget that I was even alive? Did you <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> we ever had?" ...|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we <b>forget</b> <b>everything,</b> and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Griffin family {{watching}} television. A commercial for local auditions of the syndicated game show Family Feud is shown, prompting {{them to try}} out the next day. The Griffins are chosen for the show and reach the final round. During a fight with Richard Dawson about welching on the prize money, Peter hits his head. This causes him to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> about his life, including his family and friends. Lois tries to jog his memory by reintroducing him to his old self, including his children and his sex life. Unfortunately, this causes Peter to believe that he's free to {{have sexual relations with}} others in his newfound [...] "bachelorhood." [...] Lois had earlier told him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his children - in response, Meg attempts an incest joke ("Well, I wish you would've told him that BEFORE he lost his memory!"). Most of the family lambaste her for this and Chris kicks her out of the room. Deeply angered, Lois decides to move out, taking the kids. When Quagmire finds out, he jumps on the opportunity to pursue a relationship with Lois.|$|E

500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E
500|$|Chris Kelly of Fact said, [...] "By {{embracing}} the codeine-weed-molly trifecta, hashtag-friendly hooks, and — perhaps most significantly — ascendant producers, the 38-year-old rapper has maintained rap relevance, even as {{that has become}} more difficult than ever." [...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, [...] "For all its vulgarity, predictability, repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs, Juicy J's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit." [...] Julia LeConte of Now said, [...] "The whole thing isn't about disrespecting women, though. Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple-pleasure narratives: popping molly, making money. On his third solo record, the Three 6 Mafia rapper signed to Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang is 'getting high like he's 18.' At 38, though, it's not super-amusing, like J is the hip-hop Peter Pan refusing to grow up among a crew of younger emcees." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated, [...] "Stay Trippy can be musically compelling. Granted, the words are hard to miss. [...] "Stay motivated, stay high, stay hustling, (<b>forget)</b> <b>everything</b> else," [...] he intones on [...] "So Much Money", a title that sums up the highest virtue in J's world." [...] David [...] "Rek" [...] Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word. Then there are songs that {{are meant to be}} played loud in public settings, and the lyrics don't matter so much. If you haven't already figured it out, Stay Trippy is the latter. And for as much flack as it receives, there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the 'trippy' lifestyle." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Prime Minister of Topsyturveydom {{arrives at}} the home of old Satis, a member of parliament.

The people are born elderly and grow younger until they become infants. They start out wise and gradually <b>forget</b> <b>everything,</b> until at last their minds are a perfect blank. Folly is honoured, wisdom is despised, true beauty consists in making yourself ugly, and people walk on the ceiling with their heads on the floor. He has been comparing customs in the two countries and invites Satis to accompany him to Topsyturveydom. Satis readily agrees.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by Rolfe Kent who previously composed music for Reitman's Thank You for Smoking (2005), Up in the Air (2009) and Young Adult (2011). The album features I'm Going Home from Arlo Guthrie and Here Before from Vashti Bunyan. It also contains guitar pieces by Andrés Segovia and Shin-Ichi Fukuda. Talking about the music, Kent said that [...] "You know it’s simple to compose happy or sad music, but {{to create something}} simple yet sophisticated, that calls the listener to be curious and yet uncertain and perhaps a little unnerved, well it called me to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> I knew about composition and discover a whole new musical language. It was at once incredibly stressful, and deeply rewarding." ...|$|E

In his Tafseer, Ibn Kathir writes, [...] "Khushoo is gained by the fear of Allah and the sense that He is always watching." [...] In another section he says, [...] "The site of al-Khushoo is in the heart and heart is {{the king of the}} limbs, so if one intends to pray wholeheartedly the limbs will follow the heart as Allah says (in the Qur'an): 'And seek help in patience and Salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard, except for Khashi'oon.'

2500|$|Russia was {{awaiting}} at the semi-finals. The Lithuanians, who had yet {{to defeat}} the Russians, failed to accomplish this again. After the first six minutes, the Russians had an 18–3 lead, which escalated to 33–14. However, the Lithuanians' resilience made them erase the deficit by the third quarter, 52–52. Eventually, fatigue that remained from the tough quarterfinal caugh up with Lithuania, especially playing against such a powerful adversary. The Russian won 86–74, {{despite the efforts of}} Lithuanian captain Ramūnas Šiškauskas, who scored 30 points. Following the game, Šarūnas Jasikevičius declared that: [...] "We have to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> and endeavor to win the medals. [...] The situation of the Greeks is the same as ours. They also painfully lost, they will wish to achieve the medals as well. We will give everything we got and we will try to win".|$|E
2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll <b>forget</b> <b>everything,</b> it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why do you keep saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E

When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said [...] "It was like I had to <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> I had learned." [...] Obata said that he used [...] "a lot of effort" [...] to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of [...] "a brilliant person," [...] so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a [...] "smart and formal guy" [...] who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in Death Note is [...] "fitted" [...] and Obata avoided jeans.|$|E

2500|$|Wataru Mitani is a {{quiet and}} unassuming fifth grader in Japan. A new student called Mitsuru Ashikawa begins {{attending}} Wataru's school, though {{he is in a}} different class. There are also rumors circulating about the Daimatsu building, an empty, unfinished building near Wataru's school: witnesses claimed to have seen a ghost wandering behind the building's blue tarps. One day after school, while out with his uncle, Wataru witnesses an old man entering the abandoned building. Wataru follows him into the building and stumbles into the strange world of Vision. In Vision, he is told that the portal he crossed, called the Porta Nectere, opens only once every ten years for ninety days. People from his world are strictly forbidden to enter Vision unless they obtain the status of Traveler from [...] "the gatekeeper". Unfortunately, he is also told he will <b>forget</b> <b>everything</b> of his visit. Upon re-entering the Porta Nectere, his uncle wakens him and he finds that Vision was a dream; Wataru supposedly fell from the stairs of the Daimatsu building. Wataru's uncle brings Wataru home only to discover a terrible truth: the boy's parents are divorcing and his father is leaving with his mistress, leaving his wife and Wataru behind. Both Wataru and his mother are shocked, and to add to Wataru's stress, he finds his memories of Vision slipping away. Later, Wataru's father's lover confronts Wataru's mother over who Wataru's father really loves. After this encounter, Wataru's mother attempts suicide by leaving on the gas in the house. Mitsuru visits him, warns him of the gas, and tells him to go to Vision if he wants to change his fate. Wataru struggles to remember, but he finally goes to the Daimatsu building to cross the portal to Vision. Thus, Wataru's journey in Vision begins.|$|E
