25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
2500|$|Among Cook's most bold assertions was that, {{utilizing}} his strategies, a {{team could}} gain up to 250 runs a season, a number which modern methods indicate {{is an extreme}} overestimate. Years later, sabermetrician Pete Palmer and sports historian John Thorn asserted that their computer simulations using Cook's lineup modifications actually slightly {{reduce the number of}} runs a team scored. Bill James would later write in his 1981 Baseball Abstract that [...] "Cook <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> statistics and nothing at all about baseball--and for that reasons, all of his answers are wrong, all of his methods useless." [...] Earnshaw Cook also dismissed the effects of player handedness (thus, condemning the use of the platoon system), which even contemporary studies pointed out to be erroneous. Cook did, however, uncover several important pieces of information which are now accepted as common knowledge in modern sabermetrics, such as the inefficiency of the sacrifice bunt. More importantly, the material generated discussion on statistical analysis in baseball and introduced many baseball fans to objective research. [...] In 1971, Waverly Press published Cook's follow-up to Percentage Baseball titled Percentage Baseball and the Computer, in which Cook describes many pieces of strategy his computer simulations suggest.|$|E
2500|$|Zigu Ornea's {{contribution}} to historiographic research and critical study was viewed with much interest by his colleagues, and often earned him high praise. Writer Augustin Buzura called him [...] "a great historian" [...] and [...] "an encyclopédiste", while Jewish community leader Nicolae Cajal defined him as [...] "a Wise Man" [...] whose interest touched [...] "everything that brought intelligence {{in a person}} or in a book." [...] Likewise, poet and art historian Pavel Șușară viewed Ornea's works as both [...] "dauntingly" [...] voluminous and impressive {{from the point of}} view of research, noting that they produced [...] "one of the most fascinating webs of facts, ideologies, doctrines, adventures and historical dramas." [...] Literary critic Ion Simuț primarily noted his colleague's {{contribution to}} [...] "criticism of ideas", alongside his philological enterprises and his work as editor and publisher, arguing that they provided Ornea with a global perspective on Romanian culture. Simuț also ranks Ornea, whose weekly literary chronicles he describes as marked by [...] "seriousness, thoroughness and consistency", among [...] "an elite category" [...] of literary historians, placing him alongside Ion Bălu, Paul Cornea, Dan Mănucă, Al. Săndulescu, Mircea Zaciu and [...] "some, not many, others." [...] Writing in 2001, his colleague Mircea Iorgulescu also assessed: [...] "Z. Ornea was incapable of fanaticism, irrational stubbornness and deliriums, and his enormous, but never ostentatious, knowledge of written culture had not rendered him haughty. [...] His works [...] are fundamental for understanding modern Romania. Their vastness was amazing to the point of the unbelievable, and this was decades ago." [...] Literary critic Marius Chivu defined Ornea as [...] "the historian who <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> everyone who ever wrote one page of literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|By January 1944, {{thanks to}} the {{documents}} sold by Bazna, Papen was reporting to Berlin that he <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> British efforts to bring Turkey into the war on the Allied side, {{and he had a}} document saying that Britain would focus on the Mediterranean until Operation Overlord was launched that spring. Papen guessed correctly that Operation Overlord was the liberation of France, as the document made it clear that Overlord would not be launched in the Mediterranean, but the document did not say just when and where Overlord would be launched, limiting its value. In January 1944, Papen had learned via the [...] "Cicero documents" [...] of a British plan to have the Royal Air Force use airfields in Turkey to bomb the oil fields of Ploiești in Romania, which supplied Germany with most of its oil. Papen told the Turkish foreign minister Hüseyin Numan Menemencioğlu if the Turks allowed the RAF to use Turkish air fields to bomb Ploiești, then the Luftwaffe would use its bases in Bulgaria and Greece to bomb Turkey, threatening that [...] "the least consequences would be the complete destruction of Istanbul and Izmir". Papen reported to Ribbentrop that {{thanks to the}} [...] "Cicero documents" [...] that [...] "this round in the campaign for Turkey has been won by us...a Balkan offensive could not now take place". The British code-breakers at Bletchley Park had intercepted messages from Papen to Ribbentrop and Hitler in January 1944 mentioning a spy code-named Cicero was working in German pay, but as Papen preferred to use the diplomatic mailbag to report information to Berlin, Bletchley Park could not reveal much. An American spy in the Auswärtige Amt, Fritz Kolbe, told the OSS in February 1944 that someone in the British embassy in Ankara whose code-name was Cicero was selling secrets to Papen, which triggered an investigation that caused Bazna to break off contact. However, despite the intelligence sold by Bazna, the Allies were winning the war and on 20 April 1944, the Turks wishing to ingratiate themselves with the winners, ceased selling chrome to Germany. On 26 May 1944 Menemencioğlu announced that Turkey was reducing exports to Germany by 50%, and on 2 August 1944 Turkey severed diplomatic relations with Germany, forcing Papen to return to Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were happy to see him venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of little game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E
