25|$|Glover {{sought to}} make a film {{biography}} of Toussaint Louverture for his directorial debut. In May 2006, the film had included cast members Wesley Snipes, Angela Bassett, Don Cheadle, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Roger Guenveur Smith, Mos Def, Isaach de Bankolé, and Richard Bohringer. Production, estimated to cost $30 million, was planned to begin in Poland, filming from late 2006 into early 2007. In May 2007, President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez contributed $18 million to fund the production of Toussaint for Glover, who is a prominent U.S. supporter of Chávez. The contribution annoyed some Venezuelan filmmakers, who said the money could have funded other homegrown films and that Glover's film was not <b>even</b> <b>about</b> Venezuela. In April 2008, the Venezuelan National Assembly authorized an additional $9,840,505 for Glover's film, which is still in planning.|$|E

500|$|Studies {{done in the}} 1960s and 1970s in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Burma {{showed that}} {{a great deal of}} time, effort and money was {{invested}} by people in merit-making, e.g. Spiro described Burma's rural economy as [...] "geared to the overriding goal of the accumulation of wealth as a means of acquiring merit". In some studies done in rural Burma, up to thirty percent of people's income was spent on merit-making. In 2014, when Burma ranked highest on the World Giving Index (tied with the United States, and followed by many other Buddhist countries), scholars attributed this to the Burmese habit of merit-making. Studies done in Thailand, however, showed that in the 1980s merit-making was declining, and a significant group did no longer believe in karma—though this was not a majority. Some scholars disagree with these findings, however, saying that Buddhist practices such as merit-making [...] are still very widespread. Similar observations have been made about Cambodia and <b>even</b> <b>about</b> Thai people in the United States. As for Buddhist [...] "converts" [...] in the west, for example from the United Kingdom, the interest in merit is less than among Asian Buddhists, but they strongly appreciate the generosity and reverence as exhibited by Asian Buddhists.|$|E
500|$|Up to this point, {{soap operas}} used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, [...] "critique power relationships, {{especially}} {{the oppression of}} the poor by the rich and of women by men". [...] Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and [...] "failed to capture the complex power relations underlying... violence towards women". [...] The perpetrators were [...] "simply evil or out control", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. [...] The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: [...] "the evil instigator" [...] (Todd); [...] "the good resister" [...] (Powell), and [...] "the mediator between these polarized figures" [...] (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. [...] Brooks called the rapists [...] "a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist", {{because they had a}} different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the [...] "evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. [...] Hayward said, [...] "What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or <b>even</b> <b>about</b> Marty. It is about what takes place... between men." ...|$|E

500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not <b>even</b> <b>about</b> the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E
2500|$|However, because DCTs {{operate on}} finite, {{discrete}} sequences, two issues arise {{that do not}} apply for the continuous cosine transform. [...] First, one has to specify whether the function is even or odd at {{both the left and}} right boundaries of the domain (i.e. the min-n and max-n boundaries in the definitions below, respectively). [...] Second, one has to specify around what point the function is even or odd. [...] In particular, consider a sequence abcd of four equally spaced data points, and say that we specify an even left boundary. [...] There are two sensible possibilities: either the data are <b>even</b> <b>about</b> the sample a, in which case the even extension is dcbabcd, or the data are <b>even</b> <b>about</b> the point halfway between a and the previous point, in which case the even extension is dcbaabcd (a is repeated).|$|E

They later attracted attention in the 1980s when it was reported that their discovery had in fact been an elaborate hoax, and doubt was raised both about their status as isolated from other societies and <b>even</b> <b>about</b> the reality of their existence as a separate ethnic group.

2500|$|From 1929, he {{attended}} Repton School in Derbyshire. Dahl had unhappy {{experiences of the}} school, describing an environment of ritual cruelty and acting as personal servants for older boys along with terrible beatings; these violent experiences are described in Donald Sturrock's biography of Dahl. [...] There are echoes of these darker experiences in Dahl's writings and his hatred of cruelty and corporal punishment. According to Boy: Tales of Childhood, a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster Geoffrey Fisher, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury {{and went on to}} crown Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. (However, according to Dahl's biographer Jeremy Treglown, the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton and the headmaster concerned was in fact J. T. Christie, Fisher's successor.) This caused Dahl to [...] "have doubts about religion and <b>even</b> <b>about</b> God". He was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report [...] "I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Highlighting {{what he sees}} as the {{difficulty}} in understanding the guru from Eastern tradition in Western society, Dr. Georg Feuerstein, a well-known German-American Indologist, writes in the article [...] from his book The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice:"The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not <b>even</b> <b>about</b> morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing.". In his Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of yoga to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.|$|E
2500|$|Few clear {{facts about}} Simonides' life {{have come down}} to modern times {{in spite of his}} fame and influence. Ancient sources are {{uncertain}} <b>even</b> <b>about</b> the date of his birth. According to the Byzantine encyclopaedia, Suda: [...] "He was born in the 56th Olympiad (556/552 BC) or according to some writers in the 62nd (532/528) and he survived until the 78th (468/464), having lived eighty-nine years." [...] Modern scholars generally accept 556-468 BC for his life in spite of some awkward consequences—for example it would make him about fifty years older than his nephew Bacchylides and still very active internationally at about 80 years of age. Other ancient sources also have awkward consequences. For example, according to an entry in the Parian Marble, Simonides died in 468/7 BC at the age of ninety yet, in another entry, it lists a victory by his grandfather in a poetry competition in Athens in 489/488 BC—this grandfather must have been over a hundred years old at that time if the birth dates for Simonides are correct. The grandfather's name, as recorded by the Parian Marble, was also Simonides, and it has been argued by some scholars that the earliest references to Simonides in ancient sources might in fact be references to this grandfather. However, the Parian Marble is known to be unreliable and possibly it was not even the grandfather but a grandson that won the aforementioned victory in Athens. According to the Suda, this grandson was yet another Simonides and he was the author of books on genealogy.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting [...] {{together}} with [...] Maimonides taught that judges {{must be on}} {{the highest level of}} righteousness. An effort should be made that they be white-haired, of impressive height, of dignified appearance, and people who understand whispered matters and who understand many different languages so that the court will not need to hear testimony from an interpreter. Maimonides taught that one need not demand that a judge for a court of three possess all these qualities, but a judge must, however, possess seven attributes: wisdom, humility, fear of God, loathing for money, love for truth, being beloved by people at large, and a good reputation. Maimonides cited [...] “Men of wisdom and understanding,” for the requirement of wisdom. [...] continues, “Beloved by your tribes,” which Maimonides read to refer to those who are appreciated by people at large. Maimonides taught that what will make them beloved by people is conducting themselves with a favorable eye and a humble spirit, being good company, and speaking and conducting their business with people gently. Maimonides read [...] “men of power,” to refer to people who are mighty in their observance of the commandments, who are very demanding of themselves, and who overcome their evil inclination until they possess no unfavorable qualities, no trace of an unpleasant reputation, even during their early adulthood, they were spoken of highly. Maimonides read [...] “men of power,” also to imply that they should have a courageous heart to save the oppressed from the oppressor, as [...] reports, “And Moses arose and delivered them.” Maimonides taught that just as Moses was humble, so, too, every judge should be humble. [...] continues “God-fearing,” which is clear. [...] mentions “men who hate profit,” which Maimonides took to refer to people who do not become overly concerned <b>even</b> <b>about</b> their own money; they do not pursue the accumulation of money, for anyone who is overly concerned about wealth will ultimately be overcome by want. [...] continues “men of truth,” which Maimonides took to refer to people who pursue justice because of their own inclination; they love truth, hate crime, and flee from all forms of crookedness.|$|E
