5000|$|The {{rationale}} {{for a party}} admission exception to <b>hearsay</b> <b>exclusion</b> can be mostly easily understood by reference to the {{rationale for}} the hearsay rule itself. Affidavit evidence consisting of out-of-court statements, is not subject to Cross-examination. Affidavit evidence is thought to detract from the truth-finding mission of a trial. The accuracy or credibility of affidavits lack the transparency that cross-examination exacts, but—at least in civil cases—a party may be cross-examined or give an explanation or denial of its admission. In criminal cases, however, [...] "modern psychological interrogation techniques can cause innocent suspects" [...] to falsely admit to crimes. Therefore, depending on the context, party admissions may advance, rather than detract from, the truth-finding mission.|$|E
