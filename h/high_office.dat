5|$|In the post-election {{speculation}} as to {{who would}} be given office under McKinley, Hay's name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought <b>high</b> <b>office</b> in the State Department, either as secretary {{or one of the}} major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. Reid, an asthmatic, handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory for the winter, leading to speculation about his health.|$|E

5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to <b>high</b> <b>office,</b> in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for <b>high</b> <b>office,</b> and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E

40|$|Are <b>higher</b> <b>office</b> seekers {{punished by}} PACs when seeking <b>higher</b> <b>office</b> {{because of a}} {{drop-off}} in policy specialization, or rewarded because of {{a need for more}} campaign receipts? Research shows a positive relationship between PAC contributions and legislative effectiveness or high analytical capacity (Box-Steffensmeir and Grant, 1999; Esterling, 2007), and legislators with progressive ambition exhibit greater levels of policy specialization (see Herrick and Moore, 1993). However, we know that when legislators are actively campaigning for <b>higher</b> <b>office,</b> they display less policy specialization because of electoral incentives to appeal to a broader electorate (Victor 2010). Should legislators who are running a campaign for <b>higher</b> <b>office</b> therefore attract more PAC money because of electoral demands, or less PAC money because of a decline in legislative specialization? We argue that ambitious Members of Congress (MCs) have an incentive to engage in policy specialization over their House career until they initiate a campaign for <b>higher</b> <b>office.</b> MCs do not suffer financially from changing their behavior in a way that interest groups may not prefer...|$|R

5|$|Chodkiewicz was not {{particularly}} involved {{in the politics of}} the Commonwealth, although his <b>high</b> <b>office</b> and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications. His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained <b>high</b> <b>office</b> during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media.

This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E

5|$|Read {{retired from}} {{military}} life on 20 March 1975 and was succeeded by Air Marshal James Rowland, {{who later became}} Governor of New South Wales.

As CAS during the Whitlam Labor government, which was generally antipathetic to imperial knighthoods, he was not raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) until the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, after the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser had been returned to power. Originally from Vaucluse, in Sydney's east, by 2010 Read was living in Safety Beach, on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. He died at Woolgoolga and District Retirement Village on 17September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 312 BC, the Plebeian Council {{enacted the}} Plebiscitum Ovinium. During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. This initiative, however, {{transferred}} this {{power to the}} censors. It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, plebeians were already holding {{a significant number of}} magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only patricians were allowed to stand for <b>high</b> <b>office.</b> The new nobility existed due to the organization of society.

5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office.

Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party.

5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as members of the Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta <b>high</b> <b>office</b> holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully integrated with the Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained <b>high</b> <b>office</b> under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E

5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for <b>high</b> <b>office</b> not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to <b>high</b> <b>office</b> abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E

5|$|Stephen {{was the son}} of Bogdan, who was a son of Alexander the Good, Prince of Moldavia. Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea, {{was most}} {{probably}} related to the princes of Wallachia, according to historian Radu Florescu. The date of Stephen's birth is unknown, though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440. One church diptych records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria. Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that Cârstea Arbore, father of the statesman Luca Arbore, was the prince's fourth brother, or that Cârstea was the same as Ioachim. These links with the high-ranking Moldavian boyars are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of Șendrea, gatekeeper of Suceava; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held <b>high</b> <b>office</b> at his court.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} of Dokeianos is {{considered}} to derive from Dokia in the Armeniac Theme. The family only came into prominence in the mid-11th century, with Michael {{one of the first}} to be mentioned. He is generally considered as the Dokeianos who married an unnamed daughter of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos and sister of the future emperor Isaac I Komnenos (reigned 1057–59), probably ca. 1030. Together, they had a son, Theodore Dokeianos. According to the near-contemporary official and historian John Skylitzes, Michael Dokeianos was a simple man and not suited for command, and according to the modern scholar Konstantinos Varzos he owed his rise to <b>high</b> <b>office</b> to his family ties with the Komnenoi. It is known that he was wealthy, and possessed estates in Paphlagonia, possibly adjacent or part of the Komnenos family estates in the same region.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was of humble origin, and {{was born}} in the late 13th century somewhere in Bithynia. He {{nevertheless}} studied under the scholar Theodore Hyrtakenos, and became a tax official. By 1320 he was director of the salt pans, from which he later advanced to the position of domestikos of the themes of the West. He rose in the bureaucratic hierarchy until, in 1321, he was appointed the imperial parakoimōmenos (chamberlain). His position made him useful to John Kantakouzenos, who included him in a conspiracy, together with Syrgiannes Palaiologos and the prōtostratōr Theodore Synadenos, which aimed to depose the aging Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in favour of his grandson Andronikos III. Under the threat of war, the Emperor surrendered Thrace and some districts in Macedonia to the rule of his grandson. When Andronikos III became sole emperor in 1328, his close friend Kantakouzenos became his chief minister, and Alexios was awarded with the positions that Kantakouzenos himself had formerly held: head of the imperial secretariat (mesazōn) and in charge of the state's finances. These positions allowed him to amass a considerable personal fortune, which he used to construct a personal refuge, a fortified tower-house at the site of Epibatai near Selymbria, at the coast of the Sea of Marmara. In early 1341, shortly before Andronikos's death, he was rewarded with the <b>high</b> <b>office</b> of megas doux, giving him the high command over the Byzantine navy. He re-equipped the fleet, paying from his own pocket 100,000 hyperpyra.|$|E
