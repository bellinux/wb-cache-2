2500|$|Professor Robert A. Oden, {{formerly}} of Dartmouth College, taught that the Jahwist's creation story in [...] reflects {{that human beings}} are dissatisfied by our status as mortals, knowing less than we would like to know.

Oden taught that Judaism never read the story as Original Sin or the Fall of Man, but as just one more instance of human beings getting into trouble, and God rescuing them and giving them another chance.|$|E
