Low frequency acceleration noise introduced by the electrostatic force needed to counter static mass distribution imbalance {{is expected to be}} a significant contributor to the acceleration noise budget. For this reason, the self-gravity (due to mass imbalance) is minimized by adding trim mass to bring the total differential acceleration between the two test masses due to self-gravity below 5 x 10 - 10 m/s 2 in any axis and the DC acceleration gradient due to self-gravity below 4 x 10 - 8 m/s 2 /m in any axis of either test mass. A plan has been established to develop the distribution and placement of the compensation masses. Compensation for the self-gravity effects on the two test masses is handled in a two step process. A nominal compensation mass is defined and incorporated early and is located very near the test masses. The <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> for self-gravity occurs after the integration on the spacecraft with small mass added externally to the test mass vacuum enclosures. The plan identifies three preliminary points in the hardware maturity where the trimming to the as-built configuration can take place: (1) during build-up of the sensor vacuum enclosure, (2) prior to delivery of the integrated ST- 7 to Europe, and (3) prior to environmental testing of the integrated LPF system.

40|$|<b>Final</b> <b>trimming</b> of the 3 ' {{terminus}} of tRNA precursors in Escherichia coli {{is thought}} to proceed by an exonucleolytic mechanism. However, mutant strains lacking {{as many as four}} exoribonucleases known to act on tRNA still grow normally and process tRNA normally. Extracts from such a multiple-RNase-deficient strain accurately mature tRNA precursors exonucleolytically in vitro in a reaction that requires inorganic phosphate. Here we show that this reaction is not due to polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) but, rather, that it is mediated by a phosphate-requiring exonuclease that we have named RNase PH. Purified PNPase is incapable of completely processing tRNA precursors, and extracts from a PNPase- strain retain full activity for phosphorolytic processing. Although both PNPase and RNase PH act in a phosphorolytic manner, they differ substantially in size and substrate specificity. RNase PH has a molecular mass of 45 - 50 kDa and favors tRNA precursors as substrates. The possible physiological role of RNase PH and the advantages of phosphorolytic processing are discussed...|$|E

In human and murine cells, Eri 1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus, with enrichment in the nucleolus, the site of preribosome biogenesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an ocular micrometer, the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during trimming. Several devices and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967). Gorycki (1978) described a "rectangular trimming block " which, {{in conjunction with a}} small mirror mounted on the knife holder of the ultramicrotome, squarely re-trimmed the block face of a preformed truncated pyramid. Similarly, Sjostrand's device (Sjostrand 1967) is a trimming aid intended only for the <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> and retrimming of tissue blocks. Using such instruments, block faces with parallel edge alignment can be, with an experienced hand, precisely produced...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hot {{stamping}} of High Strength Steels sheets {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} popularity, particularly in the automotive industry, due to the sound microstructures achieved {{at the end of}} the process. The significant improvement of the mechanical properties achieved in the process enables to reduce the initial sheet thickness in favour of cost and fuel consumption reduction. However, a martensitic microstructure implies significant drawbacks in <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> and cutting operations, which becomes more difficult and expensive due to tools wear and high blanking forces. This paper aims at investigating the performances of non-metallic materials to be used in heated dies, in order to inhibit the martensite formation by locally reducing the sheet cooling rate. To analyze the influence of the main process parameters, a new experimental set-up was designed and developed in a laboratory environment that allow applying controlled pressure and temperatures to HSS metal sheets. An analytical model was set-up in order to evaluate the influence of process conditions on the cooling profiles in different areas of the specimen. Accordingly, experiments were carried out to investigate the material behaviour when cooled in the different conditions. The experimentally acquired temperatures were analyzed and evaluated together with hardness measurements of metal sheets in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach in producing microstructurally-tailored components...|$|E

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, pre-mRNAs undergo extensive processing in {{the nucleus}} prior to export. Processing {{is subject to}} a quality-control mechanism that retains improperly processed transcripts at or near sites of transcription. A poly(A) tail added by the normal 3 ′-processing machinery is necessary but not sufficient for export. Retention depends on the exosome. In this study, we identify the poly(A) -binding protein, Pab 1, and the poly(A) nuclease, PAN, as important factors that couple 3 ′ processing to export. Pab 1 contains a nonessential leucine-rich nuclear export signal and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It can exit the nucleus either as cargo of exportin 1 or bound to mRNA. Pab 1 is essential but several bypass suppressors have been identified. Deletion of PAB 1 from these bypass suppressor strains results in exosome-dependent retention at sites of transcription. Retention is also seen in cells lacking PAN, which Pab 1 is thought to recruit and which {{may be responsible for}} the final step of mRNA biogenesis, trimming of the poly(A) tail to the length found on newly exported mRNAs.

Experiential avoidance had both a direct and indirect effect, via NPO and ICS social problem solving, on IPV victimization and perpetration.

40|$|Peptide {{splicing}} {{is a novel}} {{mechanism of}} production of peptides relying on the proteasome and involving the linkage of fragments originally distant in the parental protein. Peptides produced by splicing can be presented on class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex and recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Here, we describe a new antigenic peptide, which is presented by HLA-A 3 and comprises two non-contiguous fragments of the melanoma differentiation antigen gp 100 PMEL 17 spliced together in the reverse order to that in which they appear in the parental protein. Contrary to the previously described spliced peptides, which are produced by the association of fragments of 3 to 6 amino acids, the peptide described here results from the ultimate association of an 8 -amino acid fragment with a single arginine residue. As described before, peptide splicing {{takes place in the}} proteasome by transpeptidation involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate linking one of the peptide fragment to a catalytic subunit of the proteasome. Interestingly, we observe that the peptide causing the nucleophilic attack on the acyl-enzyme intermediate must be at least three-amino acid long in order to give rise to a spliced peptide. The spliced peptide produced from this reaction therefore bears an extended C-terminus that needs to be further trimmed in order to produce the final antigenic peptide. We show that the proteasome is able to perform the <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> step required to produce the antigenic peptide described here...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric Incremental Sheet Forming (AISF) is {{a process}} for the {{flexible}} production of sheet metal parts. In AISF, a part is obtained as the sum of localized plastic deformations produced by a simple forming tool that, in most configurations, moves under CNC control. Flexible processes with low tooling effort like AISF are suitable for sectors with small lot sizes but premium products, e. g. for the aviation and the automotive sector. Four main process limits restrict the range of application of AISF and its take-up in industry. These are: (i) material thinning, (ii) limited geometrical accuracy, (iii) the process duration and (iv) the calculation time and accuracy of process modelling. Moreover, the material spectrum of AISF for structural parts is mostly restricted to cold workable materials like steel and aluminum. This paper presents some new investigations of incremental sheet forming combined with laser heating or stretch forming as possible hybrid approaches to o vercome the above mentioned limitations of AISF. These hybrid incremental sheet forming processes can increase the technological and economical potentials of AISF. A possible application is the fabrication of lightweight sheet metal parts as individual parts or small batches, e. g. for the aerospace industry.
