60|$|HYPATIA. I {{can imagine}} {{all sorts of}} men I could {{fall in love with}}; but I never seem to meet them. The real ones are too small, like Bunny, or too silly, like Jerry. Of course one can get into a state about any man: fall in love with him if you like to call it that. But who would risk marrying a man for love? I shouldnt. I {{remember}} three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never marry was the man you were in love with, because it would make a perfect slave of you. Theres a sort of instinct against it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>thats</b> just as strong as the other instinct. One of them, to my certain knowledge, refused a man she was in love with, and married another who was in love with her; and it turned out very well.|$|E
5000|$|I have a {{long history}} of using {{whatever}} is around...And it can be confused with being sort of the champion recycling guy and Im not. I just use whats around. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> actually a better idea of sustainability in the end. Michael Salter, an interview to The Register-Guard ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} shortly after {{stepping into the}} role as Chancellor, Davenport said of UT, “There is something special here about that great sense of pride in this institution and its traditions and I love that, and I feel it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> what carries me and carries all of us every day.” ...|$|E
50|$|Death follows me {{and life}} escapes me. When I go to sleep, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may never awake. When I wake up, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{may never get}} to sleep. When I go out, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may never come back.|$|R

But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> young lady crept out and saw him {{cleaning}} his pistol. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the old lady had a glimpse of the mask. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they can be made to say so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Lady Marrabel," [...] Saton said slowly, [...] "that you {{can tell}} me, if you will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you will tell me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you must!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Half-Life: Opposing Force, {{at the end}} of the game, Adrian Shephard {{is being}} transported in a {{helicopter}} away from Black Mesa, accompanied by G-Man. As G-Man says The biggest embarrassment has been Black Mesa facility, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> finally taken care of itself., there is a sudden flash of light visible, coming presumably from the direction of Black Mesa.|$|E
5000|$|... "I dont rehearse, but I do research. If Ive got {{an author}} on, Ill always read the book. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> the {{least you can}} do rather than just reading the {{researchers}} notes. I suppose I do so much research because I really love television. Thats why I work in it. Im passionate about it and I always have been." [...] Paul OGrady, on the show ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a further}} {{interview}} with Press Association, Scanlan said: [...] "I {{have never had}} the opportunity to play somebody as complex and as damaged as Brendan. He is without doubt a sociopathic, self-loathing, homophobic gay man and that in itself is a fascinating attraction for any actor to play. I think any actor would love a challenge, when youre doing a role if it pushes your boundaries and takes you out of yourself and allows you to experience different things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> great. So coming up to do the part was exciting for me." ...|$|E
60|$|Is {{it because}} he has {{captured}} the takingest name? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that {{is only a small}} part of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Rick Ross is resilient, and Meek Mill {{is a new}} hot rapper, who's really hot, one of my {{favorite}} new hip hop artists. Rick Ross, who's always been one of {{my favorite}}s, he's resilient. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> through the years, people try to count him out, and he always comes back, comes back harder, comes back with bigger and better records. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the theme of 'Triumphant,' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he fits the theme of that whole concept the best, really, because through it all, Rick Ross always comes out on top.|$|R
5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> one of the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mels characterisation: [...] "When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didnt want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, theyre either bitches or theyre slags or theyre victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. Its just working out where they come and go, and I dont think thats lack of continuity; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E
5000|$|Director Jonathan Demme has commented, [...] "Beloved only {{played in}} theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million dollars -- <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> {{a lot of}} money. And the only reason it left theaters after a month was because the Disney {{corporation}} that released the picture wanted all the Beloved theaters -- where we were doing very well, {{in a number of}} situations. The Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for Adam Sandlers Waterboy. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back {{at the end of the}} year, and they didnt. But the picture did very respectfully. It was in the top ten its whole life." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, {{seven years}} after the role made him famous, Oh reprised Hedwig for the rock musicals seventh run in Korea. At a press conference, he jokingly talked about shaving his legs again and being banned from his {{favorite}} activities like eating meat, working out, and drinking alcohol, but said that the role was [...] "certainly worth the ordeal." [...] Oh said, [...] "This musical tells us that to love someone is to accept him exactly the way he is. It also tells us that everyone deserves to be loved, and every individual is meaningful and important. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> the essential message of this piece." ...|$|E
5000|$|Springsteen {{had said}} that it was a song about how he felt in the times of George W. Bush. [...] "In that {{particular}} song a guy comes back to his town and recognizes nothing and is recognized by nothing," [...] Springsteen told The New York Times A. O. Scott. [...] "The singer in Long Walk Home, thats his experience. His world has changed. The things that he thought he knew, the people who he thought he knew, whose ideals he had something in common with, are like strangers. The world that he knew feels totally alien. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> whats happened in this country in the past six years." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This is a {{song about}} Adelaide and my upbringing. I namedropped lots of things that only Adelaide people know as well just because I felt like it. Ive done lots of music about being an outcast and feeling alienated in the past, so I {{wanted to do a}} happier song about being young. The song was {{produced}} by HAMLEY and basically stayed the same all the way through except the drums changed a little. I wrote the last verse when I was driving around in Adelaide, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> why the subject matter is kind of different to the other two verses. This is probably more boom bap {{than the rest of the}} album but its just so catchy I had to leave it on there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{count for}} a great deal," [...] she said. [...] "If you had not come to me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must have died.... If I were to lose you ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should die." ...|$|R
5000|$|Everybody is free {{to believe}} {{anything}} he wants to; <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Dave misunderstood the whole subject. I have met the guys from Rotting Christ and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are Satanists or something. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Dave overreacted on this.|$|R
5000|$|Howard Schmidt, an American {{cybersecurity}} expert, {{argued in}} March 2010 that [...] "there is no cyberwar... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{is a terrible}} metaphor and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chabons first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, {{was written}} as his UC Irvine masters thesis. Without telling Chabon, his professor, Donald Heiney (better known by his pen name, MacDonald Harris), {{sent it to}} a {{literary}} agent, who got the author an impressive $155,000 advance on the novel (most first-time novelists receive advances ranging from $5,000 to $7,500.) The Mysteries of Pittsburgh appeared in 1988 and became a bestseller, instantly catapulting Chabon {{to the status of}} literary celebrity. Among Chabons major literary influences in this period were Donald Barthelme, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Raymond Chandler, John Updike, Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As Chabon remarked in 2010, [...] "I just copied the writers whose voices I was responding to, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> probably the best way to learn." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the second}} time that David Carradine and Daryl Hannah have teamed up to do a Kung Fu film since {{appearing}} in Kill Bill. They teamed up again for Carradines posthumous release of Eldorado, where they would again get together again with another member of Kill Bills Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Michael Madsen. All three have been friends for a long while, and on his and Hannahs friendship as well as her character Carradine stated [...] " [...] Ive known Daryl Hannah for 20 years. Shes kind of a friend of the family. Anyway, Ive been hot for her ever since Blade Runner. It was great working with her on this. She plays a torch singer, and shes actually pretty good at it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> probably why she took the part, because she got to sing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Blasted is {{the first}} play by the British author Sarah Kane. It was first {{performed}} in 1995 at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in London. This performance was highly controversial and the play was fiercely attacked by most newspaper critics, many of whom regarded it as a rather immature attempt to shock the audience. However, critics have subsequently reassessed it; for example The Guardians Michael Billington, who savaged the play in his first review, later recanted {{in the wake of}} Kanes suicide: [...] "I got it wrong, as I keep saying. She was a major talent. Apparently, Harold Pinter said at her memorial service that she was a poet, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> dead right." [...] After seeing a revival of the play, an Evening Standard reviewer Annie Ferguson wrote [...] "How shrill and silly the 1995 hullabaloo and hysteria seemed last night when Blasted returned to the Royal Court. It is, and always was, a play with a fine, moral purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Object to you!" [...] she repeated. [...] "On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he rather approves of you. You {{saved his}} life, or {{something}} {{very much like}} it. He should be very grateful! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he is!" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{deep down}} {{everyone}} is not having fun right now. People {{are afraid of}} things, the world’s fucked, no one has any money, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this show is a document of friends having fun.--Jordan Kinley ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can love}} you as {{honestly}} and as firmly as a younger one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{if you could}} bring yourself to be my wife, you would find {{that you would not}} be treated badly." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} was stenciled by the {{graffiti}} artist Banksy. Despite Banksy stating that he normally avoids commercial work, he later defended {{his decision to}} do the cover, saying: [...] "Ive done {{a few things to}} pay the bills, and I did the Blur album. It was a good record and commission was quite a lot of money. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> a really important distinction to make. If its something you actually believe in, doing something commercial doesnt turn it to shit just because its commercial. Otherwise youve got to be a socialist rejecting capitalism altogether, because the idea that you can marry a quality product with a quality visual and {{be a part of that}} even though its capitalistic is sometimes a contradiction you cant live with. But sometimes its pretty symbiotic, like the Blur situation. The albums cover art sold at auction in 2007 for £75,000. The fold out booklet of the album features the text [...] "Celebrity Harvest" [...] which was the working name for a proposed, but ultimately unmade Gorillaz film.|$|E
5000|$|The Runners {{first met}} as {{toddlers}} in Vero Beach, Florida. Their fathers were both physicians {{and their families}} soon became fast friends. Dru and Mayne, both grew up with an interest for music. When Dru's family moved to North Carolina during his teen years, he and Mayne they lost touch with each other but both continued their musical interests separately. When they reunited through telephone, Dru and Mayne discovered they'd each been working with DJing and production. In 2000, They name themselves The Runners and {{set up shop in}} Orlando, where they launched Trac-N-Field Entertainment. In 2008, The Runners were nominated for Producer of the Year at the BET Awards. The Runners want to serve as the new Miami sound machine for an entire region. The Runners have been instrumental in the crafting the new hip-hop soundtrack of the 305. [...] "Were trying to give Miami that sound that Dre gave California, or certain producers gave Atlanta. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> what people are hearing in our records now", says Dru.|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think its timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically its heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the albums 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the bands thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E
