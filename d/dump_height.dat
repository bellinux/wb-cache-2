50|$|The digging phase {{consists}} of crowding the dipper into the bank, hoisting the dipper to fill it, then retracting the full dipper from the bank. The swinging phase occurs once the dipper is {{clear of the}} bank both vertically and horizontally. The operator controls the dipper through a planned swing path and <b>dump</b> <b>height</b> until it is suitably positioned over the haul unit (e.g. truck). Dumping involves opening the dipper door to dump the load, while maintaining the correct <b>dump</b> <b>height.</b> Returning is when the dipper swings back to the bank, and involves lowering the dipper into the tuck position to close the dipper door.|$|E

30|$|The slope {{geometry}} and the geo-mechanical strength of dump materials mostly control {{the stability of}} the dump [7, 19, 42]. Das [18] and McCurthy and David [41] asserted various factors responsible for failure of dump slopes such as geology and hydrogeology of the dumping area, gravitational force, seepage of water from dump to slope, lowering of water adjacent to a slope, changes of stress and erosion of dump (removal of lateral support) caused by flowing water. Other factors such as dump slope angle (slope inclination), natures of the dump materials (material properties), degree of compaction, <b>dump</b> <b>height</b> and changes in cohesion of interface materials have also been pointed by other workers [34, 48, 57].|$|E

Using a simple quantitative model, we analyse {{the effects of the}} linear interaction between tides and planetary waves on ion motion. Besides an expected variation of the <b>dumping</b> <b>height,</b> it is found that the boundaries of the oscillations induced by the descending semidiurnal tide are significantly modified by the presence of the planetary wave. The height variations of the ionisation cause planetary wave modulations of the metallic ion content in the background plasma density.

The fact that the <b>dumping</b> <b>height</b> variations are strongly influenced by the tidal phase velocity and amplitude, together with the variability of the metallic ion content, could contribute {{to the understanding of the}} sporadic nature of the E-layers...|$|R

Moreover, experiments with gravel were conducted {{based on the}} research site conditions. The geological conditions, dumping operation, and waste particle size distribution were investigated in the Heidaigou open pit mine. Particle size distribution, <b>dumping</b> <b>height,</b> <b>dumping</b> volume, and floor inclination were varied to examine their effects on a single pile formation. The design of blasting can be modified to make the particle size of waste smaller. The volume of the bucket {{does not have a}} pronounced ef-fect on dumping pile repose angle, capacity of dumping pile, and dumping area stability. The smal-ler the floor inclination, the better it is. Two measures are proposed to increase the kinetic force of friction between waste material and floor surface. The interval distance, dumping volume and <b>dumping</b> <b>height</b> were also varied to examine the interaction between the formations of multiple piles. The dumping width should be decided through optimization efficiency of bulldozer and dumping device in bucket wheel excavator-belt-stacker dumping operation and dragline dumping operation.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the usefulness of grass-legume mixture as an initial cover species to initiate ecorestoration process on a hazardous waste dump, produced by the wastes from an integrated sponge iron plant. During production of sponge iron huge amount of solid wastes are generated, which is considered as hazardous material, with alkaline pH; composed of dolochar, coal fines, slag and fly ash; posing {{serious threat to the}} surroundings. The area occupied by waste dump was approximately 5 ha and surface area; 3. 4 ha was located inside forests. The average <b>dump</b> <b>height</b> varied between 40 - 50 m with a steep slope greater than 70 o. Before ecorestoration work, dump was blanketed with a thick layer of topsoil (1 - 1. 2 m) and slope was covered by coir-mat followed by sowing of grass-legume seed mixture before monsoon onset. Dominant grass species was Pennisetum pedicellatum; drought tolerant and quick growing; while legume seeds consisted of Stylosanthes hamata, Sesbania sesban, and Crotalaria juncea. S. hamata is perennial, whereas C. juncea, S. sesban completes their life cycle within 5 - 6 months and their dead aerial parts contributed nitrogen rich litter to the soil. Dry subterranean parts of the annual grass P. pedicellatum acts as mulch. In a whole, it has been observed that grass-legume growth initiated nutrient cycling in hostile conditions, which was corroborated by analyzing rhizospheric soil samples of grass-legume cover at an interval of six-seven months. Study concluded that hazardous waste dump with steep slopes can be restored by application of grass-legume mixture, topsoiling and coir matting that leads to a sustainable plant soil interaction...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nano-specific {{inhalation}} exposure models {{could potentially}} be effective tools to assess and control worker exposure to nano-objects, and their aggregates and agglomerates (NOAA). However, {{due to the lack}} of reliable and consistent collected NOAA exposure data, the scientific basis for validation of the existing NOAA exposure models is missing or limited. The main objective of this study was to gain more insight into the effect of various determinants underlying the potential on the concentration of airborne NOAA close to the source with the purpose of providing a scientific basis for existing and future exposure inhalation models. Method: Four experimental studies were conducted to investigate the effect of 11 determinants of emission on the concentration airborne NOAA close to the source during dumping of ~ 100 % nanopowders. Determinants under study were: nanomaterial, particle size, dump mass, height, rate, ventilation rate, mixing speed, containment, particle surface coating, moisture content of the powder, and receiving surface. The experiments were conducted in an experimental room (19. 5 m 3) with well-controlled environmental and ventilation conditions. Particle number concentration and size distribution were measured using real-time measurement devices. Results: Dumping of nanopowders resulted in a higher number concentration and larger particles than dumping their reference microsized powder (P < 0. 05). Statistically significant more and larger particles were also found during dumping of SiO 2 nanopowder compared to TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 nanopowders. Particle surface coating did not affect the number concentration but on average larger particles were found during dumping of coated nanopowders. An increase of the powder's moisture content resulted in less and smaller particles in the air. Furthermore, the results indicate that particle number concentration increases with increasing <b>dump</b> <b>height,</b> rate, and mass and decreases when ventilation is turned on. Discussion: These results give an indication of the direction and magnitude of the effect of the studied determinants on concentrations close to the source and provide a scientific basis for (further) development of existing and future NOAA inhalation exposure models...|$|E

30|$|Therefore, after a {{thorough}} {{assessment of the}} slopes and materials of the tailing dumps, the authors recommended a number of precautions that could be beneficial {{in the design of}} tailing dumps for safe and durable storage. Effort should be made to avoid flooding within the mine perimeter, thereby reducing water level to as low as possible around and within the <b>dump</b> slope. Slope <b>height</b> and angle optimization must be a common cautious exercise in the design of tailing dump storage. Slopes with higher height and angle than the optimal and/or high groundwater level must undergo stabilization, using any affordable method such as the benching method. The method helps reduce high slope height and angle and also reduces sliding mass in the event of possible slope failure.|$|R
30|$|A spatial {{correlation}} between landslide occurrence and topographical concavity {{has been noted}} by Mugagga [46]. Igwe [27] also reported that positive correlation exist between frequency of landslide and slope angle, but however noted that landslides occur more on slopes with angles greater than 30 ° but less than 40 °. Thus slope geometry {{could be one of}} the causes of the shallow sliding on the slope surfaces shown in Fig.  1 b, since it presents moderate to high slope angles (35 °– 45 °). The <b>dump</b> slope geometry (<b>height,</b> width and angle) recorded in Table  5 were analyzed using a statistical method known as principal component analysis (PCA) to decipher which geometric components would have more influence on the stability of the dump slopes [11, 12, 24].
