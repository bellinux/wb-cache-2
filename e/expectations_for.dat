50|$|The very {{phenomenon}} of inattentional blindness {{is defined by}} a lack of <b>expectation</b> <b>for</b> the unattended stimulus. Some researchers believe that it is not inattention that produces blindness, but in fact the aforementioned lack of <b>expectation</b> <b>for</b> the stimuli. Proponents of this theory often state that classic methods for testing inattentional blindness are not manipulating attention per se, but instead the <b>expectation</b> <b>for</b> the presentation of a visual item.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{influence}} of future orientation training on student 2 ̆ 7 s future orientation improvement and relationship between future orientation and <b>expectation</b> <b>for</b> learning success. This study involved 37 of tenth grade students in one of private Senior High School in Semarang.

5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E

Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics.

5|$|<b>Expectations</b> <b>for</b> Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and again for a three-game stretch in December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E

In August 2012, she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> new moms, set by celebrities.

5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Burnout 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing Burnout 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere in the creative process. Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the Burnout series; their high <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> Burnout 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E

5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
5|$|The dump {{months are}} what the film {{community}} calls the two periods {{of the year}} when there are lowered commercial and critical <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller {{than the rest of the}} year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's <b>expectations</b> <b>for</b> drugs that most of that population cannot afford.
