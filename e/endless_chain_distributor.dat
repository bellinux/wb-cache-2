5000|$|Finally, {{the most}} {{advanced}} systems involved continuous loops of rope operated like a cable car system. Some mines used <b>endless</b> <b>chains</b> before wire-rope became widely available. [...] The <b>endless</b> <b>chain</b> system originated in the mines near Burnley (England) around 1845. An endless rope system was developed in Nottinghamshire around 1864, and another independently developed near Wigan somewhat later (also in England). [...] In these systems, individual cars or trains within the mine could {{be connected to the}} cable by a grip comparable to the grips used on surface cable car systems. [...] In some mines, the haulage chain or cable went {{over the top of the}} cars, and cars were released automatically when the chain or cable was lifted away by an overhead pulley. Where the cable ran under the cars, a handheld grip could be used, where the grip operator would ride on the front car of the train working the grip chained to the front of the car. In some cases, a separate grip car was coupled to the head of the train. [...] At the dawn of the 20th century, endless rope haulage was the dominant haulage technology for the main haulage ways of underground mines.|$|R

50|$|The {{chain pump}} is {{type of a}} water pump in which several {{circular}} discs are positioned on an <b>endless</b> <b>chain.</b> One part of the chain dips into the water, and the chain runs through a tube, slightly bigger than {{the diameter of the}} discs. As the chain is drawn up the tube, water becomes trapped between the discs and is lifted to and discharged at the top. Chain pumps were used for centuries in the ancient Middle East, Europe, China, and ancient Egypt.|$|R

Later an <b>endless</b> <b>chain</b> was used which drove the cap through gearing.
