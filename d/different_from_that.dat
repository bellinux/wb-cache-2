The game is whimsical in tone, with various in-game jokes and comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1.

5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside {{synchronous}} orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition {{or a combination of}} Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
