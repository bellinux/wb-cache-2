5|$|In November 2009, a local street, Durant Avenue, {{was renamed}} to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor. Incidentally, {{following}} the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> {{doing the same}} for Timoshenko. However, the latter case had attracted much less media attention.|$|E
5|$|Keeler faced sharp {{criticism}} for {{his handling of}} accusations of sexual abuse against the Rev. Maurice J. Blackwell, who was accused by Dontee D. Stokes of sexual abuse in 1993. Keeler first suspended the priest but later reinstated the priest as pastor of St. Edward in Baltimore, overruling a lay panel that <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> against reinstatement.|$|E
50|$|The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission <b>has</b> <b>recommended</b> {{extending}} {{protection for}} Maui's dolphin further south to Whanganui and further offshore to 20 nmi from the coastline.

5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> Hindawi to Syrian intelligence. Seale {{writes that}} the bomb had been {{manufactured}} by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, {{and at first}} was {{regarded}} with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon his squad was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> him for a battlefield commission.|$|E
5|$|Knox, in his 1866 report, <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> a {{thorough}} {{revision of the}} laws pertaining to the Mint, and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director Henry Linderman, who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of the Mint.|$|E

5|$|On 17 November 1994 the USAF {{announced}} that Colwell <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive nonjudicial administrative {{action on the}} dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2010, WMATA {{adopted a}} six-year capital {{spending}} plan totalling $5 billion. The plan is funded by the $3 billion from the 2008 Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and increased funding from the participating jurisdictions. The plan includes rebuilding much of its infrastructure for improved safety. The NTSB <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> replacing Metrorail's oldest series of railcars as not crashworthy, and the spending plan would replace those cars.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> Fernández to {{the coach}} of his alma mater, Fran Dunphy. Dunphy {{dispatched}} assistant Matt Langel to recruit Fernández to Temple. On one recruiting trip, Langel drove for 10 hours on the backroads of Argentina searching for Fernández, who was practicing with the national team instead of home in Rio Tercero as Langel had thought. After his official visit to the Philadelphia campus in September 2008, Fernández signed his letter of intent. He graduated high school in December, and enrolled at Temple.|$|E

5|$|The Who's {{first attempt}} to record the song was at the Record Plant on W 44 Street, New York City, on 16 March 1971. Manager Kit Lambert <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> the studio to the group, which led to his {{producer}} credit, though the de facto work was done by Felix Pappalardi. This take featured Pappalardi's Mountain band mate, Leslie West, on lead guitar.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the {{position}} went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E

5|$|Although Marshall <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch {{officers}} to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did not wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, {{and that the only}} outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E

5|$|In February 1946, Shaughnessy {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} return to Maryland amidst mounting criticism at Pittsburgh, which included the threat of resignation from assistant coaches Charles Hartwig, Bobby Hoel and Stan Olenn. University of Maryland president Dr. H. C. Byrd, himself a former football coach, called Shaughnessy one of the top-three coaches in the nation. Shaughnessy complained {{that he was not}} given a fair chance to succeed at Pittsburgh and that controversy over his role with the Redskins was without basis. The Pittsburgh athletic board <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> Shaughnessy be retained as coach if he resigned from the Redskins, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|In total, the Māori Battalion {{received}} more individual bravery decorations {{than any other}} New Zealand battalion. One member of the battalion, Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu, was awarded the Victoria Cross during the war, while another member, Sergeant Haane Manahi, was also recommended for the award. During the fighting around Takrouna in 1943, Manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of Italian positions; the following day {{he set out to}} capture Italian outposts. Four generals, including Harold Alexander, Bernard Freyberg, Howard Kippenberger and Bernard Law Montgomery <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> that Manahi receive the Victoria Cross but this recommendation was downgraded in London to the Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts {{to blow the}} hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts <b>had</b> <b>recommended</b> changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E
