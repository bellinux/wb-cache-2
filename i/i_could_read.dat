5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|Having {{completed}} work on Ulysses, Joyce was {{so exhausted}} {{that he did}} not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he wrote a letter to his patron, Harriet Weaver: [...] "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> them." [...] This is the earliest reference to what would become Finnegans Wake.|$|E

[...] Thus was born a text that became known, first, as Work in Progress and later Finnegans Wake.|$|E

500|$|A {{military}} brat, Douglas MacArthur {{was born}} 26 January 1880, at Little Rock Barracks, Little Rock, Arkansas, to Arthur MacArthur, Jr., a U.S. Army captain, and his wife, Mary Pinkney Hardy MacArthur (nicknamed [...] "Pinky"). Arthur, Jr. {{was the son}} of Scottish-born jurist and politician Arthur MacArthur, Sr., Arthur would later receive the Medal of Honor for his actions with the Union Army in the Battle of Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War, and be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Pinkney came from a prominent Norfolk, Virginia, family. Two of her brothers had fought for the South in the Civil War, and refused to attend her wedding. Arthur and Pinky had three sons, of whom Douglas was the youngest, following Arthur III, born on 1 August 1876, and Malcolm, born on 17 October 1878. The family lived on a succession of Army posts in the American Old West. Conditions were primitive, and Malcolm died of measles in 1883. In his memoir, Reminiscences, MacArthur wrote [...] "I learned to ride and shoot even before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> or write—indeed, almost before I could walk and talk." ...|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{left the}} boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't know if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> or write. Said {{you look like a}} big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E

60|$|Fortunately <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{answer this}} {{question}} in the affirmative; having studied French under a Frenchman, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak the language intelligibly though not fluently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> also <b>read</b> it well, and write it decently.|$|R
2500|$|She {{added that}} some of the {{technology}} on Space: 1999 has come to pass: [...] "We made up a scanning device for Dr Russell. Someone would simply be lying on the floor half dead, and I would [...] with this funny little thing that was a prop. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read</b> all his vital signs. They can pretty much do that [...] nowadays. There were times that we were playing with props that didn't read anything — I just had a bunch of dialogue to say after. We had the Commlock. All of those things {{were on the verge of}} happening anyway. Now we're way past it. When we made it, 1999 seemed so far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>read,</b> but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

60|$|As soon as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> after <b>reading</b> Alice's letter, I {{went down}} to Eberwich {{to see how things}} were. Memories of the old days came over me again till my heart hungered for its old people.|$|R

60|$|She {{looked at}} me for a spell in silence. Her back was to the light and her face in shadow, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> what passed there. Then, very slowly, like one utterly weary, she got to her feet.|$|R

60|$|He {{stared at}} them and turned pale. His hand groped for his dagger till he saw that mine was on the hilt of Wave-Flame, whereon he let it fall. Next the thought took him that in truth <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>read</b> the knots which he began to {{interpret}} falsely.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very strange}} night, silent, with a heavy, stirless air.
