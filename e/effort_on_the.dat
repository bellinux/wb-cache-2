5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence.

This upset {{the balance of power in}} the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E

In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty {{was replaced by a}} stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
5|$|McCool {{returned}} on the March 30, 2007 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, where she {{participated in a}} 10-Diva tag team match with Victoria, Melina, Kristal, and Jillian Hall in a losing <b>effort.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> April 13 episode of SmackDown!, McCool became a fan favorite again, {{when she came to}} the aid of Ashley after she was attacked by Jillian Hall backstage. Subsequently, a series of matches took place between Victoria and McCool, including a mixed tag team match where Victoria and Kenny Dykstra defeated McCool and Chuck Palumbo. On the November 13 episode of ECW, McCool formed an alliance with Kelly Kelly, and the duo were defeated Melina and Layla. On the December 12 episode of ECW, McCool saved Kelly from an attack by Victoria and Layla.|$|E
5|$|The Christian {{conversion}} of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the {{conversion of}} {{a significant portion of}} the population. Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and traditional religious beliefs regained preeminence; at least one major historic church in the area was burned. French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities. This was soon followed by a renewed <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E

However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London {{to assist with the}} inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{arrived in}} the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000. Bethe's {{appointment}} {{was part of a}} deliberate <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the new head of its physics department, Roswell Clifton Gibbs, to move into nuclear physics. Gibbs had hired Stanley Livingston, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence, to build a cyclotron at Cornell. To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited Robert Bacher. Bethe received requests to visit Columbia University from Isidor Isaac Rabi, Princeton University from Edward Condon, University of Rochester from Lee DuBridge, Purdue University from Karl Lark-Horovitz, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from Francis Wheeler Loomis, and Harvard University from John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow.|$|E

On the October 11 episode of WWE Smackdown, Kenny and Mikey took on Dolph Ziggler in a 2-on-1 Handicap match; Ziggler won but was then attacked by The Miz and saved by Rhyno and Heath Slater. On October 18th, Kenny and Mikey and the Miz defeated Dolph Ziggler, Heath Slater & Rhyno in a six man tag team match where Kenny pinned Slater.

5|$|With his {{original}} NHL contract expiring in the off-season, Kariya and the Ducks struggled {{to agree on}} a new deal. As a result, Kariya missed the first 32 games of the 1997–98 campaign. After making $2.1 million the previous season, he was reportedly asking for a three-year deal worth $27 million, while the Ducks countered with five-year, $25 million and seven-year, $49 million contracts. Both sides eventually agreed on a two-year, $14 million deal in December 1997. While the initial year of the contract paid Kariya a pro-rated salary of $5.5 million (it was also agreed in contract negotiations that Kariya would donate $2 million of his first year's salary to Orange County charities), the second year of the contract paid him $8.5 million, making him the second-highest paid player in League history (behind Mario Lemieux's $11 million salary in 1996–97). During his absence from the Ducks, Kariya trained with the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Due to the contract impasse, he missed an opportunity to play in his father's home country, Japan, as the Mighty Ducks opened the season with a two-game series against the Vancouver Canucks in Tokyo—an <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NHL's part to attract attention to the sport ahead of the Olympics. In his first game back, he recorded two goals and two assists, helping the Mighty Ducks rally from a three-goal deficit to beat the Washington Capitals 6–4. During the second period of the contest, he took a team record seven shots on goal.|$|E
