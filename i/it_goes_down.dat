25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the first}} two arcade games of the series, players have a power meter, located {{on the bottom of the}} screen. The meter fills up as the player lands punches against the opponent, and <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> as the player gets hit. When the power meter fills up completely, the player will be able to launch {{knockout}} punches such as uppercuts, hooks, and rapid punches. These punches have a slight delay in execution, but they cause more damage to the opponent. Players can also build power as the match progresses, as indicated by the background color behind the player's face on the upper left corner of the screen, which goes from blue to green to yellow to red. The player reaches [...] "Power-Up" [...] status when the background color reaches red. During this status, the player's punch speed and power increase. They lose their Power-Up status if they are knocked down.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, Goldmann and Reform Rabbi Stephen S. Wise {{established}} the World Jewish Congress (WJC).

Presently breakfast was announced, and we all went below very bravely and ranged {{ourselves}} about the table. Before the meal was half over, the Captain and the Doctor's were left in solitary state to finish it alone.
