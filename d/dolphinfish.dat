However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, <b>dolphinfish,</b> marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and <b>dolphinfish,</b> but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|The shark {{spends most}} of its time in the upper layer of the oceanto a depth of and prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to {{longline}} capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. Occasionally, it is found close to land, in waters as shallow as , mainly around midocean islands such as Hawaii, or {{in areas where the}} continental shelf is narrow with access to nearby deep water. It is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. Unlike many animals, it does not have a diurnal cycle, and is active both day and night. Its swimming style is slow, with widely spread pectoral fins. Despite its habitual isolation from members of its own species, pilot fish, <b>dolphinfish,</b> and remora may accompany it. In 1988, Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale.|$|E

500|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{exists in}} some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop {{secondary sexual characteristics}} that increase their chances of reproductive success. In <b>dolphinfish,</b> males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead parrotfish has a more well-developed forehead with an [...] "ossified ridge" [...] which {{plays a role in}} ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in killifishes, rainbowfishes and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, sticklebacks, darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.|$|E

50|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} feeding ecology of the pelagic thresher. Its very slender tail and fine dentition suggest an exclusive diet of small, pelagic prey. Analysis of stomach contents reveal that pelagic threshers feed mainly on barracudinas, lightfishes, and escolars, all inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone. Therefore, little competition occurs between the pelagic thresher and other large oceanic piscivores such as billfishes, tunas, and <b>dolphinfishes,</b> which tend to feed near the surface. As in other threshers, pelagic threshers may swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass, before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. Because of this behavior, pelagic threshers are often hooked on longlines by their tails.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shapes and}} {{proportional}} sizes of the otoliths vary with fish species. In general, fish from highly structured habitats such as reefs or rocky bottoms (e.g. snappers, groupers, many drums and croakers) will have larger otoliths than fish that {{spend most of}} their time swimming at high speed in straight lines in the open ocean (e.g. tuna, mackerel, <b>dolphinfish).</b> Flying fish have unusually large otoliths, possibly due to their need for balance when launching themselves out of the water to [...] "fly" [...] in the air. Often, the fish species can be identified from distinct morphological characteristics of an isolated otolith.|$|E

40|$|Various {{factors may}} impact the {{processes}} of diversification of a clade. In the marine realm, {{it has been shown}} that coral reef environments have promoted diversification in various fish groups. With the exception of requiem sharks, all the groups showing a higher level of diversity in reefs than in non-reef habitats have diets based predominantly on plankton, algae or benthic invert- ebrates. Here we explore the pattern of diversification of carangoid fishes, a clade that includes numerous piscivorous species (e. g. trevallies, jacks and <b>dolphinfishes),</b> using time-calibrated phylogenies as well as ecological and morphological data from both extant and fossil species. The study of caran- goid morphospace suggests that reef environments played a role in their early radiation during the Eocene. However, contrary to the hypothesis of a reef-association-promoting effect, we show that habitat shifts to non-reef environments have increased the rates of morphological diversification (i. e. size and body shape) in extant carangoids. Piscivory did not have a major impact on the tempo of diversification of this group. Through the ecological radiation of carangoid fishes, we demonstrate that non-reef environments may sustain and promote processes of diversification of different marine fish groups, at least those including a large proportion of piscivorous species.

40|$|Bycatch {{taken by}} the tuna purse-seine fishery from the Indian Ocean pelagic {{ecosystem}} was estimated from data collected by scientific observers aboard Soviet purse seiners in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) during 1986 – 92. A total of 494 sets on free-swimming schools, whale-shark-associated schools, whale-associated schools, and log-associated schools were analyzed. More than 40 fish species and other marine animals were recorded. Among them only two species, yellow-fin and skipjack tunas, were target species. Average levels of bycatch were 0. 518 metric tons (t) per set, and 27. 1 t per 1000 t of target species. The total annual purse-seine catch of yellowfin and skipjack tunas by principal fishing nations in the WIO during 1985 – 94 was 118, 000 – 277, 000 t. Nonrecorded annual bycatch for this period was estimated at 944 – 2270 t of pelagic oceanic sharks, 720 – 1877 t of rainbow runners, 705 – 1836 t of <b>dolphinfishes,</b> 507 – 1322 t of triggerfishes, 113 – 294 t of wahoo, 104 – 251 t of billfishes, 53 – 112 t of mobulas and mantas, 35 – 89 t of mackerel scad, 9 – 24 t of barracudas, and 67 – 174 t of other fishes.

40|$|The {{identification}} and mitigation of {{adverse effects of}} the bycatch of tuna longline fishery have been mainly developed and implemented for seabirds, sharks and turtles and, the knowledge on teleost bycatch for this fishery, remains very poor. This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing {{the fate of the}} catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean. Teleosts caught by the tuna longline fishery was segregated into three main groups: (1) the fast growing species represented mainly by <b>dolphinfishes</b> (Coryphaena hippurus and C. equisellis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), snoek (Thyrsites atun) and blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus); (2) target tunas and most other bycatch species which were part of an intermediate group and (3) billfishes including swordfish representing the large and slow growing species with moderate to high market values and unknown or highly uncertain stock status. Investment in some key life history traits (such as growth coefficient) and the development of quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches (stock assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment) should be priorized as precautionary management measures for these species...|$|R
40|$|The Echeneoidea {{comprise}} three famiUes of cosmopoUtan tropical/subtropical marine fishes: the Echeneidae (remoras), Coryphaenidae (<b>dolphinfishes),</b> and Rachycentridae (cobia). Complete nucleotide sequences {{from the}} mitochondrial 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, protein-coding ND 2, and nuclear ITS- 1 gene regions {{were used to}} reconstruct the phylogenetic history of these fishes. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of combined data sets resolved trees of similar topology. Congruent with evolutionary hypotheses based on larval morphology, a monophyletic Rachycentridae + Coryphaenidae was resolved with high support. Within a monophyletic Echeneidae, the subfamilies Echeneinae and Remorinae were monophyletic. In agreement with recent morphological analyses, the genus Remora was paraphyletic based on the position of Remorina albescens Temminck and Schlegel, 1850. Consistent resolution within the Remorinae using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference was not achieved with the gene regions surveyed in this study. The superfamily Echeneoidea comprises three of the 160 famiUes that are tradi-tionally placed in the order Perciformes: the Echeneidae, Coryphaenidae, and Rachy-centridae (Nelson, 2006). The Echeneoidea has been grouped with the Carangidae (jacks, pompanos) and the Nematistiidae (roosterfish) {{on the basis of}} prenasal canal ossification and scale structure (Freihofer, 1978). Collectively, these five families make up the suborder Carangoidei (Johnson, 1984; Springer and Smith-Vaniz, 2008). The carangids and echeneoids form a monophyletic group based on three features: these fishes lack the bony stay posterior to the ultimate dorsal and anal pterygiophores, possess two prenasal canal units, and bear a lamellar expansion of the coracoid. Sy-napomorphies that unite the Rachycentridae, Coryphaenidae, and the Echeneidae include absence of supraneural bones, an anterior shift of the first dorsal pterygio-phore, presence of several anal pterygiophores anterior to the first haemal spine, loss of the beryciform foramen in the ceratohyal, tubular ossifications surrounding both prenasal canal units, and elongate larvae with late dorsal fin completion (Johnson...|$|R
40|$|Flyingfishes are an {{essential}} component of pelagic food webs, serving as both predator and prey. Many pelagic fishes (billfishes, <b>dolphinfishes,</b> and tunas) consume large quantities of flyingfish, and several studies have documented their importance as prey for apex predators residing in coastal and offshore environments. Six summer ichthyoplankton cruises were conducted from 2009 to 2011 to investigate ocean influences on the distribution and abundance of flyingfish larvae in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). Over the three-year sampling period, a total 9, 533 bluntnose flyingfish (Prognichthys occidentalis) larvae were collected and this species alone accounted for 77 % of the total flyingfish catch. The remainder of the flyingfish assemblage was comprised of 8 species from 4 different genera (Cheilopogon, Hirundichthys, Exocoetus, and Parexocoetus), but given the dominance of bluntnose flyingfish our assessment of distribution, abundance, and habitat associations focused on this species. Interannual variation was detected with densities of bluntnose flyingfish larvae higher in 2009 and 2010 (11. 3 and 7. 9 larvae 1000 m^(- 2), respectively) than 2011 (1. 9 larvae 1000 m^(- 2)). Bluntnose flyingfish larvae were present in each month and year sampled, and percent frequency of occurrence ranged from 40 % in July 2011 to 100 % in June 2010, suggesting that this species is a common and important component of the ichthyoplankton assemblage in this region. Generalized additive models were used to evaluate the effect of oceanographic conditions on the abundance of bluntnose flyingfish, and several environmental variables (sea surface height anomaly, distance to Loop Current, and salinity) were found to be influential in explaining patterns of abundance. Habitat suitability was linked to physicochemical properties of the seawater, and higher larval abundances were found at higher salinities and negative sea surface heights. In addition, a positive relationship with distance to the dominant mesoscale oceanographic feature in the NGoM (Loop Current) was detected, suggesting that the abundance of bluntnose flyingfish larvae increases away from this frontal feature. This study emphasizes the importance of NGoM as a spawning/nursery area of bluntnose flyingfish, and suggests that oceanographic conditions {{play an important role in}} determining their distribution and abundance in this region...|$|R
