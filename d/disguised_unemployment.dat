25|$|Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic (<b>disguised)</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Government {{schemes that}} target {{eradication}} of both poverty and unemployment – which {{in recent decades}} has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt {{to solve the problem}} by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and created political pressure for further reforms. India's labour regulations are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts have urged the government to abolish or modify them {{in order to make the}} environment more conducive for employment generation. The 11th five-year plan has also identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment generation, by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.|$|E

40|$|Official {{statistics}} {{record a}} tremendous {{diversity in the}} level and dynamics of the self-employment rate across countries. Such diversity is even more pronounced for developing countries than for industrial countries. In these countries, self-employment figures may represent evidence of the spark of an emerging entrepreneurial class still in its infant stages, or conceal marginal urban manufacturing employment at the mere level of subsistence and <b>disguising</b> actual <b>unemployment</b> in years of economic depression. This paper documents this diversity for developing and developed countries with new empirical evidence, and tests the determinants of this diversity with econometric techniques. Estimates are presented on a sample of 64 developing countries and 19 developed countries in a period from the 1960 s through the 1990 s. The results generally confirm a negative association between the rate of self-employment and the stage of development: self-employment would tend to disappear with the development process. However, we present evidence suggesting {{that in some cases}} self-employment is also related to high value-added manufactured exports, representing a dynamic and emerging form of entrepreneurship. To this aim, self-employment would not be motivated by the desire to evade taxes, but rather an active role of the government may enhance it. The relationships with the development of the financial sector, educational levels, and other cultural factors tend to vary. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

These topics are ones that have: (1) received relatively great attention in developing countries compared to developed economies (i. e., family enterprises, missing labor markets, geographical mobility, health/nutrition effects on productivity) because of their greater importance in developing countries; (2) been considered more extensively for developing than developed labor markets because the nature of institutions, behaviors and available data permit more extensive empirical examination of these topics (i. e., labor adjustments to shocks {{in the presence of}} imperfect markets, information problems in labor markets), and (3) been considered extensively for both developing and developed economies but with some different approaches and results for part of the developing country literature (e. g., determinants of and labor market returns to schooling). The discussion is organized around five broad topics: (1) The household enterprise model, surplus labor, <b>disguised</b> employment and <b>unemployment,</b> complete markets and separability, and labor supplies; (2) labor contracts, risks and incentives; (3) determinants of and returns to human capital investments (including health and nutrition in addition to schooling); (4) urban labor markets, labor-market regulations, international trade policies and manufacturing; and (5) distribution and mobility. ...|$|R

Up to the mid 1970 s {{there was a}} trend towards greater regional equality {{in the distribution of}} income and wealth in the UK. However, over the last 25 years regional inequality has increased, as have other forms of inequality. Growing inequality has been associated with a more difficult labour market. The growing gap between a prosperous Inner Region Core {{and the rest of the}} UK is <b>disguised</b> in the <b>unemployment</b> statistics because of a powerful discouraged worker effect in the less prosperous regions. This paper seeks to explore why regional convergence has been replaced by divergence and argues that if spatial imbalances continue, then they are likely to add to inflationary pressures in the UK that may be detrimental to the growth of national output.

40|$|The 16 {{publications}} {{included in}} this thesis are {{the results of a}} programme of research between 1993 and 2009 into the labour market and labour market-related impacts of the large-scale spatially concentrated losses of industrial jobs in Great Britain from the 1970 s to the 1990 s. The British conventional wisdom has been that labour market recovery was relatively quick, and that the effects were not particularly profound. Continuing labour market distress was mainly ascribed to labour ‘supply-side’ factors rather than to locally deficient labour demand. The research challenges these views. It draws particularly on the British Keynesian tradition, and on authors such as J. F. Kain, John Kasarda and William Julius Wilson from the USA, which experienced similar job losses around a decade earlier. Issues covered include the statistical measurement and spatial variation of unemployment and related economic disadvantage, <b>unemployment</b> <b>disguised</b> as sickness, long-term unemployment, migration and lone parenthood, and there is also analysis of policies on employment and social inclusion. The research shows that ‘Travel-to-Work Areas’ (TTWAs) do not correctly identify the employment ‘fields’ of residents of areas of high unemployment. They have biased errors due to imbalance between commuting inflows and outflows, and obscure the main variation in unemployment on the urban-rural dimension. Three papers on Incapacity Benefit (IB) analyse the dynamics of change in the stock of claimants, investigating the roles played by health status and labour market conditions. The most recent of these papers examines whether the striking fall in IB claims in Glasgow and other former industrial areas in 2003 - 08 was the result of official interventions or of improving labour market conditions, concluding that it was mainly the latter. A key ‘supply-side’ assumption was that being unemployed in itself makes people less ‘employable’ – the theory of ‘state-dependence’. The paper on long-term unemployment radically challenges this interpretation. It points out that the literature on the relationship between long-term and short-term unemployment has generally failed to consider the appropriate time-lags or the behaviour of the standard measure of long-term unemployment. It shows that the phenomenon which the theory of state-dependence purports to explain does not occur to any significant extent. Outmigration and housing abandonment are significant effects of local job loss. The paper on housing abandonment demonstrates a statistical relationship across England in 1997 between social housing surplus and ‘real unemployment’, while a further paper challenges the view that there was no longer a deficiency of demand for labour in Glasgow and the Clyde Valley in the 1990 s by investigating migration patterns. It demonstrates that net flows between individual Scottish areas {{and the rest of the}} UK were to a substantial extent determined by changes in labour demand. A new finding is that little adjustment to employment change occurs through migration within Scotland. The large increase in lone parenthood in Great Britain since the 1960 s has been strongly correlated across areas with male worklessness. The US literature suggested that this relationship is causal, and this thesis is investigated in two papers. The earlier of these was the first comprehensive published application of this interpretation to the modern British case. A further paper concludes that falling male employment accounted for around half the rise in lone parenthood in Great Britain in 1971 - 2001. Two of the papers present a comprehensive picture of the geographical distributions of the different groups of disadvantaged people in the labour market, showing that they all conform to a similar pattern which in turn is related to deficient labour demand.

50|$|Higgins {{notes that}} the problem of <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> has become more and more serious in the rural sector during the last two centuries. This {{happened}} as technological progress took a form of capital intensive sector and not technological progress took place in agriculture, handicrafts. The technological progress has been rapid in modern sector. Particularly after the second world war both he trade union activity and direct government intervention has led to increase in the industrial wage rates in certain countries but these policies have had no effect on the rural wage rate. As a result the tendency towards technological dualism has increased.|$|E
5000|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{does not always}} provide much support for the Lewis model. Theodore Schultz in an empirical study of a village in India during the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 showed that agricultural output declined, although his study does not prove whether output would have declined had a comparable proportion of the agricultural population left for other occupations in response to economic incentive. Again <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> may be present in one {{sector of the economy}} but not in others. Further, empirically {{it is important to know}} not only whether the marginal productivity is equal to zero, but also the amount of surplus labor and the effect of its withdrawal on output.|$|E
5000|$|The {{average size}} of land {{holdings}} {{is very small}} (less than 2 hectares) and is subject to fragmentation due to land ceiling acts, and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> and low productivity of labour. Some reports claim smallholder farming may not be cause of poor productivity, since the productivity is higher in China and many developing economies even though China smallholder farmers constitute over 97% of its farming population. A Chinese smallholder farmer is able to rent his land to larger farmers, China's organised retail and extensive Chinese highways are able to provide the incentive and infrastructure necessary to its farmers for sharp increases in farm productivity.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{relationship}} between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the output per head of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited.This gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the existing wage rate.A large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth.|$|E
5000|$|After AD, MP {{begins to}} rise, and {{industrial}} labor rises {{from zero to}} a value equal to AD. AP of agricultural labor is shown by BYZ {{and we see that}} this curve falls downward after AD. This fall in AP {{can be attributed to the}} fact that as agricultural laborers shift to the industrial sector, the real wage of industrial laborers decreases due to shortage of food supply, since less laborers are now working in the food sector. The decrease in the real wage level decreases the level of profits, and the size of surplus that could have been re-invested for more industrialization. However, as long as surplus exists, growth rate can still be increased without a fall in the rate of industrialization. This re-investment of surplus can be graphically visualized as the shifting of MP curve outwards. In Phase2 the level of <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> is given by AK. This allows the agricultural sector to give up a part of its labor-force until ...|$|E
50|$|Initially this {{absorption}} {{takes place}} by getting more {{land under cultivation}} so as to keep the ratio of labour to land constant. For sometime the capital and labour combination remain constant as the output rises from O1 to O3 as given in Figure 2. As resources are not unlimited the good land tends to become scarce and due to inflow of labour the ratio of labour to capital in the sector rises and hence the techniques tend to become increasingly labour-intensive. When the point On is reached all the available land has already been cultivated due to the high intensive labour techniques used and the {{marginal productivity of labour}} falls below zero. <b>Disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> starts making an appearance at this point. Under these condition there is no incentive for farmers to or small industries to make an investment in this sector even if they have the money to invest. Nor will they be interested in introducing labour saving innovations even if they knew about them. Since labour supply is in excess therefore labour as a group is not interested in increasing their efforts. Thus methods of production remain labour-intensive and economic and social welfare remain low.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{drawbacks}} of the Lewis model was the undermining {{of the role of}} agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in productivity of labor should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei-Ranis dual economy model of three growth stages. They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural developmentIn Phase 1 of the Fei-Ranis model, the elasticity of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Also, the marginal product of labor is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model.In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages.|$|E

It {{has been argued that}} the Chinese urban industrial enterprises and workers have few incentives to be productive. The major objectives of this study are; (1) {{to determine the extent of}} industrial enterprise inefficiency and <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment,</b> (2) to relate these to government policies of state ownership, full employment and egalitarian wages, and (3) to make feasible suggestions concerning further economic reform. The methodology of this study, which combines a stochastic frontier production function and efficiency wage theory into a Zellner-Revankar generalized production function framework, is innovative, especially for analysis of the Chinese economy. Micro enterprise-level data from the 1985 Chinese Industrial Census were employed. This study found that there are substantial enterprise inefficiency and <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> within the Chinese urban industrial sector. On average, enterprise efficiency is approximately 20 percent below the best-practiced production frontier, and about 22 percent of the employees in the Chinese large and medium urban industrial enterprises are redundant. This study found two stylized facts about the Chinese urban industrial sector. First, within a specific industry, medium collective-owned enterprises exhibit the best performance, having the lowest enterprise inefficiency rates, lowest <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates and highest elasticities of returns to scale. Large collective-owned enterprises are second best, followed by medium state-owned enterprises. Large state-owned enterprises operate most inefficiently. Secondly, across industries, on average, the labor-intensive industries have better performances than the capital-intensive industries. The major cause of these stylized facts is the existence and intensity of the Chinese government's centrally planned economic policies of state ownership, full employment and egalitarian wages. This study also found that efficiency wage theory can play an important role in stimulating labor productivity growth and overall economic development on the "average" production technology.

Labour hoarding was {{prevalent in the}} 1960 s after the absorption of post-capitalist labour reserves. The pattern was similar in almost all East European Central Planned Economies (CPEs), but the nature of labour hoarding was different from market economies, where it is usually confined to smoothing adjustments over the business cycle. The paper contains an estimate of labour hoarding in Polish industry based on a Cobb-Douglas production function of the type employed earlier by Denison. A part of the residual factor of labour productivity growth that reflects underutilization of labour is used to derive estimates for labour hoarding. The results show a huge increase in labour hoarding (<b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate) in Polish industry from less than 5 per cent of the labour force in the late 1960 s {{up to more than}} 25 per cent in the late 1980 s.

40|$|A {{common theme}} in the {{analysis}} of the contemporary Chinese economy is that the Chinese state owned enterprises fail to operate efficiently because of ambiguous property rights, soft budget constraints, and government intervention. These authors advocate an economic reform program based on large-scale privatization. This dissertation advances an alternative perspective on the state owned enterprises. ^ In the first essay, I argue that the state owned enterprises have made an important contribution to China 2 ̆ 7 s macroeconomic stability. This view draws from Hyman Minsky 2 ̆ 7 s argument that a large government sector is indispensable for a capitalist market economy to maintain macroeconomic stability and avoid deep recessions. I argue that in the Chinese context, the state owned enterprise sector must be sufficiently large so that public sector investment accounts for about 50 percent of the total capital formation. ^ In the second essay, I argue that the performance of the state owned enterprises can be enhanced by promoting workers 2 ̆ 7 participation in management. I conducted a survey of workers 2 ̆ 7 participation in management in large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in China 2 ̆ 7 s Henan province. Using the data collected from this survey, I performed econometric analyses to explore the relationship between workers 2 ̆ 7 participation and firm performance, finding evidence that participation does improve performance. ^ The third essay addresses what is now termed “disguised unemployment” in the state owned enterprises. The existing literature argues that the state owned enterprises fail to use their labor force efficiently. In this view, a high percentage of workers in state owned enterprises are redundant and unemployed in a disguised manner. These workers have to be laid off for the sake of efficiency. I argue that much of the <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the state sector may be due to insufficient aggregate demand rather than technical inefficiency. My econometric analyses find that an increase in aggregate demand leads to substantially higher productivity in the state owned enterprises, allowing a substantial part of the redundant labor force to be efficiently employed. I argue for active aggregate demand policy rather than layoff of workers as the primary {{solution to the problem of}} <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment.</b> ...|$|E

The term “informal sector ” does not only imply the processes addressed to manufacturing, but services as well. Informal sector retailing act, which will be mentioned as “peddling ” is regarded as an innovative service handled with small capital or none. Thus, the sector operates both in production and distribution of goods which will be mentioned as “catchpenny articles ” sold on street peddles. The study introduces peddling as the retail service offered by informal sector and aims to investigate the qualities peculiar to peddling act. The wide range {{of goods and services}} peculiar to informal sector are identified to be low-cost, labor intensive, unregulated, competitive and unrecorded. Falling outside the reach of government regulations, peddling appears as an immediate service offered by informal sector that responds a need whether identified or unidentified by the user.

During the plan periods (1963 - 67, 1968 - 72), the annual average real rate {{of growth in the}} GNP has been 6. 4 %. The decade of 1951 - 1962 had experienced a real average annual rate of 4 %. The annual rate of inflation during the 1950 's approached 10 %, whilst between 1961 and 1970 it has been 4. 4 %, a figure comparable to the average for all the O. E. C. D. countries. The long -term target of self-sustained economic growth, i. e., dependent of foreign loans, was a prominent aim of the plans. Despite the evident success of economic planning some basic problems have been a constant source of anxiety to the economic authorities throughout the plan periods: the balance of payments situation, rapid growth of population, the high levels of open and <b>disguised</b> <b>unemployment,</b> insuf- ficiency of domestic savings and financial institutions, excessive dependence of agriculture on weather conditions.
