50|$|Perhaps most {{important}} physical aspect of wood grain in woodworking is the grain direction or slope (e.g. against the grain). The two basic categories of grain are straight and cross grain. Straight grain runs {{parallel to the}} longitudinal axis of the piece. Cross grain deviates from the longitudinal axis in two ways, spiral grain or <b>diagonal</b> <b>grain.</b> The amount of deviation is called {{the slope of the}} grain.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to clarify the cutting {{mechanism}} and the real effect the inclination angle (i(k)) in the oblique cutting of wood. This paper presents the effect of i(k) on the occurrence of splits along the grain below the cutting plane related to surface quality and the degree of chip deformation in a 90 °- 0 °cutting situation. The cutting tests were made with the same with the same method and on the same materials as reported in the previous paper 1). Chip deformation and surface quality were observed and estimated in the oblique cutting of wood against the <b>diagonal</b> <b>grain</b> and with the interlocked grain, and characteristics and sharpness of various planes used in this study are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{hand plane}} {{is one of}} the basic tools used by junior high school {{students}} for woodworking. The invention of the Japanese hand plane with a cap iron was the most important advance in the history of woodwoking tools in the last one haundred years. It has seemingly a very simple mechanism, but it demands a lot of skill to adjust the each part of the plane. Therefore, it {{is one of the}} difficult tools for a general amateur, a junior high school student, a junior high school teacher, and an unskilled woodworker. In this study, in order to make clear the effect of the inclination angle of the knife on the sharpness of the plane, and in order to find the optimum condition for planing, the planing tests with various Japanese hand planes were performed. Chip deformation and surface quality were observed and estimated in planing of wood against the <b>diagonal</b> <b>grain</b> and with the interlocked grain, and characteristics and sharpness of various planes used in this study are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Model bicrystals made by {{adhering}} {{pieces of}} near-single-crystal styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) cylindrical block copolymer (BCP), {{produced by a}} roll-casting process; yield various types of pure tilt grain boundaries. The study of the deformation of the bicrystals, each containing one grain boundary, enables {{a deeper understanding of}} the influences grain boundaries and the incompatibilities between them have on mechanical behavior. Mechanical properties and deformation of near-single-crystal systems provide a reference base for the expected bicrystal behavior. We consider various aspects of incompatibility that can arise from joining two highly anisotropic grains together (i. e. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, deformation mode(s)). Experimentally, the structure of grain boundaries was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In deformation experiments, optical microscopy was employed to examine the deformation gradient in the specimen and in situ small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to monitor the microdomain structural evolution. Finally, finite element simulations illustrated the state of strains of the bicrystal. The symmetric (45 - 45) bicrystal turns out to be the most complex system, despite of the simplest geometry. (cont.) Due to the opposite orientation of the grains, the deformation of the symmetric bicrystal results in a rigid translation of the grain boundary. A triangular shaped influence region indicates that the influence distance varies along the grain boundary length. A portion of the influence region has limited expansion and is slightly sheared along the grain boundary. Another portion of the influence region experiences high tension. For the asymmetric (90 - 45) bicrystal, the deformation is mostly influenced by the difference in deformation modes: dilation vs. shearing. The distortion due to deformation in the <b>diagonal</b> <b>grain</b> induces rotation and advances the deformation in the perpendicular grain near the grain boundary. For the asymmetric (90 - 0) bicrystal, the most influential factors are the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio. The much softer perpendicular grain assumes most of the deformation by extensive dilation and lateral contraction. Near the grain boundary, the perpendicular grain is constrained by the rigid parallel grain such that its deformation is impeded. The influence region in the perpendicular grain is narrow and invariant along the grain boundary length. by Panitarn Wanakamol. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Agroecology {{emphasizes}} {{the use of}} organic materials in agriculture. The organic acids are important sources of organic materials. In order to study the effect of different levels of humic acid on yield and yield components of corn (Zea mays L.) an experiment was conducted at Research Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during 2009. The experiment was conducted with different levels of humic acid (0, 500, 1500, 2500, 3500 and 4500 g. ha- 1) based on randomized complete block design with three replications. Results showed that different levels of humic acid imposed {{a significant effect on}} the yield parameters such as grain yield, biomass, leaf area index, leaf area duration, height, row number and ear length, but there were no significant effects on harvest index, 1000 -grain weight, ear <b>diagonal,</b> and <b>grain</b> number per row did not have significant effect. According to the results, the highest and lowest grain yield belonged to 3500 g. ha- 1 humic acid and control treatments respectively. The highest biomass production observed to 4500 g. ha- 1 humic acid treatment. While the highest row number and ear length belonged to 3500 gha- 1 humic acid treatments. Generally, it seems that application of humic acid due to having nutritional ingredients and different physiological effects improves corn performance and reduces environmental pollution and it {{could be used as a}} natural material to increase and stabilize field crop production...|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, Vionnet {{had created}} a stir by {{developing}} garments utilizing the bias cut, a technique for cutting cloth <b>diagonal</b> to the <b>grain</b> of the fabric, enabling it to cling to the body while stretching and moving with the wearer. While Vionnet herself did not invent the method of cutting fabric on the bias, {{she was the first}} to utilize bias cuts for the entirety of a garment. Her work contrasted existing garments that utilized bias cutting for trims and embellishments placed on fabric pieces cut along the straight-of-grain. Vionnet's use of the bias cut to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look revolutionized women's clothing and carried her {{to the top of the}} fashion world. Although sometimes credited with its invention, Vionnet claimed to have applied the technique, already used in skirts, trims, and embellishments, to full-body dresses. As an expert couturier, Vionnet knew that textiles cut on the bias could be draped to match the curves of a woman's body and express fluidity of motion. She used the cut to promote the potential for expression and motion, integrating comfort and movement as well as form into her designs.|$|R
6000|$|I reflected, as we {{went into}} the house, where we found Ambient {{unfolding}} the Observer at the breakfast-table, that none of them were probably quite so queer as his sister. Mrs. Ambient did not appear at breakfast, being rather tired with her ministrations, during the night, to Dolcino. Her husband mentioned, however, that she was hoping to go to church. I afterwards learned that she did go, but I may as well announce without delay that he and I did not accompany her. It was while the church-bell was murmuring in the distance that the author of Beltraffio led me forth for the ramble he had spoken of in his note. I will not attempt to say where we went, or to describe what we saw. We kept to the fields and copses and commons, and breathed the same sweet air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep, whose woolliness seemed to me, in those early days of my acquaintance with English objects, but a part of the general texture of the small, dense landscape, which looked as if the harvest were gathered by the shears. Everything was full of expression for Mark Ambient's visitor,--from the big, bandy-legged geese, whose whiteness was a [...] "note," [...] amid all the tones of green, as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool, the foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn, with a grassy approach and a pictorial sign,--from these humble wayside animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a pinnacle peep here and there, and looked, even at a distance, like trees of good company, conscious of an individual profile. I admired the hedgerows, I plucked the faint-hued heather, and I was forever stopping to say how charming I thought the thread-like footpaths across the fields, which wandered, in a <b>diagonal</b> of finer <b>grain,</b> from one smooth stile to another. Mark Ambient was abundantly good-natured, and was as much entertained with my observations as I was with the literary allusions of the landscape. We sat and smoked upon stiles, broaching paradoxes in the decent English air; we took short cuts across a park or two, where the bracken was deep and my companion nodded to the old woman at the gate; we skirted rank covers, which rustled here and there as wo passed, and we stretched ourselves at last on a heathery hillside, where, if the sun was not too hot, neither was the earth too cold, and where the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist. Of course I had already told Ambient what I thought of his new novel, having the previous night read every word of the opening chapters before I went to bed.|$|R
