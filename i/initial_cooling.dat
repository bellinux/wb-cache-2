25|$|The {{initiation}} of a snowball Earth event would involve some <b>initial</b> <b>cooling</b> mechanism, which {{would result in}} an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's albedo, which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.|$|E

We calculate evolution of model clusters {{of the initial}} core radii 160 – 300 kpc until the <b>initial</b> central <b>cooling</b> time, and analyze the resultant clusters using the double β-model as done by observational studies. It is found that the core-size distribution thus obtained shows two peaks ∼ 30 – 100 kpc and ∼ 100 – 300 kpc and marginally can reproduce the observed distribution which exhibits two distinct peaks around ∼ 50 kpc and ∼ 200 kpc. This result may suggest radiative-cooling origin for small cores, while cooling is yet insignificant in the clusters of large cores. It {{should be noted that}} the small core peak is reproduced by clusters that are still keeping quasi-hydrostatic balance before the <b>initial</b> central <b>cooling</b> time has elapsed...|$|R

In these liquefiers the Joule-Thompson (J-T) valve is separately {{situated in the}} liquefier cryostat. Therefore there is a regime of J-T heating during the <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> down of the liquefier, since {{there is a time}} lag in reaching the inversion temperature for the J-T valve. The note describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a RDT with an integral J-T valve. A demountable copper cold seal working at a pressure of 15 bar was successfully tested. The J-T valve seat made of Cu-Cr-Zr alloy provided excellent sealing with the stainless-steel valve tip at liquid-helium temperatures. The testing of this RDT with integral J-T showed substantial reduction in cool down time for the liquefier as well as better control of the dewar pressures. ...|$|R

We impose low-frequency (< 0. 05 Hz) transverse photospheric motions, corresponding to the granulations, with velocity 〈dv⊥ 〉 = 0. 7 km/s. In spite of the attenuation in the chromosphere by the reflection, the sufficient energy of the generated outgoing Alfvén waves transmit into the corona to heat and accelerate of the plasma by nonlinear dissipation. Our result clearly shows that the <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> (10 4 K) and static atmosphere is naturally heated up to 10 6 K and accelerated to ≃ 800 km/s, and explain recent SoHO observations and Interplanetary Scintillation measurements.

2500|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} have also evolved {{as a result}} of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on bulk milk coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the bulk milk tank. Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some <b>initial</b> <b>cooling</b> to bring the milk to between [...] A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol.

The formation of transverse cracks {{and the subsequent}} crack spacing present during cool down to - 250 F (116 K) and thermal cycling between 250 and - 250 F (116 and 394 K) was investigated. The state of stress {{in the vicinity of}} a transverse crack and the influence of transverse cracking on the laminate coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was predicted using a generalized plane strain finite element analysis and a modified shear lag analysis. A majority of the cross-ply laminates experienced transverse cracking during the <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> down to - 250 F whereas the quasi-isotropic laminates remained uncracked. The in situ transverse strength of the 90 degree layers was more than 1. 9 times greater than the transverse strength of the unidirectional 90 degree material for all laminates investigated...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of social economy, the electricity consumption by air conditioning increases unceasingly. Even the electricity peak due to the air conditioning is often {{at the same time}} with the industry trade peak, which worsen creates the peak electric power resources shortage, and the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. The ice-storage air conditioning system, as a powerful technology of balancing electric loads from on-peak hours, has the great significance to the electric network. The dynamic ice cold storage technique is the important research direction of the ice storage air conditioning system, In order to obtain guidelines for engineering applications, experiments were conducted using the dynamic ice cold storage air conditioning system developed by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion,and the paper mainly focused on the following aspects; 1) The influences of different <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> thermal storage rate, different cooling load of end-users, different discharge water flow rate and different ice-melting velocity on the discharging characteristics were analyzed in detail, the results show that the ice-melting velocity {{plays an important role in}} discharging characteristics, and <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> thermal storage rate, discharge water flow rate and cooling load of end-users have little effect on the discharging characteristics. 2) In order to get the optimum pipeline designs in ice storage tank during the ice charging process, several ice-melting experiments were conducted. The results show that there exists an optimum pipeline arrangement in the discharging process considering ice discharging efficiency, and the output water of the ice storage tank has little effect on the velocity of ice-melting. 3) The influence on the discharging efficiency of the velocity field in the ice storage tank produced by the input water and output water was analyzed. Through this experimental study, the crucial discharging parameters of the dynamic ice storage air conditioning system were obtained; at the same time, an optimum pipeline design in the ice storage tank during ice discharging process was also obtained. And the experimental foundation and the design instruction were to be provided for the product development of the dynamic ice storage air conditioning. 随着社会经济水平的不断发展，人们对生活环境和工作环境的要求有了很大提高，空调用量不断增加。并且空调用电高峰往往与工商业用电高峰同步，进一步造成高峰期电力资源短缺，电力峰谷差矛盾的加剧。冰蓄冷空调就是为了实现电网负荷削峰平谷而发展起来的一项实用技术，对电网移峰填谷具有重大意义。 动态冰蓄冷技术是冰蓄冷空调的重要研究方向，为了更好的指导工程应用，本文利用中科院广州能源研究所自主研发的动态冰蓄冷空调系统，主要作了以下几项工作： ⑴ 进行动态冰蓄冷空调系统的融冰实验，分析不同初始蓄冰量、不同末端负荷、不同取冷流量、槽内回水速度等因素对融冰取冷特性的影响。结果表明：初始蓄冰量、末端负荷、取冷流量对融冰取冷特性的影响很小，槽内回水速度对融冰取冷起关键作用。 ⑵ 通过改变取水、回水布管方式，以获得最佳取冷速率（或融冰速度）的取水口和回水口的基本设计原则和依据。结果表明，存在最佳的融冰布管方式，取水口对融冰效率的影响很小。 ⑶ 定性阐明蓄冰槽内因回水和取水引起的速度场或其他参数对融冰速度的影响规律； 通过本课题的实验研究，得到了动态冰蓄冷空调系统融冰取冷特性的关键参数和取回水的基本设计原则，为动态冰蓄冷空调的进一步研发提供了参考依据...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} coincidence between large igneous provinces (LIPs) {{and mass}} extinctions {{has led many}} to pose a causal relationship between the two. However, {{there is still no}} consensus on a mechanistic model that explains how magmatism leads to the turnover of terrestrial and marine plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Here we present a synthesis of ammonite biostratigraphy, isotopic data and high precision U-Pb zircon dates from the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) and Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Pl-To) boundaries demonstrating that these biotic crises are both associated with rapid change from an <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> period to greenhouse conditions. We explain these transitions as a result of changing gas species emitted during the progressive thermal erosion of cratonic lithosphere by plume activity or internal heating of the lithosphere. Our petrological model for LIP magmatism argues that initial gas emission was dominated by sulfur liberated from sulfide-bearing cratonic lithosphere before CO 2 became the dominant gas. This model offers an explanation of why LIPs erupted through oceanic lithosphere are not associated with climatic and biotic crises comparable to LIPs emitted through cratonic lithosphere...|$|R

We impose transverse photospheric motions corresponding to the granulations with velocity = 0. 7 km/s and period between 20 seconds and 30 minutes, which generate outgoing Alfven waves. We self-consistently treat these waves and the plasma heating.

We perform hydrodynamical simulations of isolated cluster (total mass 1014 h- 1 M⊙), which is initially evolved to form a dense cool core, having central T ≤ 106 K. A BH resides at the cluster centre, and ejects energy. The feedback-driven fast wind undergoes shock with the slower moving gas, which causes the imparted kinetic energy to be thermalized. Bipolar bubble-like outflows form propagating radially outward to a distance of a few 100 kpc. The radial profiles of median gas properties are influenced by BH feedback in the inner regions (r < 20 - 50 kpc). BH kinetic feedback, with a large value of the feedback efficiency, depletes the inner cool gas and reduces the hot gas content, such that the <b>initial</b> <b>cool</b> core of the cluster is heated up within a time 1. 9 Gyr, whereby the core median temperature rises to above 107 K, and the central entropy flattens.
