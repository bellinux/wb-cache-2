40|$|The {{technique}} of joining {{two or more}} different panels is called as Tailor Welded Blank (TWB). The panels could vary in thicknesses, grades or coating and joined by the mean of welding. This technique is widely being used by automotive manufacturer in the world because of the abundant benefits. But, Malaysian automotive manufacturers are still lack of this advancement. Hence, this project endeavors to build a platform for the industries by pioneering researches in this area. So, {{the purpose of the}} project is to find the best joining materials to be integrated into TWB by comparing each specimen and then proposed the potential TWBs to be used as automotive panel specially aimed for <b>door</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> for the hinge section. Base metals of 0. 7 mm thick from SPCC and SPCEN grades and 1. 2 mm thick from SPHC, SAPH 370 and SGACC grades are chosen to be the joining materials and laser welding is chosen to be the method for joining. Each specimen will be tensile tested in order to find the properties that influence the weldability, formability and drawability of the TWBS. Then the data obtained will be analyze by distinguishing them into several sets of parameter to determine the significant factor and thus, decided the best material combination as the potential Tailor Welded Blanks...|$|E
40|$|A novel necking {{prediction}} model {{was developed and}} verified that could be utilised in finite element (FE) simulations for optimisation of high temperature forming processes parameters, such that a successful component could be formed. The temperature-dependent time-based model combines viscoplastic equations, the Hosford yield criterion and the Marciniak and Kuczynski formulation, {{and is able to}} capture the effects of varying temperature, strain rate and strain path on the formability of a material. The results of high temperature uniaxial tension tests and isothermal formability tests on the aluminium alloy AA 6082 were used for calibration, although the developed model could be similarly calibrated for alternative aluminium alloys. The capability of the model, which could also be run independently, was demonstrated by applying it in a simulation of the solution Heat treatment, Forming and in-die Quenching (HFQ) process for a complex-shaped stiffener component in the commercial FE software PAM-STAMP. The component depth at which severe necking would occur was successfully predicted, and was in agreement with the results of the experimental HFQ trials. The model was subsequently used for the blank shape optimisation of a <b>door</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> component; the final optimised blank shape was formed experimentally, with the resulting component being free of any cracks and incidences of necking. By decoupling the necking {{prediction model}} from the process simulations, significant savings in computational time could be made by selecting only the critical regions in the component where the model would be run. Additionally, the computation could be spread across multiple work stations simultaneously to improve the efficiency of the calculations. The adopted simulation methodology could be expanded further by having multiple independent models that cover other aspects of a forming process such as friction and microstructural evolution.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Cars have {{various types}} of doors. The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split lower opening of front door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of window regulator engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityCurrent welding {{technologies}} for production of aluminum tailor-welded blanks (TWBs) are utilized in low-volume and niche applications, and {{have yet to}} be scaled for the high-volume vehicle market. This study targeted further weight reduction, part reduction, and cost savings by enabling tailor-welded blank technology for aluminum alloys at high-volumes. While friction stir welding (FSW) has traditionally been applied at linear velocities less than one meter per minute, high volume production applications demand the process be extended to higher velocities more amenable to cost sensitive production environments. Unfortunately, weld parameters and performance developed and characterized at low to moderate welding velocities do not directly translate to high speed linear friction stir welding. Therefore, in order to facilitate production of high volume aluminum FSW components, parameters were developed with a minimum welding velocity of three meters per minute. With an emphasis on weld quality, welded blanks were evaluated for post-weld formability using a combination of numerical and experimental methods. Evaluation across scales was ultimately validated by stamping full-size production <b>door</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> made from dissimilar thickness aluminum tailor-welded blanks, which provided validation of the numerical and experimental analysis of laboratory scale tests.

The process factors {{influencing}} the forming quality of car <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> such as stamping direction, binder surface, draw-bead, addendum surface and technical cut are determined {{based on experience}} knowledge. Aiming at local fracture problem of test pieces, some key parameters are determined based on experience knowledge, and the strain in thinning area of sheet metal forming is analyzed by numerical simulation.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} to apprehend which door vibrations contribute to the visible motion occuring during closure,where they emanate from and how they may be abolished. The human ability to distinguish mechanical vibrations is not well-known and should be experimentally investigated. On account on its inertia, the eye perception weakens over frequency and, in particular, no dynamic motion can be discerned over 50 Hz. This determines the upper frequency limit of visibility and rejects the currently assumed value 10 Hz higher. Below 50 Hz, mechanical vibrations may be visible {{as long as their}} amplitude is larger than an experimentally-defined threshold. The frequency domain of interests is deep. During the closure process, the main excitation arises from the water strips that brake the door and transmit energy into <b>inner</b> <b>panels.</b> The resulting vibrations travel towards outer panels because of the strong coupling between the both. Provided that the door natural properties that are likely to be excited from the closure process do not appear below 50 Hz, no external vibrations will be distinguished. <b>Inner</b> <b>panels</b> act as transfer systems between excitation and outer panels, thus their construction must be specifically emphasised. As a rule the current structures are not stiff enough,in particular <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> that {{turn out to be a}} source of weakness. Practical ways to improve the construction are discussed and must be further investigated, for instance using FEM calculations, of which consistence is assessed in this work...|$|R
