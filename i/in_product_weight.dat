30|$|In a {{study of}} food {{self-sufficiency}} and the green revolution in India, De Janvry and Sadoulet (1991) utilized the IDR (weight basis), instead of the traditional SSR. The authors found that self-sufficiency levels for wheat, rice and coarse grains increased following the green revolution in India but without improving the nutrition requirement of its population. Kendall and Petracco (2009) defined the weighted food IDR (WIDR) as the ratio of imports to consumption <b>in</b> <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> for various countries in the Caribbean Basin. They found food import dependency for countries in that region (1990 to 2000) could be divided into three categories: low (WIDR< 30 %); medium (30 %<WIDR< 50 %); and high (WIDR> 50 %).|$|E

After evacuation and flushing with N 2 (three times) and ethylene (twice), the reaction vessel was charged with a quantity of cyclohexane and magnetically stirred under ambient ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was established, a quantity of MAO/alkylaluminum activator, PNP ligand and CrCl 3 (THF) 3 were injected into the reactor. Typically 30  min later, the mixture was rapidly cooled to 0  °C and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of EtOH/HCl (10  wt%). The catalytic activity was calculated from the increase <b>in</b> <b>product</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a work station {{generally}} prescribes a global movement pattern of the operator, but also leaving some degrees of freedom regarding movement strategy. For a specific order picking work station, we studied the movement strategies, the underlying factors {{and its impact on}} performance. Eight subjects performed a task comprising, the picking and placing of an object and pressing a button in eight conditions varying <b>in</b> <b>product</b> <b>weight,</b> movement direction (left vs. right), and placing distance. Movements were analyzed and cycle times were obtained from video-recordings. We observed various types of strategy regarding hand use and global placing mode (reaching vs. placing). The different strategies did not show clear relationships with performance (in contrast to the various work place factors). Ergonomically spoken, the fact that the workstation allows movement variation without loss of performance, is favorable. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Here, we used {{mortar and}} pestle to grind the product. As {{mentioned}} earlier, we conducted each experiment for 30  min and ground the sample after that. Grinding helps in scrubbing off the outer nonporous layer of MgCO 3. And we performed grinding until we noticed no change <b>in</b> <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> after subsequent experiments. In general, after 3 – 4 cycles, we observed {{no change in the}} weight of product. It is certain that such intermittent grinding step is limited to the laboratory and cannot be seen as an industrial operation. Therefore, it is recommended to have an aggregative fluidization regime for a fluidized bed reactor while scaling up MgO–CO 2 reaction. Also, increasing the amount of water vapor cannot lead to the complete carbonate conversion of MgO. Thus, in addition to the amount of steam, surface properties of MgO (such as surface area, particle size, porosity) are also very crucial parameters for the carbonation process.|$|E
30|$|The {{apparent}} consumption or total {{supply of food}} availability in Hawai‘i is defined as local food production plus food imports (continental United States and foreign countries) less food exports (continental United States and foreign countries). Likewise, per capita food supply {{is assumed to be}} identical to per capita food consumption in the local market. All metrics and statistics in this paper refer to food available for human consumption <b>in</b> <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> (kilograms). While there are alternate unit measures, such as the dollar value, calorie value, and nutritional value, we nevertheless invoked Occam’s razor by utilizing the weight measure to keep the overall analysis as simple as possible, without distorting reality or sacrificing accuracy. The measure of food self-sufficiency in dollar value could contribute to unintended results that are counterintuitive to the overall concept itself. Beyond this, one pound of prime beef steak is clearly worth more in dollar value, calorie value, and nutritional value than one pound of rice. Higher-quality products also cost more in monetary value for the same weight measure. For example, a pound of beef steak with a USDA Prime label will cost more than a pound of beef steak labeled USDA Choice or USDA Select. And finally, most waterborne shipping data are published in weight measures, making weight the obvious choice in the data collating process.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop equations to predict retail product and fat trim (weights and percentages) for Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle. Live ultrasound measurements of the longissimus muscle area, backfat thickness at the 12 th rib and rump fat depth and shrunk body weight were obtained from 218 Nellore steers to predict weights and percentages of carcass retail product, pistola retail product and fat trimmings. After slaughter, carcasses were deboned and weighed and percentages of retail cuts were obtained directly. Measurements taken directly in the carcasses explained 97 % and 36 % of variation <b>in</b> carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and percentage, and 94 % and 36 % of variation in pistola retail weight and percentage, respectively. Live measurements explained 93 % of carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and 39 % of carcass retail product percentage. Lower accuracies were observed for pistola retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> (R 2 = 0. 87) and percentage (R 2 = 0. 33). Accuracies for fat trimmings weight and percentage were 79 % and 55 %, respectively. Ultrasound rump fat thickness showed greater correlations with retail product and fat trimmings (weights and percentages) when compared with ultrasound backfat thickness. The weight and percentage of retail products and of trimmable fat can be estimated in Nellore steers from live animal measurements, with similar accuracy to equations developed based on carcass measurements obtained at slaughter. 201...|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} at {{the beginning}} of this section, <b>in</b> final <b>products,</b> the <b>weight</b> percent of the viscous sludge, water, and emulsifier changed by adding solvent. Therefore, the formulation of the continuous phase changed and the viscosity of the continuous and dispersed phases shifted. According to our results and observations, it seems that the presence of non-polar solvents can help to increase the penetration of surfactant molecules into the aqueous and oil phases; therefore, the fluidity of sludge increased. These solvents are more compatible with alkane and paraffin components, which exist in paraffin-based sludge. In this way, the best results were obtained by mixed xylene, toluene and solvent AW- 402. However, due to complexity of intermolecular forces, interfacial tension, etc., it is too difficult to describe the relationship between viscosity and these variations.|$|R

The following materials were examined: high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The results of the functional properties tests, such as compressive strength, softening behavior, bulk density and water absorption are presented in the article. The microstructure of the products was analyzed using SEM and XRD methods. Obtained {{results show that the}} properties of modified product largely depend on the type, form and amount of used polymer.

40|$|Higher order {{scrambled}} digital nets are randomized quasi-Monte Carlo rules {{which have}} recently been introduced in [J. Dick, Ann. Statist., 39 (2011), 1372 [...] 1398] and shown to achieve the optimal rate of convergence of the {{root mean square error}} for numerical integration of smooth functions defined on the s-dimensional unit cube. The key ingredient there is a digit interlacing function applied to the components of a randomly scrambled digital net whose number of components is ds, where the integer d is the so-called interlacing factor. In this paper, we replace the randomly scrambled digital nets by randomly scrambled polynomial lattice point sets, which allows us to obtain a better dependence on the dimension while still achieving the optimal rate of convergence. Our results apply to Owen's full scrambling scheme as well as the simplifications studied by Hickernell, Matoušek and Owen. We consider weighted function spaces with general weights, whose elements have square integrable partial mixed derivatives of order up to α> 1, and derive an upper bound on the variance of the estimator for higher order scrambled polynomial lattice rules. Employing our obtained bound as a quality criterion, we prove that the component-by-component construction can be used to obtain explicit constructions of good polynomial lattice point sets. By first constructing classical polynomial lattice point sets in base b and dimension ds, to which we then apply the interlacing scheme of order d, we obtain a construction cost of the algorithm of order O(dsmb^m) operations using O(b^m) memory <b>in</b> case of <b>product</b> <b>weights,</b> where b^m is the number of points in the polynomial lattice point set...|$|R
40|$|High-dimensional {{integrals}} {{arise in}} a variety of areas, including quantum physics, the physics and chemistry of molecules, statistical mechanics and more recently, in financial applications. In order to approximate multidimensional integrals, one may use Monte Carlo methods in which the quadrature points are generated randomly or quasi-Monte Carlo methods, in which points are generated deterministically. One particular class of quasi-Monte Carlo methods for multivariate integration is represented by lattice rules. Lattice rules constructed throughout this thesis allow good approximations to integrals of functions belonging to certain weighted function spaces. These function spaces were proposed as an explanation as to why integrals in many variables appear to be successfully approximated although the standard theory indicates that the number of quadrature points required for reasonable accuracy would be astronomical because of the large number of variables. The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to theoretical results regarding the construction of lattice rules for multiple integration. We consider both lattice rules for integrals over the unit cube and lattice rules suitable for integrals over Euclidean space. The research reported throughout the thesis is devoted to finding the generating vector required to produce lattice rules that have what is termed a low weighted discrepancy. In simple terms, the discrepancy {{is a measure of the}} uniformity of the distribution of the quadrature points or in other settings, a worst-case error. One of the assumptions used in these weighted function spaces is that variables are arranged in the decreasing order of their importance and the assignment of weights in this situation results <b>in</b> so-called <b>product</b> <b>weights.</b> <b>In</b> other applications it is rather the importance of group of variables that matters. This situation is modelled by using function spaces in which the weights are general. In the weighted settings mentioned above, the quality of the lattice rules is assessed by the weighted discrepancy mentioned earlier. Under appropriate conditions on the weights, the lattice rules constructed here produce a convergence rate of the error that ranges from O(n− 1 / 2) to the (believed) optimal O(n− 1 +δ) for any δ gt 0, with the involved constant independent of the dimension...|$|R

Even though mean slaughter weight was 126. 6 lb heavier for Simmental, Gelbvieh and Charolais breeds, they did not differ from Limousins <b>in</b> retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> because of their lower dressing percentages, higher fat trim percentages, and higher bone percentages. The effects of dietaryenergy density were important for most traits, and little interaction occurred between breed group and dietary energy density. The MARC-III composite had lighter final and carcass weights, a lower percentage of retail product, a higher percentage of fat trim, and a higher percentage of ribeye fat than the MARC-I composite, with the MARC-II composite being generally intermediate.
