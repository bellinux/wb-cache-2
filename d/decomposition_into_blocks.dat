40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} and {{proposing a}} new learning method by formalising a representation paradigm for the domain's and learner's knowledge. Indeed, we mean to set forward a representation method of the treated mathematical (and, more generally, formalisable) domain in which additional points are stressed besides the traditional hierarchical, deductive representations. First of all, inductive aspects, considering {{the problem of}} finding out which parts of a structure, an example or a problem fit a general framework, therefore going from the particular to the general. This allows, in particular, to thoroughly analyse and overcome misconceptions (often actually built up by direct or socially mediated experience). As a further point we mean {{to carry out a}} decomposition into building blocks (of definitions, proofs, exercises etc.) with a point character as close to human experience as possible (e. g., in the sense suggested by modern mereotopology as theory of parts and wholes). Moreover, study of interdisciplinary and infra-disciplinary aspects (links, dependencies, motivations, history etc.) will also be taken into account. Partly as a consequence of this <b>decomposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>blocks,</b> the treated domain is endowed with a richer structure than ordinary textbooks. Moreover, using the graph paradigm, different arcs of several colours (corresponding to different types of links) may link the same couple of nodes. Another aspect is related to taking into account possible relationships among triples, quadruples etc. of notions and concepts; in fact, some kind of n-ary relationship appears necessary. This will in fact be modelled through the use of supplementary nodes. Our approach will moreover also contribute: 1. to increase the capability and the intelligence of trainin [...] ...|$|E

Boundary CFTs allow two different decompositions of two-point functions into conformal blocks: boundary channel and ambient channel. Building on earlier work, we derive a holographic dual of the boundary channel decomposition in terms of bulk-to-bulk propagators on lower dimensional AdS slices. In {{the situation in which}} we can treat the boundary or defect as a perturbation around pure AdS spacetime, we obtain the leading corrections to the two-point function both in boundary and ambient channel in terms of geodesic Witten diagrams which exactly reproduce the <b>decomposition</b> <b>into</b> corresponding conformal <b>blocks</b> on the field theory side.

40|$|A {{coherent}} state path integral of anti-commuting fields {{is considered}} for a two-band, semiconductor-related solid which is driven by a ultrashort, classical laser field. We describe the generation of exciton quasi-particles from the driving laser field as anomalous pairings of the fundamental, fermionic fields. This gives rise to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations from the quartic, fermionic interaction to various Gaussian terms of self-energy matrices. We accomplish path integrals of even-valued self-energy matrices with Euclidean integration measure where three cases of increasing complexity are classified (scalar self-energy variable, density-related self-energy matrix and also a self-energy including anomalous-doubled terms). According to the driving, anomalous-doubled Hamiltonian part, we also specify {{the case of a}} SSB with 'hinge' fields which factorizes the total self-energy matrix by a coset <b>decomposition</b> <b>into</b> density-related, <b>block</b> diagonal self-energy matrices of a background functional and into coset matrices with off-diagonal block generators for the anomalous pairings of fermions. In particular we investigate the transformation from the coset fields of a curved coset space, as the independent field degrees of freedom, to locally 'flat' fields with Euclidean integration measure. This allows to reduce the final path integral to solely 'Nambu'-doubled fields after a saddle point approximaton for the density-related self-energy matrices and also allows to derive classical field equations for exciton quasi-particles from various kinds of gradient expansions of the determinant...|$|R

It is the first member LM(1, 2) {{of the family of}} logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p'). The associated logarithmic conformal field theory admits an infinite family of Kac representations labelled by the Kac labels r,s= 1, 2, [...] In this paper, we explicitly construct the conjugate boundary conditions on the strip. The boundary operators are labelled by the Kac fusion labels (r,s) =(r, 1) x (1,s) and involve a boundary field xi. Tuning the field xi appropriately, we solve exactly for the transfer matrix eigenvalues on arbitrary finite-width strips and obtain the conformal spectra using the Euler-Maclaurin formula. The key to the solution is an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting double-row transfer matrices. The transfer matrix eigenvalues are classified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex spectral-parameter plane. This yields selection rules for the physically relevant solutions to the inversion identity which {{takes the form of a}} <b>decomposition</b> <b>into</b> irreducible <b>blocks</b> corresponding combinatorially to finitized characters given by generalized q-Catalan polynomials.

40|$|We {{propose a}} digital-analog quantum {{simulation}} of generalized Dicke models with superconducting circuits, including Fermi- Bose condensates, biased and pulsed Dicke models, for all regimes of light-matter coupling. We encode these classes {{of problems in}} a set of superconducting qubits coupled with a bosonic mode implemented by a transmission line resonator. Via digital-analog techniques, an efficient quantum simulation can be performed in state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms, by suitable <b>decomposition</b> <b>into</b> analog qubit-bosonic <b>blocks</b> and collective single-qubit pulses through digital steps. Moreover, just a single global analog block would be needed during the whole protocol in most of the cases, superimposed with fast periodic pulses to rotate and detune the qubits. Therefore, a large number of digital steps may be attained with this approach, providing a reduced digital error. Additionally, the number of gates per digital step does not grow with the number of qubits, rendering the simulation efficient. This strategy paves the way for the scalable digital-analog quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving bosonic modes and spin degrees of freedom with superconducting circuits.
