[...] "I felt like I drop-kicked them in the face," [...] she said of informing {{the other members of}} Against Me! [...] "We had the most awkward hug ever, and then they left. And the second <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> door, I was like, 'What the fuck did I just do? Gender dysphoria is the theme of the band's sixth studio album, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, a concept album about a transgender prostitute. Grace later renounced {{the fact that it was}} a concept album and claimed it as [...] "Autobiographical". They began recording in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, working without Butch Vig, who produced New Wave and White Crosses. Instead, Grace was acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. Weinberg departed the group that December. Drummer Atom Willard filled in with the band for their 2013 Australian tour dates, and was confirmed as the band's new drummer on July 31, 2013. In March 2013, the band canceled their US tour with Bad Religion. In May 2013, bassist Andrew Seward also announced his departure from the band. Grace has expressed that she felt the band might not continue under the name Against Me!, but will, however, because she believes the new record has a message she wants to spread. On June 24, 2013, Grace announced that recording for Transgender Dysphoria Blues was finished. Grace went on a solo tour in August in a handful of east coast US cities in support of the record.|$|E
