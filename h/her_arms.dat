In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> {{from that point on}} are duplicated in the arms of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.|$|E

5|$|Mary did {{not enjoy}} her {{retirement}} for long; Eleanor died in <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future.

60|$|There was a hurry in the room, for an instant--longer, perhaps; but {{it seemed}} no more--then all was still again; and Florence, with her face quite colourless, but smiling, held his head upon <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>arm</b> trembled very much.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt his}} hand {{slipping}} under <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> his fingers pressing gently but firmly into her flesh, {{and the experience}} of being impelled by a power stronger than herself, a masculine power, was delicious. <b>Her</b> <b>arm</b> seemed to burn where he touched her.|$|R

60|$|Allie {{could not}} see very well through the heavy veil and she {{stumbled}} over the rude threshold. Durade took hold of <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and presently led her out into the light. The air was hot, windy, dusty. The street was full of hurrying and lounging men. Allie heard different snatches of speech as she and Durade went on. Some stared and leered at her, at which times Durade's hold tightened on <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and his step quickened. She was certain no one looked at Durade. Some man jostled her, another pinched <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>Her</b> ears tingled with unfamiliar coarse speech.|$|R
6000|$|And {{as she sat}} on her {{bed that}} night, musing and half-undressed, she began to run one hand down <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and scrutinize the soft flow of muscle under her skin. She thought of the marvellous beauty of skin, and all the delightfulness of living texture. Oh the back of <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> she found the faintest down of hair in the world. [...] "Etherialized monkey," [...] she said. She held out <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> {{straight}} before <b>her,</b> and turned her hand this way and that.|$|R
5|$|By {{the third}} chorus, the {{interior}} expands and more kachinas are summoned; this sequence also has flowing cherry blossom leaves. The bridge re-plays {{sections of the}} animated lady but with Utada singing the song, both overlapping each other. From there, {{the interior of the}} cathedral starts to disappear and move but then focuses on a herd of houses running through a vast corn field. The video ends with Utada stretching <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> against the sunlight, as the camera zooms away from her via bird's eye view, all shot by a toy airplane which was controlled by the director of the video.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white baby in <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{started a}} little; she turned away. But she felt weak {{and in a}} moment had to lay <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> upon the mantel-shelf for support. She stood a minute so, and then upon <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> she dropped <b>her</b> dizzy head, with closed eyes and pale lips.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> in his, {{and walked}} {{with her to}} the door. There, her {{variable}} humour suddenly changed. She rallied on the instant.
