500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> work with the Weeping Angels.

Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is a moment in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E

New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly.
