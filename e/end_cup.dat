In an amazing season when the Eagles fought off a merger ultimatum from the SACA, the Eagles became the first ever club to record a clean sweep of the 2-day, one-day and T20 competition titles. The Eagles have now won 5 West <b>End</b> <b>Cup</b> (One Day) Premierships (1971/72, 1972/73, 1993/94 and 2003/04, 2016/17) and the single T20 Premiership (2016/17).

30|$|<b>End</b> <b>cup</b> {{misplacement}} {{errors are}} common, especially in obese individuals if the piriformis entry site is used, but consequences {{such as those}} described in this manuscript have not been reported previously in the literature. We currently tie the <b>end</b> <b>cup</b> with an absorbable suture prior to its placement, {{so that it is}} easy to recover the device in the event of misplacement without the need for any additional use of fluoroscopy, loss of time and injuries to adjacent structures, which could end up with FNF.|$|E
30|$|Femoral neck {{fracture}} is {{an unusual}} complication of intramedullary fixation of a broken femur. We report on two cases of femoral neck fractures attributed to misplacement of an <b>end</b> <b>cup</b> and subsequent invasive maneuvers {{in an effort to}} remove it. Iatrogenic fractures of the femoral neck during or after intramedullary nailing are reported in the medical literature. Authors associate it with many possible technical mistakes performed during the procedure, yet no complications after missed <b>end</b> <b>cup</b> placement were noted. We suggest that the fractures described below were a consequence of injury to the vascular supply and bone stock of the initially intact femoral neck.|$|E

30|$|We {{assume that}} both of the above-described FNFs were {{iatrogenic}} and related to harmful maneuvers during efforts to remove the misplaced <b>end</b> <b>cup.</b> The damage to circumflex vessels in case 1 and to endosteal blood supply and bone stock itself in case 2 resulted in late FNF. Apart from this suggestion, in case 1 the weakened, ischemic bone failed during physiologic stresses at bed rest after first fixation with ZESPOL, so we also consider {{the possibility of a}} similar cause for FNF.|$|E
