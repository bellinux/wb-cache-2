DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{sealing material}} (5) comprises a water-swellable durable-elastic polymer and/or a water-swellable durable-elastic mineral substance, which are present in a pre-swollen gel state before introducing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> <b>The</b> pre-swelling degree of the polymer and/or mineral substance before introducing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> is 10 : 1 - 14 : 1 related to the non-swollen state. The remaining swelling degree of the polymer and/or mineral substance is 15 : 1 - 30 : 1 related to pre-swollen state. The particles (25 wt. %) of the polymer and/or mineral substance in a dry non-swollen state have a grain size of 50 - 350 mu m. The maximum grain size of the polymer and/or mineral substance in the dry non-swollen state is less than 500 mu m. The swelling pressure of the polymer and/or mineral substance is 10 - 70 bar during swelling in water in a closed <b>void.</b> <b>The</b> sealing material has a natural polymer and a synthetic polymer. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for sealing voids in building materials and/or building parts. USE - Sealing material useful in a cartridge, for sealing voids in building materials and/or building parts (claimed), and for horizontal and/or vertical sealing of masonry walls. ADVANTAGE - The sealing material economically provides simple, reliable, safe and complete sealing against the outside water in a maintenance-free manner, effectively prevents moisture coming from the outside through cracks, can be economically and efficiently produced with high durability, high degree of flexibility and improved vapor diffusion resistance, and completely suppresses the water transport process through the capillary and/ or pore system of the building materials and/or building parts...|$|R

In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>void,</b> still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense {{as one of the}} reasons for the loss.|$|E

Having woken up and saved Earth, the Doctor enjoys Christmas dinner with Rose before the two once again depart to parts unknown. Over the second series (2006), Rose and the Doctor grow increasingly close to one another. After defeating a werewolf, they are knighted by Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins), who banishes them as threats to the Empire whilst setting up the Torchwood Institute, which aims to track the Doctor and other aliens. Their relationship proves a source of tension once Mickey joins the pair in their travels, at the suggestion of the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). Whilst stranded in a parallel universe, Rose meets a rich, entrepreneur version of her father who never died. Mickey decides to stay behind on this world to battle the Cybermen—emotionless cyborgs which seek to convert humans to their ranks—as he no longer wants to feel like a spare part. Alone with the Doctor again, Rose faces the mythical Beast (Gabriel Woolf), who prophesies that Rose will soon die in battle. This day comes when, in the present day, the Torchwood Institute's director Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) accidentally allows the Cybermen army and Dalek Cult of Skaro into Rose's reality, where they begin a war.

500|$|In the 1969–70 NBA season {{under new}} coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers' season {{began with a}} shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed {{practically}} the whole regular season. As after Baylor's injury years before, West stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>void,</b> leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2points per game, and averaging 4.6rebounds and 7.5assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team vote and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years. The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain. In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102–100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: [...] "The man's crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it's really going in!" [...] West incredibly connected, and this basket was later {{called one of the}} greatest moments ever by the NBA. As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111-108. In Game 4, the guard scored 37points and 18assists, and the Lakers won. However, more frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series; instead of capitalising on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107-100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. After Chamberlain scored 45points and West 31points plus 13assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. However, West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections, and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first fourpoints, and inspired his team {{to one of the most}} famous playoff upsets of all time. With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36points and 19assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett.|$|E
