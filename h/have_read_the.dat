5|$|Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky: A novice actor, he is {{the only}} cast member to <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script and book and {{attended}} the assigned boot camp prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of straight man in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an internal conflict or deep-seated insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.|$|E

25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only {{translated}} into Latin {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century. This means that copies would hardly have been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.|$|E
25|$|Others, though, have {{questioned}} the evidence for precisely how John might {{have been influenced by}} Boscan and Garcilaso. Dámaso Alonso argued that John must <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> newly published 1575 edition of the poets in Ávila, shortly before his imprisonment in Toledo, and that this must have been the key influence which rekindled in John memories of his own reading of Garcilaso as a young student of the Jesuits in Medina del Campo. However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators.|$|E
25|$|Jewish mysticism has {{influenced}} {{the thought of}} some major Jewish theologians in the 20th century, outside of Kabbalistic or Hasidic traditions. The first Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook was a mystical thinker who drew heavily on Kabbalistic notions through his own poetic terminology. His writings are concerned with fusing the false divisions between sacred and secular, rational and mystical, legal and imaginative. Students of Joseph B. Soloveitchik, figurehead of American Modern Orthodox Judaism <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> influence of Kabbalistic symbols in his philosophical works. Neo-Hasidism, rather than Kabbalah, shaped Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue and Abraham Joshua Heschel's Conservative Judaism. Lurianic symbols of Tzimtzum and Shevirah have informed Holocaust theologians.|$|E

500|$|Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, one of few {{mainstream}} {{critics to}} <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> comic-book miniseries, {{said that the}} film compared poorly with the source material. Noting that the hero in the comic goes even further, [...] "breaking the fourth wall and positioning himself so that he's 'prison-raping' and taunting the reader for having liked the series", Lovece found that, [...] "hile Millar may have contempt for his readers—and, by extension, the medium in which he works—at least {{he has his own}} vision, and gets it across with style and wit"; qualities that, in Lovece's opinion, the movie lacked.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) {{wrote of}} this curious natural {{phenomenon}} of fossils as well. [...] He {{was known to}} <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> works of Shen Kuo. Shen's description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, De veteribus et novis metallis. Furthermore, Shen's theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of James Hutton, who published his groundbreaking work in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology). [...] Historian Joseph Needham likened Shen's account {{to that of the}} Scottish scientist Roderick Murchison (1792–1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.|$|E
500|$|Hillary Goldstein of IGN {{praised the}} comic book, {{saying that it}} [...] "is truly {{the cream of the}} crop when it comes to Vertigo books.

Whether you <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>The</b> Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall.

500|$|For To, filming Vengeance {{differed}} from his usual style of filmmaking. [...] While he {{is used to}} improvising his scenes as a director, Vengeance marked the first time that To had to work with a complete shooting script since the producers demanded that the story and dialogue already be written. Hallyday was the only actor to <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, while Anthony Wong had knowledge of the story. To explained that his purpose was to [...] "keep the actors natural and spontaneous. They don't have time to create something. They're given a situation and they act it right away." [...] After filming was complete, the cast and crew celebrated by having a final dinner at a restaurant located near the Milkyway Image studio, hoping to meet again at the forthcoming Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{describes}} the speaker – a woman, as the adjective [...] "" [...] {{in the final}} line is feminine – lying alone at night. [...] Clay suggests that this was intended to allude to, and contrast with, the myth of Selene and her mortal lover Endymion, who were reunited each night. [...] Other authors, such as Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> poem as describing the speaker waiting for a lover. Paula Reiner and David Kovacs note, however, that the poem says nothing explicitly about waiting. [...] Instead, they suggest, the poem might equally well {{be read as a}} generalised complaint of loneliness rather than being specifically concerned with a lover's absence; Odysseus Tsagarakis says that [...] "the feeling of loneliness is most beautifully expressed by Sappho" [...] in this fragment.|$|E

That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|As Cotton's {{theology}} changed, {{he began}} placing {{less emphasis on}} preparation ("works") to obtain God's salvation, and more emphasis on the [...] "transforming character of the moment of religious conversion in which mortal man [...] infused with a divine grace." [...] His theology was molded {{by a number of}} individuals, besides influences such as Perkins and Sibbes; his basic tenets stemmed from reformer John Calvin. [...] At one point he wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> fathers, and the schoolmen and Calvin too, but I find that he that has Calvin has them all." [...] Other inspirations to his theology, as revealed in his writings, include the models of the Apostle Paul and Bishop Cyprian, and reformation leaders Zacharias Ursinus, Theodore Beza, Franciscus Junius, Jerome Zanchius, Peter Martyr, Johannes Piscator, and Martin Bucer. [...] Additional English role models include Paul Baynes, Thomas Cartwright, Laurence Chaderton, Arthur Hildersham, William Ames, William Whitaker, John Jewel, and John Whitgift.|$|E
500|$|Birkett {{arrived in}} court two hours late. In his defence, {{he tried to}} claim that the {{relationships}} between women in The Well of Loneliness were purely platonic in nature. Biron replied, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book." [...] Hall had urged Birkett before the trial not to [...] "sell the inverts in our defence". She took advantage of a lunch recess to tell him that if he continued to maintain her book had no lesbian content she would stand up in court and tell the magistrate the truth before anyone could stop her. Birkett was forced to retract. He argued instead that the book was tasteful and possessed a high degree of literary merit. James Melville, appearing for Leopold Hill, took a similar line: the book was [...] "written in a reverend spirit", not to inspire libidinous thoughts but to examine a social question. The theme itself should not be forbidden, and the book's treatment of its theme was unexceptionable.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noted}} {{homosexual}} undercurrents {{running through the}} film, particularly in Jacqueline's character and her relationship with Frances, a cult member who is an employee at the company she formerly owned. The film was featured in Turner Classic Movies Channel's Screened Out, which celebrated gay and lesbian themes in classic Hollywood cinema. Other film theorists, such as Harry M. Benshoff, author of Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film (1997), <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> film's anchoring of its Palladist characters in Greenwich Village—a neighborhood {{with a history of}} gay and lesbian residents—as another prominent undercurrent. In his assessment of the film, Benshoff notes: [...] "The Seventh Victim invokes the analogy in ways more sympathetic to homosexuality. While it could have easily fallen into the trap of using gay and lesbian signifiers to characterize its villains (i.e. homosexual = Satanist, as did Universal's The Black Cat in 1934), the film is much more complex than that." [...] Additionally, Benshoff notes that, while contemporary reviews did not comment on the film's homosexual undertones, they did note its [...] "baffling" [...] subtleties.|$|E

[...] Wolf Mankowitz proclaimed Dan Dare a [...] "Hero of Our Time", and the Earl of Jellicoe was reported to <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> comic in the library of Westminster Palace.

500|$|The {{bodies of}} the three men were cremated in 1930 without further {{examination}} upon being returned to Sweden. The question of what, exactly, caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars. Several medical practitioners and amateur historians <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> extensive diaries with a detective's eye, looking for clues in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site. They agree on many particulars. For instance, the explorers {{are known to have}} eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals. They suffered often from foot pains and diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet. When they moved on to Kvitøya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside the tent, and even down by the water's edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, died first and was [...] "buried" [...] (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others. However, the interpretation of these observations is contested.|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{first contact}} {{when he moved}} to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born {{barrister}} who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, {{and one of the few}} people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland. Hamilton had been one of Murray's sponsors when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of chambers at No. 1 Old Square. At this time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be called to the Bar was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to <b>have</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward. Thus, most of Murray's practical training came from reading the papers in Hamilton's chambers and listening to Lord Raymond speak in court, along with tutoring by Thomas Denison on how to write special pleadings. Murray also studied various texts, including the French Ordinance de la Marine (a predecessor to the Napoleonic Commercial Code), the works of Bracton and Littleton and [...] "crabbed and uncouth compositions" [...] on municipal law.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{develop a}} more {{efficient}} way of informing potential clinical trial volunteers of exactly what they could expect during (and after) their participation in a clinical trial {{as well as the}} sponsor’s expectations from the volunteer. A multiple choice questionnaire, which was based on the criteria as specified by Guideline 5 of the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH), was administered to 28 Volunteers after only <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> Patient Information Leaflet/Informed Consent Document (PIL/PIL/ICD), to 21 Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a question and answer session, to 17 Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a presentation and 19 Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a presentation and a question and answer session. In total, 85 Volunteers completed the questionnaire. The average calculated percentage* of volunteers who <b>had</b> only <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD was 61 %, 63 % for Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a question and answer session, 73 % for Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a presentation and 68 % for Volunteers who <b>had</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> PIL/ICD and attended a presentation and question and answer session. In total, the average calculated percentage was 66 %. Eighty four percent {{of the total number of}} volunteers answered the question on withdrawal consequence incorrectly, 43 % of Volunteers answered questions on side effects incorrectly and 100 % of the Volunteers answered the question on the duration of storage of samples incorrectly. Despite increasing regulatory and ethical scrutiny, deficiencies still exist in Volunteer comprehension of the research in which they participate, as well as differences in how comprehension is measured and assessed. Results indicated that any successful consent process should, at a minimum, include a visual communication mode. Concepts that are not well understood within the South-African context are withdrawal consequence, methodology such as double-blind or single blind, side effects, duration of archiving, treatment alternatives and the role of the investigator. *calculated % for each volunteer = score out of 25 x 10...|$|R
