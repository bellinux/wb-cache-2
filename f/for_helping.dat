50|$|In {{recordings}} of the 9-1-1 calls, yells <b>for</b> <b>help</b> are audible in the background.

40|$|In primates, {{during times}} of need, calling <b>for</b> <b>help</b> is a {{universal}} experience. Calling <b>for</b> <b>help</b> recruits social support and promotes survival. However, calling <b>for</b> <b>help</b> also can attract predators, and it is adaptive to inhibit calls <b>for</b> <b>help</b> when a potential threat is perceived. Based on this, we hypothesized that individual differences in calling <b>for</b> <b>help</b> would {{be related to the}} activity of brain systems that mediate goal-directed behavior and the detection of threat. By using high-resolution positron emission tomography in rhesus monkeys undergoing social separation, we demonstrate that increased [18 F]-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose uptake in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreased uptake in the amygdala independently predict individual differences in calling <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> When taken together, these two regions account for 76 % of the variance in calling <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> This result suggests that the drive for affiliation and the perception of threat determine the intensity of an individual's behavior during separation. These findings in monkeys are relevant to humans and provide a conceptual neural framework to understand individual differences in how primates behave when in need of social support...|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} {{finding of}} the research is that intervention depends {{on whether or not}} a victim asked <b>for</b> <b>help</b> by specifying a screen name. The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person <b>for</b> <b>help.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper studied whether {{threats to}} {{self-esteem}} and goal orientation affected an individual?s propensity to ask <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Eighty-two undergraduate {{students from the}} University of Waterloo completed a self-esteem and goal orientation questionnaire in addition to completing two tests. One test {{was designed to be}} more self-relevant than the other, making that test more potentially threatening to an individual?s self-esteem. In each test, subjects were given the opportunity to ask <b>for</b> <b>help</b> on each question. The results show that the use of social comparison motivates individuals to engage in self-protection by reducing their willingness to ask <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> In situations where many others had asked <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> help seeking behavior increased. These results extend other research in showing the impact of social comparison on individual behaviour...|$|R
