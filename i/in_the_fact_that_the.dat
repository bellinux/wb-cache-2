5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female is evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just {{one of the three}} is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
25|$|The irony lay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spanish {{backed the}} Cherokee and Muscogee harassing their territories.

Gardoqui's negotiations with Wilkinson, {{initiated by the}} latter, to bring Kentucky (then a territory) into the Spanish orbit also were separate but simultaneous.|$|E

25|$|As {{cultural}} scientist Roland Benedikter poses in {{his book}} on Sustainable Democratization of Iraq and {{in a series of}} essays, one main cause of the ongoing problems of pacification seems to consist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> socio-cultural dimensions of sustainability, including questions of ethnicity, religion and minority issues, have not been included appropriately in the overall democratization strategies so far.|$|E

25|$|No {{small part}} of Furness's {{historical}} significance lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young Louis Sullivan picked this office - then known as Furness & Hewitt - to work in {{for a short period}} after he left Ware's School in Boston. As Sullivan's Autobiography of an Idea testifies, the vitality and originality of Furness meant more to him than what he was taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.|$|E
25|$|In general, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that smaller colonies are less aggressive than larger ones. There are differing observations of the D. arenaria’s personality, one stating that they are quarrelsome and then other arguing that they are not. But this difference may lie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first observation was observing the behavior when approaching a D. arenaria nest, whereas the other was describing behavior of workers away from their nest individually. Smaller colonies’ colony defense behavior is said to be unpredictable and erratic.|$|E

25|$|The print's {{attribution}} is {{a subject}} of some contention. Copies of the print belong to at least 2 public collections: that of the ROM, and that of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. According to its labeling, these institutions disagree on when and by whom it was produced. The problem lies mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> print has no date stamp and is signed Sadamasu ga , a name used by two nineteenth century Osaka print-makers: Sadamasu I and Sadamasu II.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of discovery, the {{archaeologist}} Giuseppe Atzori insistently pointed out to the authorities the failure to fence the site. Actually at the Center for Restoration and Conservation of Li Punti (Sassari) most of the sculptures are without head and the cause lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site was unattended and was plundered for a long time. The looting was focused on the best parts of the sculptures, principally the head with the enigmatic eyes. Only later the area was purchased and excavation campaigns began.|$|E
25|$|Another {{apparent}} contradiction lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{group velocity}} in anomalously dispersive media {{is higher than}} the speed of light. This was investigated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1907, 1914) and Léon Brillouin (1914). They {{came to the conclusion that}} in such cases the signal velocity is not equal to the group velocity, but to the front velocity which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by Günter Nimtz can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.|$|E

25|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is {{a great source of}} confusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire. This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} Doppler {{effect for}} light in {{astronomy}} depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not homogeneous. They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{the church}} was handed down to the Kiev Council in 1768. The Kiev City Duma took control over the church, and later reorganized into the Kiev Council in 1785. In 1815, a strong storm tore off the church's cupolas. After the storm, {{the church was}} in need of a full restoration. In the next year, {{architect}} Andrey Melensky made a plan of the building's façade and sent them for consideration to Saint Petersburg. In 1825–1828, the Saint Andrew's Church was restored, based on Melensky's plans. The red mission tiles was replaced by metal, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cupolas lost some decor and changed their form.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the mental symptoms of subclinical thyroid disease, might be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid. Also, hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to low-grade hyperthyroidism can result in an anxiety disorder before other Graves' disease symptoms emerge. E.g., panic disorder has been reported to precede Graves' hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few {{historical}} details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating may lie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because {{of the use of}} the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between Haggai and Zechariah, slightly before Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445BC.|$|E
25|$|Although Parma {{had taken}} the city, his Protestant opponents took some comfort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city had been {{destroyed}} {{in the process and}} was of no use as a garrison. Yet this was in no way a Pyrrhic victory; Parma had lost fewer than 500 of his own force, and the Protestant rebels had lost a significant geographical and militarily strategic point, and one of their more intrepid young commanders in Cloedt. Parma had nearly unfettered access to the Electorate's northern regions, called the Niederstift, from which he could mount an attack on the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands. Gebhard renounced of the Electorate in 1588. Despite Ernst of Bavaria's unchallenged possession, Parma continued to acquire and fortify towns throughout the region.|$|E
