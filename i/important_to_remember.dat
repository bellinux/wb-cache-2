5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
25|$|Domestic abuse can be {{broadly defined}} as {{any form of}} abusive {{behaviours}} by one or both partners in an intimate relationship, such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that abuse is always intentional, and can not happen by accident.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it helps}} focus managers' {{attention}} on strategic {{issues and the}} management of the implementation of strategy, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy.

25|$|If wound pain is not {{assessed}} {{and documented}} {{it may be}} ignored and/or not addressed properly. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that increased wound pain may be an indicator of wound complications that need treatment, and therefore practitioners must constantly reassess the wound {{as well as the}} associated pain.|$|E
25|$|The ADL {{holds that}} it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the Holocaust, {{in order to prevent}} such an event from reoccurring. Along with {{sponsoring}} events and fighting Holocaust deniers and revisionists, the ADL has been active in urging action to stop modern-day ethnic cleansing and genocide in places such as Bosnia, Darfur, and Sudan.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} {{of two or more}} incomes, allow for households to increase their income substantially without moving higher on the occupational ladder or attaining higher educational degrees. Thus it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the favorable economic position of households in the top two quintiles is in some cases the result of combined income, rather than demand for a single worker.|$|E
50|$|One <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{about an}} income {{statement}} is that it represents {{a period of time}} like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.|$|R

5000|$|It is <b>important</b> not <b>to</b> [...] "enable" [...] {{the child}} with {{selective}} mutism {{by allowing them to}} remain silent in the social settings that they are uncomfortable in. Both parents and teachers need {{to be involved in the}} treatment of selective mutism. The most <b>important</b> factor <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that the child does not have a speech disorder; it is an anxiety disorder.|$|R
25|$|On many lines, the new {{units were}} warmly welcomed. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that while the}} first {{generation}} DMUs had given many years of service, in very many cases, they suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, {{the mere fact that}} the trains were clean and new was enough to make them welcome countrywide.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, {{which means}} they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform will sink {{to the bottom of}} a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when partitioning compounds between solvents and water in a separatory funnel during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|Considering the biomechanical {{force system}} {{generated}} by a cantilever, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that a combination of}} a moment and a force is produced at the unit into which the cantilever is inserted, whereas only a single force is developed with respect to the point of force application of the other end. The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E
50|$|Gallium boreale is edible, with a {{sweet smell}} and taste, and can be eaten as a wild salad green. Varieties such as Galium boreale which do not contain the small hooks on the stem are not as {{palatable}} as the hooked varieties of Galium, like Galium aparine, but are <b>important</b> plants <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> for survival purposes.|$|R
40|$|Pedagogies is {{strictly}} linked with few branches of philosophy, such anthropology end ethics. It’s very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remembering</b> {{the impact of}} philosophical reflections on educational process. Trying to reform educational system, {{we can use the}} tools of realistic, or idealistic systems of philosophy. Each of them will appoint “an educational goal” and the measures to achieve it. In the idealistic point of view, “the goal” means some special model to which we aspire through educational activities. On the other hand, realistic views shows, that the concrete man is the most important. Concrete man can be engaged and remains in the interpersonal relations. The quality educational process depends on a choice the philosophical system, which keeps the theoretical background of reform the educational system. Dorota Łażewsk...|$|R
50|$|Communicate — this is {{probably}} the most <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when playing a 2-3 zone. Players should talk to each other on the court about who's open, who should be where, what to do, and everything else worth knowing. The team must work together, {{and the best way to}} do so is to communicate with each other on the floor.|$|R
25|$|Heat {{generated}} by fission products would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The CANDU designs have several emergency cooling systems, {{as well as}} having limited self-pumping capability through thermal means (the steam generator is well above the reactor). Even {{in the event of}} a catastrophic accident and core meltdown, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the fuel is not critical in light water. This means that cooling the core with water from nearby sources will not add to the reactivity of the fuel mass.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes {{were not}} {{essentially}} physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended {{to follow the}} line of least resistance, twisting and turning to avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a difficult area to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected {{the condition of the}} pathway.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{equation}} of state, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality.

30|$|In general, careful {{modeling}} {{is required}} when using MICE to obtain valid statistical inferences (Marchenko, 2011). Another <b>important</b> point <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> concerns {{the order in}} which the imputation models should be imputed. Imputation using chained equations does not require us to specifically order the variables that must be imputed because the software imputes, by default, the variables from the most observed to the least observed.|$|R

25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that the}} {{builders}} were not {{working on a}} clean site but {{would have had to}} clear back the rubble and surviving parts of the old church as they built the new. Nevertheless, work progressed rapidly. The south porch with most of its sculpture was installed by 1210, and by 1215 the north porch had been completed and the western rose installed. The nave high vaults were erected in the 1220s, the canons moved into their new stalls in 1221 under a temporary roof {{at the level of the}} clerestory, and the transept roses were erected over the subsequent two decades. The high vaults over the choir were not built until the last years of the 1250s, as was rediscovered in the first decade of the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{church was}} {{involved}} in various campaigns of russification, and, as a consequence, it was accused of participating in anti-Jewish pogroms. In the case of anti-semitism and the anti-Jewish pogroms, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church; it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that many Russian Orthodox clerics, including senior hierarchs, openly defended persecuted Jews, at least starting with {{the second half of}} the 19th century. Also, the Church has no official position on Judaism as such. In modern times, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has been accused of antisemitism for his book Two Hundred Years Together, where he alleges Jewish participation in the political repression of the Soviet regime (see also Hebrew and Byzantine relations). Solzhenitsyn's book Two Hundred Years Together is a historical study of the relationship between Russian Orthodox Christians and Jews in Russia from 1772 to modern times.|$|E

25|$|The human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is the most}} common STI in the United States. There are more than 40 different strands of HPV and many do not cause any health problems. In 90% of cases the body’s immune system clears the infection naturally within 2 years. Some cases may not be cleared and can lead to genital warts (bumps around the genitals that can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like cauliflower) or cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers. Symptoms might not show up until advanced stages. It is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers. There are also two vaccines available for women (Cervarix and Gardasil) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-to-genital contact as well as during oral sex. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that the infected partner might not have any symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López who are just riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|E
25|$|Triangles are sturdy; while a {{rectangle}} can collapse into a parallelogram from pressure {{to one of}} its points, triangles have a natural strength which supports structures against lateral pressures. A triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, {{each of the three}} sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense. Some innovative designers have proposed making bricks not out of rectangles, but with triangular shapes which can be combined in three dimensions. It is likely that triangles will be used increasingly in new ways as architecture increases in complexity. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering however, and this is the basis for one of the strongest man made structures, the tetrahedral truss.|$|E
50|$|One <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is {{that the}} monster's {{original}} spot needs to stay covered {{to send it to}} a hole. If Lolo removes a monster that was sent to a hole and its original starting point was uncovered, it would not continue going to the hole, but rather back to its original starting point. Though in some rooms, monsters may need to be sent back to their original starting point in order to solve the room.|$|R

Even if no one ever downloads it to a Nokia, the hair-raising violin of [...] "A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind" [...] makes its point just fine as part of the album. And that's the most <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> about this album: the concept is strong, but the music is stronger." ...|$|R
40|$|Orbital {{fractures}} {{account for}} {{a significant portion of}} traumatic facial injuries. Although plastic surgery literature is helpful, additional pearls and insights are provided in this article from the experience of an oculoplastic surgeon. The fundamentals remain the same, but the perceptions differ and provide a healthy perspective on a long-standing issue. The most <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> is that the optimal management plan is often variable, and the proper choice regarding which plan to choose rests upon the clinical scenario and the surgeon having an honest perception of his or her level of expertise and comfort level...|$|R
