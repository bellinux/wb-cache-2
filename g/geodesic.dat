40|$|We {{compute the}} {{principal}} Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov-Sinai(KS) entropy for Kerr-Newman black hole space-times and investigate {{the stability and}} instability of the equatorial circular <b>geodesics</b> via these exponents. We also show that the principal Lyapunov exponent and KS entropy can be {{expressed in terms of}} the radial equation of ISCO(innermost stable circular orbit) for timelike circular <b>geodesics.</b> The other aspect we have studied that among the all possible circular <b>geodesics,</b> which encircle the central black-hole, the timelike circular <b>geodesics</b> has the longest orbital period i. e. T_{timelike} > T_{photon}, than the null circular <b>geodesics</b> (photon sphere) as measured by asymptotic observers. Thus, the timelike circular <b>geodesics</b> provide the slowest way to circle the Kerr-Newman black-hole. In fact, any stable timelike circular <b>geodesics</b> other than the ISCO traverses more slowly than the null circular <b>geodesics.</b> Comment: 22 pages, text overlaps with arXiv: 1205. 565...|$|R

5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and <b>geodesic</b> readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 <b>geodesic</b> stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E
5|$|On a Riemannian manifold, any smooth simple {{closed curve}} will remain smooth and {{simple as it}} evolves, {{just as in the}} Euclidean case. It will either {{collapse}} to a point in a finite amount of time, or remain smooth and simple forever. In the latter case, the curve necessarily converges to a closed <b>geodesic</b> of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a <b>geodesic</b> from general relativity itself.|$|E
40|$|We {{define a}} class a metric spaces we call Brownian surfaces, arising as the scaling limits of random maps on general {{orientable}} surfaces with a boundary and we study the <b>geodesics</b> from a uniformly chosen random point. These metric spaces generalize the well-known Brownian map and our results generalize the properties shown by Le Gall on <b>geodesics</b> {{in the latter}} space. We use a different approach based on two ingredients: we first study typical <b>geodesics</b> and then all <b>geodesics</b> by an "entrapment" strategy. In particular, we give geometrical characterizations of some subsets of interest, in terms of <b>geodesics,</b> boundary points and concatenations of <b>geodesics</b> that are not homotopic to 0...|$|R
40|$|We {{continue}} {{the study of}} infinite <b>geodesics</b> in planar first-passage percolation, pioneered by Newman in the mid 1990 s. Building on more recent work of Hoffman, and Damron and Hanson, we develop an ergodic theory for infinite <b>geodesics</b> via the study of what we shall call `random coalescing geodesics'. Random coalescing <b>geodesics</b> {{have a range of}} nice asymptotic properties, such as asymptotic directions and linear Busemann functions. We show that random coalescing <b>geodesics</b> are (in some sense) dense in the space of <b>geodesics.</b> This allows us to extrapolate properties from random coalescing <b>geodesics</b> to obtain statements on all infinite <b>geodesics.</b> As an application of this theory we solve the `midpoint problem' of Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm and address a question of Furstenberg on the existence of bigeodesics.

5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its <b>geodesic</b> path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a <b>geodesic,</b> which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E

5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold.

The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E

In 1972, Dainin Katagiri was invited from California to Minneapolis—by one account, a place he thought nobody else would want to go—where he founded a lineage which today includes three Sōtō Zen centers among the city's nearly 20 Buddhist and meditation centers.
