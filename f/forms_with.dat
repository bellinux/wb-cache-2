5|$|As {{with other}} <b>forms</b> <b>with</b> {{a long history}} in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including <b>forms</b> <b>with</b> a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger <b>forms</b> <b>with</b> Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included <b>forms</b> <b>with</b> the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E

5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of <b>forms</b> <b>with</b> ctenidial gills.

5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several <b>forms,</b> <b>with</b> new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E

40|$|When {{expanded}} through passage, chondrocytes {{lose their}} ability to produce high-quality cartilaginous matrix. This study attempts to improve the properties of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> expanded chondrocytes through alterations in the expansion protocol and the ratio of primary to expanded chondrocytes used to form carti-lage constructs. A chondrogenically tuned expansion protocol provided similar monolayer growth rates as those obtained using serum-containing medium and enhanced cartilaginous properties of resultant constructs. Various ratios of primary to chondrogenically expanded chondrocytes were then self-assembled to form neo-cartilage. Biochemical analysis showed that constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only expanded cells had twice the GAG per wet weight and collagen II/collagen I ratio compared to constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> primary chondrocytes. Biomechanically, compressive properties of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only passaged cells matched the instan-taneous modulus and exceeded the relaxation modulus of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only primary cells. These counterintuitive results show that, by applying proper expansion and three-dimensional culture techniques, the cartilage-forming potential of adult chondrocytes expanded through passage can be enhanced over that of primary cells...|$|R

40|$|Solder dip {{may be used}} as a {{peripheral}} leaded terminal refinishing process to replace the original pure tin finish with eutectic tin-lead finish to mitigate tin-whisker risk. Tin-silver-copper is an option of lead-free terminal finish. Solder dip is the way to obtain tin-silver-copper finish. However, the reliability of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> these refinished terminals may be affected by the refinishing process. The solder joint reliability of refinished components under temperature cycling conditions need to be determined to study the effects of refinishing on the solder joint reliability. Tin-bismuth terminal finish is another tin-whisker mitigation strategy. The reliability of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> tin-bismuth finished terminals also needs to be determined before the implementation. The microstructure and strength of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> refinished terminals were evaluated by comparing with those of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> original pure tin finished terminals. The reliability of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> original pure tin finished terminals, refinished terminals and original tin-bismuth finished terminals were tested under temperature cycling. Under temperature cycling test, solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder dipped terminals have shorter characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> the original pure tin finished terminals in both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. Solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> eutectic SnPb dipped terminals have equal characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages, but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> the original pure tin finished terminals when reflowed with eutectic SnPb solder. Solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> tin-bismuth finished terminals have shorter characteristic life than original pure tin finished terminals for thin-small-outline-packages for both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. If a 20 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions is acceptable, then the SAC solder dip process can be a potential choice for refinishing purpose. SnPb solder dip process is a good choice of refinish process without causing degradation to characteristic life under temperature cycling conditions. If a 25 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions can be accepted, then SnBi finish can be an alternative finish to tin finish...|$|R
