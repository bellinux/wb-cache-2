40|$|Textiles {{provide an}} ideal {{structure}} for embedding sensors for medical devices. Skin temperature measurement {{is one area}} in which a sensor textile could be particularly beneficial; pathological skin is normally very sensitive, making the comfort of anything placed on that skin paramount. Skin temperature is an important parameter to measure {{for a number of}} medical applications, including for the early detection of diabetic foot ulcer formation. To this end an electronic temperature-sensor yarn was developed by embedding a commercially available thermistor chip into the fibres of a yarn, which can be used to produce a textile or a garment. As part of this process a resin was used to encapsulate the thermistor. This protects the thermistor from mechanical and chemical stresses, and also allows the sensing yarn to be washed. Building off preliminary work, the behaviour and performance of an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>thermistor</b> has been characterised to determine the effect of encapsulation on the step response time and absolute temperature measurements. Over the temperature range of interest only a minimal effect was observed, with step response times varying between 0. 01 – 0. 35 s. A general solution is presented for the heat transfer coefficient compared to size of the micro-pod formed by the encapsulation of the thermistor. Finally, a prototype temperature-sensing sock was produced using a network of sensing yarns as a demonstrator of a system that could warn of impending ulcer formation in diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|Thermistors are {{a useful}} and {{important}} class of electrical ther-mometer, with a transfer function of resistance versus temperature. The resistance-temperature relationship is usually highly non-linear, and much {{effort has been}} given to the invention of linearizing circuitry. In the most commonly used types, the coefficient of resistance change is negative; that is, higher temperatures result in higher conduction (lower resistance). (We will ignore positive temperature coefficient thermistors, which have little metrological signifigance). Quality of performance varies widely, in terms of interchangeability, stability, temperature range, and other characteristics. Consideration here will be given only to classes of thermistor which are of interest to the metrologist, but it is worth mentioning that there is {{a very large number of}} cruder types, and the number of thermistors produced by all producers in a given year is perhaps in the millions. We will also not consider here, except in a discussion of applications, the many configurations of sheathed, <b>encapsulated,</b> etc., <b>thermistor</b> temperature probes which are available in the marketplace. THEORY OF OPERATION Figure 1 illustrates the property of intrinsic conductivity in a semiconducting solid. In the vicinity of 0 K, all electrons are captured in the valence band, and the conduction band is empty. With increasing temperature, electron movement into the conduction band increases, leaving holes in the valence band. The equilibrium is dynamic, with free I Vacant conduction ban...|$|R
50|$|The most {{practical}} sensor for measuring temperature change in titrating solutions {{has been found}} to be the thermistor. Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature. They are manufactured from sintered mixed metal oxides, with lead wires enabling connection to electrical circuitry. The <b>thermistor</b> is <b>encapsulated</b> in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory heat transfer characteristics and acceptable chemical resistance. Typically for thermistors used for chemical analysis the encapsulating medium is glass, although <b>thermistors</b> <b>encapsulated</b> in epoxy resin may be used in circumstances where either chemical attack (e.g., by acidic fluoride-containing solutions) or severe mechanical stress is anticipated. The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature. The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10−5 K.|$|R
