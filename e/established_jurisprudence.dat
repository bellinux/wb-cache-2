25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the <b>established</b> <b>jurisprudence</b> of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E

Parker argued that the sale of slaves did in fact amount to importation and [...] "claimed the slaves on behalf of the United States as prisoners of war." [...] Almeida v.

So, upon the death of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, on 23 January 1516, Joanna inherited the Crown of Aragon, which consisted of Catalonia, Valencia, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, while Charles became Governor General. Nevertheless, the Flemings wished Charles to assume the royal title, and this was supported by his grandfather the emperor Maximilian I and Pope Leo X.|$|R

50|$|The {{injunction}} in {{this case}} departs {{so far from the}} <b>established</b> <b>jurisprudence</b> of the Supreme Court that in any other context it would have been regarded as a candidate for summary reversal. But since this decision deals with abortion, no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by the Supreme Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The dissent believes that the 36 foot speech-free zone did not meet the burden for the test the Supreme Court set, as it burdens more speech than necessary. The dissent charges that speech-restricting injunctions are deserving of strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court did not award it this level of review {{in this case}} and therefore dissents from all portions of the judgment upholding the injunction.|$|E

40|$|The Court of Justice of EU has {{established}} {{very early in}} its history direct vertical effect of Treaty provisions on free movement of goods. However, direct horizontal effect of the same rules has never been recognized. This paper furthers a following thesis: hypothetical future recognition of direct horizontal effect of the Article 34 and 35 TFEU (prohibition of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and all measures having equivalent effect) would reshape European Economic Constitution and provide basis for more ordoliberal reading of the Treaty. Viewing market freedoms as fundamental constitutional rights on which individuals can rely in private relations is logical consequence of such interpretation.

40|$|The Constitutional Court {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of the German constitution. The most important power of the Court rests in litigable fundamental rights.

Conceptually, this dogmatic tool could become the vessel for a long-standing dream of (some) political scientists. It could turn the Constitutional Court into an authority for assessing political outcomes. The paper demonstrates the many obstacles, originating both from political sciences and from law. They call for high modesty and prudence. But they do not turn the dream into outright utopia. Systems theory, very liberally employed, allows us to define a subsidiary role for the Constitutional Court in assessing political outcomes.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{developing}} national law in Indonesia, Islamic law {{is one of its}} sources. However, there are many misunderstandings of jurists in Indonesia toward Islamic law. The misunderstandings are generally caused by differences of Islamic law and secular law in each subject matters and languages.

Next, we offer a de novo look at the injury and causation issues in this case, and discuss the challenges of an industry reliant on offshored production that sees a safeguard as a mechanism to attract FDI for production. We conclude with an assessment of the operation of the WTO's safeguards regime, along with some tentative suggestions for reform.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of JCE has {{played an important}} role in the jurisprudence of the ECCC, seeing as it was used to convict the accused in both cases that the Court has adjudicated thus far. This case law, although not so voluminous, has quickly managed to attract a lot of attention, largely due to the fact that, in several notable aspects, it deviates from the original legal framework that the UN ad hoc Tribunals have given to this mode of liability. Most significantly, the ECCC rejected the so-called ‘extended’ form of joint criminal enterprise for lacking legal basis in customary international criminal law and only endorsed the ‘basic’ and ‘systemic’ categories of this notion. Moreover, in relation to the latter two, the judges have construed some of their legal elements in a manner that is at odds with the <b>established</b> <b>jurisprudence.</b> The present chapter will review the adoption and evolution of the JCE theory in the ECCC case law, and examine the most notable findings that have been reached on its application in the proceedings brought before the ECCC. The second main part of this chapter will then separately conduct a renewed analysis of the Nuremberg-era cases that have been cited by the modern international tribunals as evidence of the customary nature of the ‘extended’ form of JCE and will, thus, reflect on the ECCC’s decision to reject this form of criminal responsibilit...|$|E
