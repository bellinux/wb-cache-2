40|$|Embodied energy <b>intensities</b> {{denote the}} amount of energy (direct and indirect) that is {{required}} to produce one unit of economic output. These embodied energy <b>intensities</b> should include imports. The energy <b>intensities</b> of imports are in most cases unknown and are therefore often neglected or assumed to be equal to the domestic energy <b>intensities</b> of similar products. Both assumptions introduce errors in the indigenously calculated embodied energy <b>intensities.</b> This certainly applies to countries with a relatively high contribution of imports and a specific economic structure. This article advocates to estimate the energy <b>intensities</b> of imports by means of the average energy <b>intensities</b> of the region in which the country is situated. In this context, different estimation procedures for the embodied energy <b>intensities</b> of imports are presented for a number of countries within OECD-Europe. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.

5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began to turn towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm <b>intensity.</b> The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its <b>intensity,</b> through intermittent bursts of convection, and began to turn towards the northeast.

5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and <b>intensity.</b> Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak <b>intensity</b> just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this <b>intensity,</b> increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E

Early on 15 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone, {{as the storm}} rapidly deepened. The outflow was enhanced by a large upper-level low well to the southeast, and shear had decreased to a minimum. After reaching an initial peak <b>intensity</b> with 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) at 12:00UTC that day, Fantala's <b>intensity</b> leveled off for the following 48 hours, with its 10-minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195km/h (120mph) and 215km/h (130mph).|$|E

5|$|By late on December4, the NHC was {{no longer}} anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm {{and there was no}} interaction. At 0600UTC on December5, the hurricane's {{appearance}} generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate <b>intensity</b> from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85mph (140km/h), which was its peak <b>intensity.</b> Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front.

5|$|Cyclone Connie was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected both Mauritius and Réunion in late January2000. On January24, 2000, a tropical disturbance developed well east of Madagascar. Despite moderate wind shear, it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore, and late on January25, was believed to have attained tropical storm status. After turning generally southeast, Connie attained cyclone <b>intensity</b> on January27. Rapid intensification ensued. Shortly after developing a well-defined eye, Connie attained peak <b>intensity</b> at 0000UTC on January28 as an intense tropical cyclone. Thereafter, Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye. After threatening Mauritius, Connie then turned southwest, passing very close to Réunion late on January28. After briefly leveling off in <b>intensity</b> that evening, Connie soon became less organized, and midday on January29, the eye became less defined. The next day, Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm. Despite forecasts of additional weakening, Connie maintained its <b>intensity</b> for most of January31. However, weakening resumed on February1 and the storm transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on February2. Two days later, Connie merged with another low-pressure area.|$|E
