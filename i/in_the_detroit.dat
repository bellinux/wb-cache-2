5|$|In 1970, I-75 through Detroit was completed, and two {{additional}} sections of M-76 {{were converted to}} freeway. The northern section ran from the US27-to-I-75 transition south of Grayling to the Crawford–Roscommon county line, and the second was an extension from Alger to the West Branch area. The first ice-detection system in the state was installed on the River Rouge bridges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area {{in an attempt to}} maximize driver safety.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 96 {{was mostly}} {{constructed}} in sections that opened from 1957 to 1962, {{but it was}} not completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area until 1977. Even before the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act was signed in 1956, the route was being planned as a replacement of the old US16, which was decommissioned in 1962.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, various freeway {{projects}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> {{area were}} cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled {{in response to}} freeway revolts in the city, and a new routing along the C Railroad right-of-way in Livonia was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53) were dropped. Another freeway project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan and his friends were more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

Later that same year, she struck {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
5|$|Raimi {{asked for}} help and {{assistance}} from several {{of his friends and}} past collaborators to make The Evil Dead. Campbell was cast as Ash Williams, the main character. To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Detroit</b> News. Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.|$|E
5|$|The M-16 {{designation}} {{lasted for}} seven years. As the states were {{meeting with the}} American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, now AASHTO) to plan the United States Numbered Highway System, the route of M-16 was originally planned {{to be included in}} US18. When the system was announced on November 11, 1926, Grand River Avenue and M-16 became part of US16. The first change to the US16 routing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway.|$|E

5|$|The current M-39 is {{the third}} highway to bear the designation. The first dated back to {{the origins of the}} state highway system in 1919 and ran between Grand Rapids and Lansing. This highway was {{replaced}} in segments through the 1920s and 1930s by realignments or extensions of other highways in the area. The second was part of Schaefer Highway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area from 1939 {{until the end of the}} 1950s. The current highway was commissioned when the M-39 designation was moved to Southfield Road from Schaefer Highway. During the 1960s, it was converted into a freeway in stages. Afterwards, it was extended to end at M-85 (Fort Street) before a change in the 1980s gave the trunkline its present termini.|$|E
5|$|The highest numbers {{used for}} highway designations include M-553 in the UP and Interstate 696 (I-696) {{running along the}} {{northern}} Detroit suburbs. The lowest numbers in use are M-1 along Woodward Avenue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area and US Highway 2 (US2) across the UP. Most M-numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under, but some have been designated in the low 300s. MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time. No discernible pattern exists in Michigan's numbering system, {{although most of the}} M-numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{original}} {{sections of}} I-94's predecessor highways <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area were given early names. The westernmost {{of these is}} the Willow Run Expressway, named for the Willow Run complex. The plants at Willow Run produced B-24 Liberator bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{confirmed}} in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She was raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before {{her mother died}} of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birmingham, Alabama, {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} Decatur, Illinois at age11. Prior to his senior year in high school, his family moved to Detroit. In 1945, {{following}} Fonville's lone track season at Detroit's Miller High School, he was named Michigan High School Track & Field Athlete of the Year for his first-place performance at the Detroit City League Meet. Fonville's winning effort in the shot put was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> YMCA Track Championship as a two-man team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, high jump, and shot put. Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs. They were later disqualified for not having four runners. They finished in second place at the meet; their disqualification in the 440 preventing them from winning.|$|E
5|$|Grand River Avenue {{originated}} as an Indian trail before Michigan statehood. It {{later was}} used as a wagon road across the state. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1919 as M-16 and later the United States Numbered Highway System as US16. Construction of a freeway {{along the length of the}} corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. The proposed route for the Jeffries Freeway in Detroit was moved in the 1960s; it was built in the 1970s. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area, closing the last gap along the route. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs.|$|E

5|$|On October 25, 1962, {{the section}} of freeway from M-24 near Pontiac to the Flint area opened. The same year, the freeway gap was filled in between Gaylord and Indian River. The International Bridge and its {{approaches}} opened in Sault Ste. Marie on October 31, 1962. The following year, a set of segments opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area. The freeway was extended south from Pontiac to 11Mile Road with a connection along M-150 to M-102 (8Mile Road). Another section opened to connect with US24 (Telegraph Road) in the Woodhaven area; a TO I-75 designation was added to connect along US24 and M-102 to M-150. On {{the other end of}} the state, the gaps in the freeway across the UP were completed in 1963 as well, and {{the section of}} freeway in Northern Michigan was named the most scenic new highway in the US in 1963 by Parade magazine. The first part of the Chrysler Freeway opened to traffic on June 26, 1964, the southern mile (1.6km) of which was designated I-375.|$|E
5|$|Segments of {{the road}} were {{upgraded}} in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne, Portland and Eagle, and Brighton and Farmington. By 1962, freeway construction allowed motorists to travel between Muskegon and the Lansing area on a freeway, bypassing the old Grand River Avenue route. The final connection between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962. At that time, the US16 designation, which had been applied alongside the I-96 and I-196 designations, was decommissioned. Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers. Sections through Portland, Lansing, Howell, Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations. The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended M-43. Other sections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area became parts of M-102, M-5, or unsigned state highway.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the US25 {{designation}} was decommissioned in Michigan, {{although all}} sections {{of it are}} still state highways. The southern section from the state line northward through Monroe was renumbered M-125 and the US25 designation was removed from US24 (Telegraph Road). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detroit</b> area, the connection between US24 and I-75 in Woodhaven was redesignated as an unsigned connector highway (now Connector 24). The US25 designation was removed from I-75 northward into Detroit, while the routing along Clark Street became an unsigned connector highway (now Connector 850). The routing along Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue was numbered as M-3. The US25 designation was removed from I-94, and the routing through Port Huron and northward to Port Austin became part of an extended M-25. One segment of highway near Port Huron became an unsigned highway now designed Connector 25.|$|E
