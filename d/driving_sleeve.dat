40|$|The pump has {{a holder}} (2) {{for a large}} number of rollers (22) acting against the hose, while a motor (1) {{consists}} of a driving body (11, 12) and a shaft (13) driving the holder. A pressure unit (3) secures the hose in place at the rollers. The body extends at least partly inside the holder, and a bearing (5) can be mounted between them, being typically fixed to the holder. The body can have a <b>driving</b> <b>sleeve</b> (12) at the end towards the holder, a bearing for the shaft being housed inside the sleeve. This bearing can be offset in the axial direction (6) from the first one (5). The pressure unit can be formed by a flap (31, 32), and this and the rollers can be arranged to act simultaneously against several parallel hoses.

30|$|During <b>driving</b> <b>sleeve</b> of cast-in-place piles by {{vibratory}} hammers, soils were {{squeezed into}} sleeve and then soil plugging was formed. The physic-mechanical {{properties of the}} soil plug have direct influence on the load transmission between the sleeve wall and soil plug. Nevertheless, the researches on this issue are insufficient. In this study, finite element and infinite element coupling model was introduced, through the commercial code ABAQUS, to simulate the full penetration process of the sleeve driven from the ground surface to the desired depth by applying vibratory hammers. The research {{results indicated that the}} cyclic shearing action decreases both in soil shear strength and in granular cementation force when the sleeve is driven by vibratory hammers, which leads to a partially plugged mode of the soil plug inside the sleeve. Accordingly, the penetration resistance of sleeve driven by vibratory hammers is the smallest compared to those by other installation methods. When driving the sleeve, the annular soil arches forming in the soil plug at sleeve end induce a significant rise in the internal shaft resistance. Moreover, the influence of vibration frequencies, sleeve diameters, and soil layer properties on the soil plug was investigated in detail, {{and at the same time}} improved formulas were brought forward to describe the soil plug resistance inside vibratory driven sleeve.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{commercial}} code ABAQUS {{was used to}} simulate the sleeve penetration process in all analyses. An explicit solution algorithm was chosen because it is suitable for problems with large deformations and complex contact conditions. The degree of soil plug and arching effect during vibratory <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving</b> were investigated in the following. At the same time, the influence of vibratory frequencies, sleeve diameters and soil layer properties on the soil plugging was discussed at length, and improved formulas of the soil plug resistance were presented.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  16, {{the value of}} soil plug {{resistance}} of numerical solution is slightly {{greater than that of}} analytic solution at the early stage of <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving.</b> When the <b>sleeve</b> reaches a certain depth, the numerical solution agrees well with analytic solution, and this certain depth is defined as minimum critical depth. Because the arching effect is weak during the penetration of sleeve, the soil plug resistance is withstood by the whole soil plug. As a result, the numerical solution obtained from the integral along the sleeve length is larger than the analytic solution obtained from the integral along the active height of soil plug. When the sleeve is driven into deep soil layers, an obvious arching effect occurs in soil plug. At this time, the soils within the active height of soil plug undertake the major part of the soil plug resistance, and soil plug resistance obtained from the numerical simulation is identical to that given by analytic study. As the penetration depth increases, a maximum critical depth exists in the penetration process. When the penetration depth is deeper than the maximum critical depth, the numerical solution of soil plug resistance is smaller than analytic solution. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} fact that the cyclic shearing and sliding between the sleeve wall and deep soils lead to plastic failure in soils.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is not required}} to host valves, allowing the spark plug to be placed in the best possible location for efficient ignition of the combustion mixture. For very big engines, where flame propagation speed limits both size and speed, the swirl induced by ports, as described by Harry Ricardo can be an additional advantage. In his research with two-stroke single sleeve valve compression ignition engines, Harry Ricardo proved that an open sleeve was feasible, acting as a second annular piston with 10% of the central piston area, that transmitted 3% of the power to the output shaft through the <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving</b> mechanism. This highly simplifies construction, as the 'junk head' is no longer needed.|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{also shows}} the stress arch is most obvious {{within a certain}} range from the sleeve end. Within the range, the soil plug {{undertakes}} the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance, and the stress value increases with the penetration depth. The simulation results accord with the study of Lobo-Guerrero and Vallejo (2007), the contact stress mainly was concentrated at the bottom of sleeve end, and was delivered to the interior of the sleeve in a short distance from the sleeve end. During sleeve jacking, the void ratio is slightly smaller than the void ratio in initial stress state due to the monotonic shear between the soils and sleeve wall. Compared to the sleeve jacking, the arching effect of vibratory <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving</b> is relatively weaker, since the cyclic shear between the soils and sleeve wall makes void ratio decrease to the minimum value (Henke and Grabe 2008). The soil plug is compacted under vibratory action, which makes the soils at the bottom of sleeve difficult to be squeezed into the sleeve. Consequently, the arching effect is relatively weaker.|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{researches}} of soil plugging effect {{focused on}} the soil plugging mechanisms of jacked or impact-driven pipe piles, instead of vibro-driven pipe piles. However, {{the difference between the}} sleeve of cast-in-place piles and pipe piles is obvious, especially when the sleeve diameter is larger or the sleeve wall thickness is thinner, which is vital to the performance of soil plug (Lehane and Gavin 2001; Randolph 2003). The vibratory <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving</b> is a complex mechanical process with respect to the interaction between the sleeve wall and the soils. It involves strong disturbance of the surrounding soils induced by vibration and extrusion, as well as the cyclic shearing and sliding between the sleeve wall and soils. In recent years, some researches on soil plugging effect during vibratory pipe piles driving were conducted according to Henke and Grabe (2008); however, these researches only {{focused on the}} soil plugging effect based on the analysis of the radial stress of the soils inside and outside the pile wall. Therefore, more researches with respect to the degree of soil plug, arching effect and influence should be investigated.|$|R
30|$|The {{numerical}} modelling of pile penetration into stiff clays, where the pile was pre-drilled {{to a depth}} of 18  m and only the last hammer blows were simulated,was presented by Mabsout and Tassoulas (1994). Soon afterward, a special finite element analysis technique called “zipper-type” was successfully used to simulate the pile installation process. In this modelling technique, a reserved hole with a diameter of 1  % of the pile diameter was simulated in the axis of penetration. This reserve hole was able to expand so that the contact between the soils and pile was established in the penetration process of sleeve. To analyze the soil plugging effect in the open-end pipe pile, Henke and Grabe (2008) developed the {{numerical modelling}} of driving open-end pipe pile into soils using the “zipper-type” technique. In their model, a rigid tube of 1  mm wall thickness was created along the open-end pipe pile wall, it penetrated throughout the whole soil layer. Before penetration of pile, the interaction between the pipe pile and soils was assumed to be frictionless. During pile penetration, the pipe pile slided over the rigid tube, and separated the soils from rigid tube. By taking this method, the contact between the driven pile and surrounding soils could be established. The Coulomb friction model was used throughout all analyses for the contact. Due to the full penetration of the rigid tube, the soils {{at the bottom of the}} pipe pile couldn’t plug into the pipe pile, which produced a certain influence on the result of soil plugging. This paper simulates the vibratory <b>driving</b> of <b>sleeve,</b> and a rigid tube with a thickness of 1  mm is modelled along the sleeve wall to allow penetration of sleeve (Fig.  1). However, the length of the rigid tube in this model is the same as that of the sleeve, which does not penetrate throughout the whole layer. As the sleeve is being driven, the soils at the bottom of the rigid tube can plug into the sleeve. Therefore, numerical modelling can provide a more precise simulation of the soil plug.|$|R
50|$|An {{inherent}} disadvantage is {{that the}} piston in its course partially obscures the ports, thus {{making it difficult for}} gases to flow during the crucial overlap between the intake and exhaust valve timing usual in modern engines. Mike Hewland admitted this was a problem at speeds above 10,000 rpm in his engines aimed at racing, but in the middle range, SSV was always better than a poppet valve engine. The 1954 printing of the book by Harry Ricardo: 'The high-speed internal combustion engine', and also some patents on sleeve valve production, point out that the available zone for ports in the sleeve depends on the type of sleeve drive and bore/stroke ratio; Ricardo tested successfully the 'open sleeve' concept in some two-stroke, compression ignition engines. It not only eliminated the head rings, but also allowed a reduction in height of the engine and head, thus reducing frontal area in an aircraft engine, the whole circumference of the sleeve being available for exhaust port area, and the sleeve acting in phase with the piston forming an annular piston with an area around 10% of that of the piston, that contributed to some 3% of power output through the <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving</b> mechanism to the crankshaft. The German-born engineer Max Bentele, after studying a British sleeve valve aero engine (probably a Hercules), complained that the arrangement required more than 100 gearwheels for the engine, too many for his taste.|$|R
30|$|According to the coupled finite-infinite element {{modelling}} of sleeve penetration by vibratory hammers, {{the soil}} plugging effect during the penetration was investigated. The main conclusions were as followings: (1) During vibratory <b>sleeve</b> <b>driving,</b> the soil strength and cohesion decrease, which is induced by cyclic shearing action. As a result, soil plug is partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance {{is less than}} those by other installation methods; (2) In the vibratory penetration process, annular soil arches form inside the soil plug, which induces an obvious increase in internal shaft resistance. The soils within the active height of the soil plug undertake the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance; (3) A threshold value exists in the influence of the vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance. When the vibration frequency is less than the threshold value, internal shaft resistance decreases with the increase in vibratory frequency, which correspondingly reduces the degree of soil plug. When the vibration frequency reaches the threshold value, the influence of vibration frequency on internal shaft resistance can be ignored. Hence, the vibration frequency has little influence on the degree of soil plug; (4) The internal shaft resistance of the sleeve end gradually decreases as the sleeve diameter increases, while the internal shaft resistance in {{the upper part of the}} sleeves increases as the sleeve diameter increases. Moreover, the increase in sleeve diameter gradually decreases the degree of the soil plug. The internal shaft resistance depends closely on the soil layer properties as well; (5) During penetration of the sleeve, the distribution of soil plug resistance along the height of soil plug can be described by index curve. Soil plug resistance is mainly undertaken by the soils within the active height of soil plug. At the same time, the analytic expression of soil plug resistance during vibratory driving was given under the conditions of f ≥  25  Hz and 3.2 D < H <  15.5 D.|$|R
