5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were <b>ingrained</b> <b>in</b> ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was {{populated}} by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
