2500|$|I {{could never}} analyse why, {{right from the}} outset, {{sections}} of the New Zealand crowds had taken a set against Greg. Perhaps it was his jaunty manner on the field.

25|$|The party still {{failed to}} present a true {{challenge}} to the Liberal government, since its agenda was seen as too extreme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> central and eastern Canada. A notable exception was rural central Ontario, an area that was almost as socially conservative as Reform's western heartland. However, due to massive vote splitting with the PCs, this support only translated into one seat in Ontario during its 1993 breakthrough--the only seat that the party ever won east of Manitoba. That seat was lost in 1997.|$|R
40|$|AbstractJust lately it {{has become}} popular to rename your {{semiconductor}} company. Everyone seems to be re-badging themselves with names that dare to be different but that are less meaningful than their old ones. Some very sensible companies are discarding their brand-names in a vogue-ish streamlining and restructuring that is leaving many of us puzzled. Why cast off well-known and trusted names <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>of</b> Agilent, Conexant, Infineon, Lucent, or simply ‘ON’?

2500|$|Reform's {{emergence}} fragmented {{the conservative}} vote into two parts– Reform and the weakened PC Party. [...] Reform was generally seen as too extreme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>liking</b> <b>of</b> {{urban and suburban}} voters east of Manitoba. [...] Conflicts with the federal PCs resulted in wasted resources, donor frustration, {{the lack of a}} coherent provincial political machine for either party, and vote splitting during elections. [...] Reform was never able to gain footing in Atlantic Canada or Quebec; it was not only hampered by Manning's inability to speak French, but its uncompromising stances on federalism and official bilingualism. [...] As it is nearly impossible to form a government without substantial support in both Ontario and Quebec, the Liberal Party was seen as having a secure hold on power.|$|R

25|$|Warrant {{was formed}} in 1984 by guitarist Erik Turner who had {{previously}} {{been a member of}} Knightmare II (along with future Warrant guitarist Joey Allen). The first line up included lead vocalist Adam Shore, drummer Max Asher (born Max Mazursky/Masursky), guitarist Josh Lewis (born Josh Cohen), and bassist Chris Vincent, who was quickly replaced by Jerry Dixon. The band gigged hard in California opening <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane, Ted Nugent, Stryper and Black 'n Blue among others. In September 1986, Shore and Asher quit to create Hot Wheelz. Later that month Erik Turner was at a gig watching a band called Plain Jane who had become a regular feature in the L.A. club circuit and he was impressed by the band's songwriting and vocal performance, and invited lead singer Jani Lane and drummer Steven Sweet (born Steven Chamberlin/Chamberlain) to jam with his band at Hollywood's db Sound in September 1986. Lane and Sweet, along with guitarist Joey Allen (born Joey Cagle),who replaced Lewis, completed the revamped lineup in 1987.

After Szymczyk convinced King that he could improve his sound to make him more appealing to a wider audience, King himself agreed to let Szymczyk produce for him. Among the albums he produced for King are the 1969 live album Live & Well, King's first ever top-100 album. He produced his follow-up studio album Completely Well, which featured [...] "The Thrill Is Gone", the biggest hit of King's career and his signature song.

500|$|Throughout this period, Harrison's {{devotion to}} Hindu spirituality – {{particularly}} to Krishna consciousness via {{his friendship with}} A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – reached new heights. As Harrison admitted, his adherence to his spiritual path was not necessarily consistent. His wife, Pattie Boyd, and their friend Chris O'Dell would joke {{that it was hard}} to tell whether he was dipping into his ever-present Japa Yoga prayer bag or [...] "the coke bag". This duality has been noted by Harrison biographers Simon Leng and Alan Clayson: on one hand, Harrison earned himself the nickname [...] "His Lectureship" [...] during his prolonged periods of fervid devotion; on the other, he participated in bawdy London sessions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Bobby Keys' eponymous solo album and what Leng terms Harry Nilsson's [...] "thoroughly nasty" [...] "You're Breakin' My Heart", both recorded in the first half of 1972.

500|$|In 1968, Jarrell and {{his wife}} opened WJ Studio and Gallery, below their home and studio.

Jarrell's love for blues and jazz music {{made it easy for}} him to access the city's talent and his {{involvement}} with OCAC provided him with contacts in the poetry world. Artists such as Muhal Richard Abrams, John Stubblefield, Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton and the Chicago Art Ensemble would perform at the space. The gallery also served as a gathering place <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Gerald Williams and others, who would come to discuss concepts of a relevant black art aesthetic. The group struggled: Jarrell described the search as an attempt to find [...] "a collective concept that would say 'black art' at a glance." [...] Eventually, the group made a breakthrough while listing principles and ideas regarding the concept of black art; the term [...] "coolade colors" [...] was contributed by a fabric designer. The term covered the bright fashion of stylish African American men of the time, which Jarrell described as [...] "loud lime, pimp yellows, hot pinks, high-key color clothing." [...] The final concept for their aesthetic search would be message oriented art, revolving around socially aware content. African design would be included and meaningfulness for black people would be a necessity. This group's formation would be considered one of the best aligned and organized collectives in the Black Arts Movement. This group went on to form COBRA.|$|E
