2500|$|In {{the same}} year Alexander Ginzburg, an {{employee}} in Golitsyn's institute, developed a model of dust storms to describe the cooling phenomenon on Mars. Golitsyn felt that his model would be applicable to soot after he read a 1982 Swedish magazine dedicated {{to the effects of}} a hypothetical nuclear war between the USSR and the USA. Golitsyn would use Ginzburg's largely unmodified <b>dust-cloud</b> model with soot assumed as the aerosol in the model instead of soil dust and in an identical fashion to the results returned, when computing <b>dust-cloud</b> cooling in the Martian atmosphere, the cloud high above the planet would be heated while the planet below would cool drastically. Golitsyn presented his intent to publish this Martian derived Earth-analog model to the Andropov instigated Committee of Soviet Scientists in Defence of Peace Against the Nuclear Threat in May 1983, an organization that Golitsyn would later be appointed a position of vice-chairman of. The establishment of this committee was done with the expressed approval of the Soviet leadership with the intent [...] "to expand controlled contacts with Western [...] "nuclear freeze" [...] activists". [...] Having gained this committees approval, in September 1983, Golitsyn published the first computer model on the nascent [...] "nuclear winter" [...] effect in the widely read Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Balaam and Balak went {{together}} to Kiriath-huzoth, where Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and they ate. In the morning, Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-Baal, overlooking the Israelites. Balaam had Balak build seven altars, and they offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. Then Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone {{to see if}} God would grant him a manifestation. God appeared to Balaam and told him what to say. Balaam returned and said: [...] "How can I damn whom God has not damned, how doom when the Lord has not doomed? [...] [...] [...] [...] Who can count the dust of Jacob, number the <b>dust-cloud</b> of Israel? [...] May I die {{the death of the}} upright, may my fate be like theirs!" [...] Balak complained that he had brought Balaam to damn the Israelites, but instead Balaam blessed them. Balaam replied that he could only repeat what God put in his mouth.|$|E
60|$|Slingerland sat {{his horse}} and watched while he waited. The <b>dust-cloud</b> that marked the troops drew farther away.|$|E
60|$|A {{strong breeze}} drove {{blinding}} <b>dust-clouds</b> through the place, {{but even in}} the wind the sunshine was scorching.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>dust-clouds,</b> {{now like}} reddened smoke, puffed over the ridge. A horse {{carrying}} a dark, thick figure appeared above the sage.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's makin' them <b>dust-clouds</b> on the sage? Antelope? ... Holley, {{you used}} to have eyes better 'n me. Use them, will you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>dust-cloud</b> {{down the}} road came from a string of automobiles, flying along at express speed. Kurt saw them with relief.|$|E
6000|$|So in vain {{the barren}} hillsides with their gay serapes blazed,-- [...] Blazed and {{vanished}} in the <b>dust-cloud</b> that their flying hoofs had [...] raised.|$|E
60|$|The long, white, bobbing line of steers {{streaked}} swiftly {{through the}} sage, and a funnel-shaped <b>dust-cloud</b> arose {{at a low}} angle. A dull rumbling filled Jane's ears.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{catching}} his breath. She was perfectly quiet. He looked {{on down the}} winding road. There were <b>dust-clouds</b> in the distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe you'll {{make them}} out," [...] said August. [...] "I can't, and I've watched those <b>dust-clouds</b> for hours. George can't decide, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|Light breezes blow {{toward the}} French, {{and they get}} in their faces [...] the <b>dust-clouds</b> and smoke from the masses of English in motion, and [...] a {{powerful}} sun in their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|X. [...] "'Tis he!--'tis he!'--all arm and run [...] Towards the Marar Plain, [...] Where a dark {{horseman}} {{rides the}} waste [...] With <b>dust-cloud</b> for a train.|$|E
60|$|The players {{pretended to}} be exhilarated by practising service, but they startled at each <b>dust-cloud</b> from a motor car. None of the cars turned into the meadow-none till a quarter to four, when Kennicott drove in.|$|E
60|$|There was the <b>dust-cloud</b> {{rolling up}} the hill in front of us, and through it we had a shadowy peep of the backs of our opponents, with a flash of brass-work and a gleam of scarlet.|$|E
60|$|A shout {{rose above}} the hubbub of voices. A tall man was {{pointing}} across the gulch where <b>dust-clouds</b> showed above the willows. Men crowded round him, all gazing {{in the direction of}} his hand, all talking at once.|$|R
50|$|The {{track was}} based on European road-racing courses. Unfortunately, it was more {{challenging}} that {{what a lot of}} amateur drivers in America were accustomed with. It had no wide run-off areas that American amateurs were used to. Additionally, {{the first few days of}} racing at the track were faced with high winds that created <b>dust-clouds</b> which obstructed the vision of drivers. In addition, these <b>dust-clouds</b> filthied spectators, making for upset crowds. Reports of massive traffic jams on nearby roads, and a long walk from the track's parking area only added to the difficulties faced by the newly opened race track. Management attempted to solve the track's problems, but there just wasn't enough cash for them to make all the alterations that were needed.|$|R
60|$|The great brown cloud quickly {{began to}} lose its spherical form, part of it {{descending}} heavily to the earth, and part floating away in vast <b>dust-clouds</b> borne inland by the breeze, settling downward as they moved, and depositing on land, water, ships, houses, domes, and trees an almost impalpable powder.|$|R
60|$|The sheep {{raised a}} <b>dust-cloud</b> in the sandy wash {{where the road}} wound down, and Lucy hung back to let them get farther ahead. Gradually the tiny roar of pattering hoofs and the blended bleating and baaing died away. The <b>dust-cloud,</b> however, hung {{over the head of}} the ravine, and Lucy had to force Sarchedon through it. Sarchedon did not mind sand and dust, but he surely hated the smell of sheep. Lucy seldom put a spur to Sarchedon; still, she gave him a lash with her quirt, and then he went on obediently, if disgustedly. He carried his head like a horse that {{wondered}} why his mistress preferred to drive him down into an unpleasant hole when she might have been cutting the sweet, cool sage wind up on the slope.|$|E
60|$|The French {{had already}} {{experienced}} {{that they had}} no chance of overtaking the Arabs, and the cavalry accordingly paid no attention to so small a party, but continued their journey at a trot. After riding for four or five miles they were left far behind by the tribesmen, but the <b>dust-cloud</b> showed their position.|$|E
60|$|Grant's {{face was}} a trifle grim {{when he saw that}} more of the horses were {{inclined}} to behave similarly, but he flicked his team with the whip, and there was cheering and derision when, with a drumming of hoofs and rattle of wheels, wagons and horsemen swept away into the <b>dust-cloud</b> that rolled about the trail.|$|E
60|$|Amowee, where I {{arrived at}} 9 p.m., {{is on an}} open grassy flat, about fifteen miles from the Ganges, which is seen from the neighbourhood, flowing among trees, with the white houses, domes, and temples of Mirzapore {{scattered}} around, and high above which the <b>dust-clouds</b> were coursing along the horizon.|$|R
60|$|The rapid {{pounding}} of the stallion's hoofs drowned the clatter {{coming up the}} trail. A backward glance relieved Hare, for <b>dust-clouds</b> some few hundred yards in the rear showed {{the position of the}} pursuing horsemen. He held in Silvermane to a steady gallop. The trail was up-hill, and steep enough to wind even a desert racer, if put to his limit.|$|R
60|$|Hare, {{looking at}} Snap, was {{attracted}} by the eyes from which his father and brothers expected so much. If ever a human being had {{the eyes of a}} hawk Snap Naab had them. The little brown flecks danced in clear pale yellow. Evidently Snap had not located the perplexing <b>dust-clouds,</b> for his glance drifted. Suddenly the remarkable vibration of his pupils ceased, and his glance grew fixed, steely, certain.|$|R
60|$|By and by {{they ran}} {{down into a}} narrow dale {{in the depths of}} which a river brawled among the stones, and climbed a long ascent, from which they could see a moving <b>dust-cloud</b> {{indicating}} that Mrs. Kettering's car was only a mile or two behind. After that there was a league of brown heath, and then they sped down to a wide, wooded valley, in the midst of which rose the gray walls of an ancient town. On reaching it, Ethel alighted in the market-square, hard by the lofty abbey, and turned to Bland.|$|E
60|$|Whenever we are {{visited by}} a dust-storm on the pampas myriads of hooded gulls--Larus macnlipen-nis--appear flying before the dark <b>dust-cloud,</b> even when not a gull {{has been seen}} for months. Dust-storms are of rare occurrence, and come only after a long drought, and, the water-courses being all dry, the gulls cannot {{have been living in}} the region over which the storm passes. Yet in seasons of drought gulls must be {{continually}} passing by at a great height, seeing but not seen, except when driven together and forced towards the earth by the fury of the storm.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the Sessionses' flat and fell upon the gossip of Panama, Pennsylvania, Una was absent-minded--except when the Sessionses teased her about Henry Carson and Charlie Martindale. The rest of the time, curled up on a black-walnut couch which she had known for years in Panama, and which looked plaintively rustic here in New York, Una gave herself up to {{impressions}} of the city: the voices of many children down on Amsterdam Avenue, the shriek of a flat-wheeled surface car, the sturdy pound of trucks, horns of automobiles; the separate sounds scarcely distinguishable in a whirr which seemed visible as a thick, gray-yellow <b>dust-cloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Majesty!" [...] he exclaimed. There was amaze in {{the voice}} usually so even and well modulated--amaze in the {{handsome}} face usually so indifferent. Her question had startled him. She saw him look down the iron-gray cliffs, over the barren slopes and cedared ridges, beyond the cactus-covered foothills to the grim and ghastly desert. Just then, with its red veils of sunlit <b>dust-clouds,</b> its illimitable waste of ruined and upheaved earth, it was a sinister spectacle.|$|R
6000|$|To me, {{in these}} circumstances, that of [...] "Hero-worship" [...] becomes a fact inexpressibly precious; the most solacing fact one {{sees in the}} world at present. There is an {{everlasting}} hope in it for the management of the world. Had all traditions, arrangements, creeds, societies that men ever instituted, sunk away, this would remain. The certainty of Heroes being sent us; our faculty, our necessity, to reverence Heroes when sent: it shines like a polestar through smoke-clouds, <b>dust-clouds,</b> and all manner of down-rushing and conflagration.|$|R
60|$|But Joan was at homein Paradise, I might say. She sat up straight, and I {{could see}} that she was feeling {{different}} from me. The awfulest thing was the silence; there wasn't a sound but the screaking of the saddles, the measured tramplings, and the sneezing of the horses, afflicted by the smothering <b>dust-clouds</b> which they kicked up. I wanted to sneeze myself, but {{it seemed to me that}} I would rather go unsneezed, or suffer even a bitterer torture, if there is one, than attract attention to myself.|$|R
60|$|At length the wady got wider, and {{peering through}} the <b>dust-cloud,</b> he saw the sea. The launch had not gone and the {{lifeboat}} {{was coming from the}} steamer. Kit thought this strange, since the launch would carry all, but perhaps Don Erminio had sent to find out why they had not returned. The surf was high and a man on board the launch stood up and waved his arms, as if he signalled the party to be quick. Then the dust got very thick and boats and surf vanished. Juan shouted, but Kit did not hear what he said. They were all running as fast as possible, slipping and stumbling across the stones.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning a}} week or two after his meeting with Beatrice, Harding drove his {{rattling}} engine across the plowed land. His face was sooty, his overalls were stained with grease, and now and then a shower of cinders fell about his head. Behind him Devine stood {{in the midst of a}} <b>dust-cloud,</b> regulating the bite of the harrows that tossed about the hard, dry clods. It was good weather for preparing the seedbed, and the men had been busy since sunrise, making the most of it. Spring comes suddenly in the Northwest, the summer is hot but short, and the grain must be sown early if it is to escape the autumn frost.|$|E
6000|$|Patience, O Dumouriez! This {{uncertain}} heap of shriekers, mutineers, {{were they}} once drilled and inured, {{will become a}} phalanxed mass of Fighters; and wheel and whirl, to order, swiftly like the wind or the whirlwind: tanned mustachio-figures; often barefoot, even bare-backed; with sinews of iron; who require only bread and gunpowder: very Sons of Fire, the adroitest, hastiest, hottest ever seen perhaps since Attila's time. They may conquer and overrun amazingly, much as that same Attila did;--whose Attila's-Camp and Battlefield thou now seest, on this very ground; (Helen Maria Williams, iii. 32.) who, after sweeping bare the world, was, with difficulty, and days of tough fighting, checked here by Roman Aetius and Fortune; and his <b>dust-cloud</b> made to vanish in the East again!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The air was {{cooling down}} toward evening at Sebastian, where an unpicturesque {{collection}} {{of wooden houses}} stand upon a branch line on the Canadian prairie. The place is not attractive during the earlier portion of the short northern summer, when for {{the greater part of}} every week it lies sweltering in heat, in spite of the strong west winds that drive <b>dust-clouds</b> through its rutted streets. As a rule, during the remaining day or two the temperature sharply falls, thunder crashes between downpours of heavy rain, and the wet plank sidewalks provide a badly-needed refuge from the cement-like [...] "gumbo" [...] mire.|$|R
60|$|<b>Dust-clouds</b> {{far ahead}} caused his alarm to grow. He watched {{with his eyes}} strained; he hoped to see a wagon, a few stray cattle. But no, he soon descried several horsemen. Shots and yells behind him attested {{to the fact that}} his pursuers {{likewise}} had seen these new-comers on the scene. More than a mile separated these two parties, yet that distance did not keep them from soon understanding each other. Duane waited only to see this new factor show signs of sudden quick action, and then, with a muttered curse, he spurred his horse off the road into the brush.|$|R
60|$|One day, {{however, the}} breeze backed North {{and the boat}} could not leave the ship. It blew hard, and big, hollow-fronted seas rolled along the coast. In the distance, their ragged crests cut the sky, and the horizon was {{indented}} like {{the edge of a}} saw. In the foreground they crashed upon the shoals, and all about Mossamedes one saw spouting foam. Brown <b>dust-clouds</b> tossed behind the yellow streak that marked the coast, and the sky was darkened as if by smoke. Macallister was ready to start his engines, but the lead-line that crossed the steamer's rail ran straight down. Although she plunged, her anchor held.|$|R
