In 2016, North Melbourne introduced a new logo that featured a much fiercer looking kangaroo, with its head only, {{sitting on top of}} the words 'North Melbourne' inside a shield. The change was welcomed as the previous logo (2007-2016) didn't seem to represent what they stood for or the direction they were heading.

25|$|As these {{investigations}} continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been {{claimed that the}} Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.

For example, one of {{the names on the}} list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> the hundreds of other names on these lists.|$|E
25|$|Every year, {{more than}} 200,000 {{individuals}} see their physicians concerning chemosensory problems, {{and many more}} taste disturbances are never reported. Due to {{the large number of}} persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country. These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function.

25|$|The City of Chicago <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> a {{plan for}} an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E
25|$|While US Airways made immense cuts {{in service}} {{during the early}} 21st century, other {{carriers}} began to play a more dominant role at PIT. The airport's operator, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, has attempted to attract new service to the airport, particularly low-cost and international carriers. AirTran Airways, which had trouble competing in Pittsburgh after beginning service in 2000, was able to expand Pittsburgh offerings after the US Airways cuts. In 2003, USA3000 Airlines began service to Florida and subsequently expanded to include international destinations in the Caribbean. Southwest Airlines began service to Pittsburgh in May 2005 and broke US Airways's monopolies on Tampa, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Philadelphia, and brought more competition to the Chicago and Orlando markets. As of March 2017, Southwest served 17 destinations from the airport, {{more than any other}} incumbent carrier. JetBlue Airways began service on June 30, 2006 with flights to Boston-Logan and New York-Kennedy, thus in turn breaking US Airways' monopoly on Boston and added more competition to the New York market. Myrtle Beach Direct Air began service in March 2007. Combined increases in competition and diversification of carriers at the airport led to a decline in average airfares by roughly 30%, lowering notoriously high fares once commonplace for the airport. In May 2015, it was announced that Southwest Airlines <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> possibly expanding in Pittsburgh and maybe even call PIT one of its focus cities. In September 2015, Toronto based regional carrier Porter Airlines began daily non-stop service from Pittsburgh to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.|$|E
