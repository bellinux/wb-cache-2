25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509. At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States. The main difference is that patented <b>drug</b> <b>prices</b> in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher. The price differential for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US in drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S, the National Report Card on Adherence rates Americans {{with chronic}} medical {{conditions}} with a grade C+ on adherence to their medication and this contributes {{to an estimated}} cost of $290 Billion annually. Increase in patient medication cost share {{was found to be}} associated with low adherence to medication. The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs which is one of factors leading to the high healthcare costs. This is mainly attributed to the government's lack of ability to negotiate lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with the brand name drugs. In order to manage the medication costs, many patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription or skip or reduce doses. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, approximately three quarters (73%) of the public think the <b>drug</b> <b>prices</b> are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and “quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses”. In comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.|$|E

40|$|This article {{theoretically}} {{evaluates the}} <b>drug</b> <b>pricing</b> policy in Japan and suggest an alternative more efficient policy. The Japanese current pricing rule “R 2 rule” causes high <b>drug</b> <b>price</b> and social inefficiency {{that is similar}} to the well-known double marginalisation problem. To solve this problem, we derive an alternative pricing rule that we name “margin rate rule”. We show that the margin rate rule improves Pareto efficiency: the rule leads to both lower <b>drug</b> <b>price</b> and higher profit of the firms. There are three notable advantages in the margin rate rule. First, the government does not have to estimate the demand function, though it has the target price. The pharmaceutical firms, not the government, estimate drug efficacy, competition, and other demand information in <b>pricing</b> <b>drugs.</b> In this sense, the margin rate rule is a decentralised rule, and easy to manage. Second, the government can control the profit share between the firms and pharmacies in order to encourage pharmaceutical innovation. Third, the government can also control the drug-price margins so that meditations are not biased...|$|R
