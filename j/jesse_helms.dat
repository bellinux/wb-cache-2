5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms,</b> Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving another term.

5000|$|The {{center has}} a {{collection}} of elephants, the symbol of Helms' Republican Party, but Helms also {{had an interest in}} the animals since childhood. There is a [...] "Free Enterprise Hall of Fame" [...] within the center. Helms honors several individuals who were key influences in his life, including his father, <b>Jesse</b> Alexander <b>Helms,</b> Sr., the police and fire chief in nearby Monroe, North Carolina; the late U.S Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia, and former U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. Between the first and second floors of the center is a timeline of various events in Helms' life. He posts headlines of his successful senatorial elections in 1972, 1978, 1984, 1990, and 1996. Helms is shown in photos with, all the presidents with whom he served from Richard M. Nixon to George W.

25|$|The Smithsonian Board of Regents {{agreed in}} September 1991 to draft museum legislation, and {{submitted}} their bill to Congress in February 1992. The bill was criticized by Tom Mack {{and others for}} putting the museum in a building that was too small and old to properly house the intended collection, and despite winning approval in both House and Senate committees the bill died once more. In 1994, Senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> refused to allow the legislation {{to come to the}} Senate floor (voicing both fiscal and philosophical concerns) despite bipartisan support.|$|E
25|$|He {{was elected}} Governor of Massachusetts in 1990 and was {{governor}} from 1991 to 1997.

He resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President Bill Clinton to serve as United States Ambassador to Mexico, but because of opposition by the social conservative Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms,</b> he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination.|$|E
25|$|However, Senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> {{introduced}} {{legislation that would}} stop the NEA from funding artwork he considered “obscene.” The legislation subsequently required any recipients of NEA funds to sign an oath that declared they would not promote obscenity. The oath provoked protests from artists and arts organizations. When, during the next grant cycle, in this climate of fear, applications for support equaling {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars were rejected. Outraged artists filed lawsuits against the agency. A compromise was reached in Congress. Although the radically restrictive Helms amendment did not pass, restrictions were placed on NEA funding procedures.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Hansen {{supported}} the renomination and reelection of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., who won Wyoming's three electoral votes. His backing of Ford {{was consistent with}} the stand of his Republican Senate colleagues that year; only two, Paul Laxalt of Nevada and <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> of North Carolina, endorsed Ford's rival for the nomination, Ronald W. Reagan of California. Hansen retired from the Senate in 1978, when he declined to run for a third term. He moved back to Jackson and chaired several financial and civic associations.

25|$|In late December 2001, Dole {{shifted her}} {{official}} residency from the Doles' condominium in the Watergate complex to her mother's home in Salisbury to seek {{election to the}} U.S. Senate. The seat was made available by the retirement of Republican <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms.</b> Although Dole had not lived regularly in North Carolina since 1959 and had been {{a resident of the}} Washington area for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the state and national Republican establishment quickly cleared the field for her. She handily won the Republican primary with 80 percent of the vote over a lesser-known candidate, Dr. Ada Fisher. In the November general election, she defeated her Democratic opponent Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, by an eight-point margin.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including agency fee clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban agency fee agreements, there was no governmental action {{on which to base}} a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge agency fee payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms,</b> Dan Quayle, Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Illinois Senator made {{headlines}} when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed {{for nearly a}} century, and despite the Judiciary Committee’s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize {{the extension of the}} federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.” Swayed by Moseley Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist political agendas in the United States. Republican politician and past Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council. In 1996, a Charleston, SC, drive-by shooting by Klan members of three African American males occurred after a Council rally; Dylann Roof, responsible for the 2015 murder of nine Emanuel AME church members in Charleston, espoused Council of Conservative Citizens rhetoric in a manifesto.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999, Holbrooke was sworn-in as the 22nd U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, {{replacing}} Bill Richardson. During his tenure, Holbrooke {{was known}} for innovation and for achieving diplomatic breakthroughs that settled a series of longstanding tensions in the United States' relationship with the UN. His highest-profile accomplishment was negotiating a historic deal between the United States and the UN's then 188-Member States to settle the bulk of arrears owed by the United States to the United Nations. The deal, achieved with the agreement of the UN's entire membership in late December 2000, lowered the rate of UN dues paid by the United States to the UN, fulfilling {{the terms of a}} US law championed by Senators <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> (R-NC) and Joseph Biden (D-DE). In return for the reduction, the US paid the UN over $900 million in back dues. Holbrooke secured a reduction in US dues to the UN despite a booming American economy by enfolding the US position within a broad push to update the UN's long-outdated financial system. As negotiations reached a critical phase in the fall of 2000, Holbrooke bridged a gap between what the US was legally permitted to pay and the amounts the rest of the UN membership were willing to shoulder by securing an unprecedented contribution by billionaire Ted Turner, founder of the UN Foundation. Holbrooke and his team received a standing ovation in the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the terms of the deal were presented.|$|E
500|$|Save Our Children also {{received}} help {{from outside the}} area. North Carolina senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> offered his staff and funding from the Congressional Club, and wrote in his column that {{he was proud of}} Bryant: [...] "I have pledged my full support to her ... She is fighting for decency and morality in America—and that makes her, in my book, an all-American lady". Pastor Jerry Falwell from Lynchburg, Virginia lent his support during visits and with the appearance of B. Larry Coy, who served as a marriage counselor to Bryant and Green. Coy and Green took over management of Bryant's ministries.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Senator <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> {{attempted}} {{to cut off}} financial aid to Nicaragua. [...] In his report to the Senate, he stated that the Sandinistas were still controlling much of the Nicaraguan administration and suggested that the Nicaraguan government replace all former Sandinista officers with ex-Contras, replace all judges, and return all property that was taken from US citizens during the revolution. [...] Chamorro's administration denied Helm's allegations while still trying to comply with his demands. [...] Helms managed to sway opinion in Congress and the US government denied Nicaragua the $104 million that had been promised for that year. The aid was cut-off and Helms' demands were put forward the month after Chamorro withdrew the compensation claims associated with the Nicaragua vs. United States verdict.|$|E
500|$|The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA) {{went into}} effect in 2002, {{creating}} a credit freeze of the Zimbabwean government through Section 4 C, Multilateral Financing Restriction. The bill was sponsored by Bill Frist, and co-sponsored by senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Russ Feingold and <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms.</b> [...] Through ZDERA Section 4C, the Secretary of the Treasury is ordered to direct US Directors at the International Financial Institutions listed in Section 3, [...] "to oppose and vote against-- (1) any extension by the respective institution of any loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or (2) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any international financial institution." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden {{was also}} a long-time member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1997, he became the ranking {{minority}} member and chaired the committee in January 2001 and from June 2001 through 2003. When Democrats re-took control of the Senate following the 2006 elections, Biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in 2007. [...] Biden was generally a liberal internationalist in foreign policy. [...] He collaborated effectively with important Republican Senate figures such as Richard Lugar and <b>Jesse</b> <b>Helms</b> and sometimes went against elements of his own party. [...] Biden was also co-chairman of the NATO Observer Group in the Senate. [...] A partial list covering this time showed Biden meeting with some 150 leaders from nearly 60 countries and international organizations. [...] Biden held frequent hearings {{as chairman of the}} committee, as well as holding many subcommittee hearings during the three times he chaired the Subcommittee on European Affairs.|$|E
