5|$|The {{combination}} of wind shear and low-level helicity produced moderate convection across central Florida {{in association with}} the precursor low pressure system. Late on September20, a supercell developed near Lake Apopka, and tracking quickly northward it spawned an EF1 tornado near Eustis; the tornado tracked for 1.83mi (2.94km) and reached winds of about 100mph (160km/h). The tornado destroyed 20homes, left 30others severely damaged, injured one person, and caused power outages for about 300people. Damage totaled $6.2million (2007USD).

5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town.

In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir {{played an important role in}} defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area.

5|$|In the Philippines, Imbudo was {{the strongest}} typhoon in five years, causing {{widespread}} flooding and power outages in the Cagayan Valley for weeks. Damage was heaviest in Isabela province near where the storm struck. Most of the banana crop was destroyed, and other crops sustained similar but lesser damage. Imbudo disrupted transportation across much of Luzon. Nationwide, the storm damaged or destroyed 62,314houses, causing P4.7billion (PHP, $86million USD) in damage, mostly in the Cagayan Valley. There were also 64deaths in the country. In Hong Kong, strong winds <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> after knocking him off a platform. In China, damage was heaviest in Guangdong where the storm struck. Thousands of trees fell, and 595,000houses were wrecked. Hundreds of canceled flights stranded travelers across the region.

He was a representative to the state constitutional convention of 1799, but his promising political career was almost derailed when he <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in a duel stemming from a drunken dispute during a game of cards.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas.

A fallen tree <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina.

High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels. Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed. Storm debris injured several people, and a steel window frame struck and <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person.

In Bermuda, sustained winds of 91mph (146km/h) and gusts up to 117mph (188km/h) downed trees and power lines, cutting power to approximately 28,000 residents. Rainfall was largely insignificant, peaking at 3.19in (81mm). Impacts near the storm's landfall in Newfoundland were more severe. Rainfall amounts of more than 2in (50mm) were widespread, with a peak of 9.37in (238mm) in St Lawrence; as such, Igor ranks as the third wettest tropical cyclone to impact Atlantic Canada. Run-off from the torrential rainfall damaged or destroyed structures, <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> when his driveway was washed out and he was swept away, and isolated approximately 150 communities.

5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a building that was supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Shawn.
