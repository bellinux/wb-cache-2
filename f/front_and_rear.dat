5|$|Introduced a new {{six-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} and revised styling. The powerplant {{remained the same}} as before. Exterior changes included restyled <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> fascias, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> wheels.|$|E
5|$|In flight, {{the white}} {{lining of the}} underwings {{can be seen in}} {{contrast}} to the blackish underbody and upperside. The purple speculum lacks white bands at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear,</b> and rarely has a white trailing edge. A dark crescent is visible on the median underwing primary coverts.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} no longer used for worship by the Church in Wales and, as of July 2012, it was being offered for sale at £65,000. Some of the {{surrounding}} land {{is included in the}} sale, but the graveyards to the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> of the church are not.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept car}} had a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} produced by Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated electrically adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> {{wheels are}} {{different}} sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle}} of repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a limited}} {{production}} car based on the GranTurismo MC Concept, but included 6-points seat-belt, 120 L fuel tank, 380 mm <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 326 mm <b>rear</b> brake disc with 6-piston <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 4-piston <b>rear</b> calipers, 11x18-in wheels with 305/645/18 <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 305/680/18 <b>rear</b> tires, carbon fiber shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The chassis with MacPherson strut <b>front</b> <b>and</b> {{multilink}} <b>rear</b> suspension {{was common}} to all S13 and RS13 models. The European 200SX initially had 257mm <b>front</b> brakes <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> disc service brakes with drum parking brakes in the rotor hubs. Later models had larger 280mm front brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Z07 {{performance}} {{package includes}} Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 P285/30ZR19 <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 335/25ZR20 <b>rear</b> tires, 394x36mm <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 388x33mm <b>rear</b> carbon ceramic-matrix brake discs, a larger winglets {{to the front}} splitter, more pronounced side skirts, and an adjustable see-through center section on the rear spoiler.|$|R
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> left legs are {{in contact with the}} ground and move the insect forward, while the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
50|$|PAS {{also made}} other {{performance}} changes, {{which included the}} 1LE brake package originally engineered for Trans Am racecars. The setup featured vented 12-inch <b>front</b> <b>and</b> 11.7-inch <b>rear</b> rotors to ensure fade-free performance. The aluminum dual-piston <b>front</b> <b>and</b> single-piston <b>rear</b> calipers were borrowed from the Chevrolet Corvette.|$|R

5|$|The {{globular}} cluster Palomar 5, for example, {{is near the}} apogalactic point of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams of stars extend outward toward the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching out to distances of 13,000 light-years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way halo.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot and}} gunner/radio {{operator}} sat in tandem, {{back to back}} in a single pressurized cockpit, protected by armour plates to their <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear,</b> {{as well as by}} a bulletproof windscreen, seated on ejection seats. The aircraft was intended to use Klimov VK-1 engines, a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene II, but the engine was still under development, so less powerful Kuznetsov RD-45s were substituted instead. The aircraft carried a Toryii-1 radar for use by the gunner/radio operator.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E
5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two {{of which have been}} designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E

5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{crafted a}} simple battle {{plan for the}} {{expected}} engagement. His ships would steam in column with his destroyers at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> of his cruiser column, searching across a 300 degree arc with SG surface radar {{in an effort to}} gain positional advantage on the approaching enemy force. The destroyers were to illuminate any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser's float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and illuminate the Japanese warships with flares. Although Helena and Boise carried the new, greatly improved SG radar, Scott chose San Francisco as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
