5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|Openings {{are also}} {{classified}} as Static Rook openings, where the offense {{is supported by}} the rook in its original position, and Ranging Rook openings, where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful piece on the board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> keep the king well away from the rook. Relatedly, the static vs ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions tend to have castles {{on the left side of}} the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side.|$|E
500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking {{in the way the}} two-level account requires—to simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E
2500|$|During the winter, travel {{along the}} {{roads in the}} basin can become {{difficult}} to impossible depending on snow accumulation, particularly on the more remote gravel roads that are not regularly plowed. If road conditions or car trouble strand a motorist in the more remote areas of the basin, during the pulses of intense winter cold common to this area, {{there is a real}} risk of death or injury by freezing. The Tongue River basin does not have the [...] "gumbo" [...] type mud that affects road travel in wet weather {{on the north side of}} the Yellowstone River. Traffic on the gravel and dirt roads of the Tongue River basin is a problem at sharp corners, blind hilltops, concealed entrances to side roads, and when suddenly encountering oversized slow ranch/farm vehicles. In warm weather it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> keep an eye out ahead for dust clouds indicating approaching vehicles. The motorist traveling in the Tongue River basin should keep a constant look out for livestock on the road, and especially for deer (particularly at dawn, dusk and at night).|$|E

2500|$|Mice {{are kept}} as pets in many {{countries}} {{for a number of}} reasons: Fancy mice are relatively small, inexpensive, never need bathing, and can learn to enjoy regular handling. Female mice are popular with many owners since they tend to co-habitate with other mice better than males. Additionally, the urine of female fancy mice does not contain as strong an odor as that of the male mice. Bucks will often fight with and kill each other when housed together, despite being raised together, due to their very strong and unchangeable territorial instincts. It is difficult to house male mice together without the risk of injury to one or both males. [...] Some people, however, prefer the personality and curiosity of male mice. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> keep fancy mice in groups of at least two if possible, as mice are sociable animals. However, if a buck and a doe of breeding age are put in the same cage it is possible for them to reproduce at a maximum frequency of once every three weeks. Litters of 5-18 are not unusual.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} view among guidance advisors {{is that it}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> visit colleges, preferably when {{college is}} in session and not during a summer break, {{with a chance to}} meet an actual student {{in the form of a}} tour guide, and taking notes for reference later when applying. Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit. A benefit is seeing a school as it really is—not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website. Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: [...] "can I see myself here"? Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and try to meet with them briefly or sit in on one of their classes. Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask good questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper. He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly. A follow-up [...] "thank you" [...] note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There are differing {{recommendations}} {{about the}} importance of interviews, with the consensus view that interviews were overall less important than college admissions essays, but should be done if they were offered. One advisor suggested that visits by college admissions personnel to the high schools were a waste of time for colleges, since there was not enough time to get to know specific applicants. In addition, she felt that personal interviews were generally overrated, though she noted that many Ivies have alumni interviews, which can help in borderline situations. One counselor suggested that if an interview was offered by a college admissions program, then it was not really optional but it should be seen as a requirement, that is, not going to such an interview could be detrimental to a student's chances for admission. Another suggested that a student should try to get an interview, even if it was not required, since it might help [...] "exhibit character strengths" [...] that might not show up via grades on high school transcripts. Several reports noted that most Ivy League schools have abandoned the interview requirement, but that if there is an opportunity for an interview, even with an alumnus of the college, then it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> do it since not doing it signals a lack of interest in the school. Knowing a college can be helpful during an interview, so that an applicant can say something specific about the school, or a professor who teaches there, or a subject or internship opportunities, since it shows sincere interest. Interviews (if offered) may be more of a factor at small liberal arts colleges: ...|$|E

60|$|And {{there is}} doubtless a certain poetic unity and irony in {{gathering}} together {{three or four}} of the crudest and most cocksure of the modern theorists, with their shrill voices and metallic virtues, under the fulness and the sonorous sanity of Christian bells. But the figures satirised in The Chimes cross each other's path and spoil each other in some degree. The main purpose of the book was a protest against that impudent and hard-hearted utilitarianism which arranges the people only in rows of men or even in rows of figures. It is a flaming denunciation of that strange mathematical morality which was twisted often unfairly out of Bentham and Mill: a morality by which each citizen must regard himself as a fraction, and a very vulgar fraction. Though the particular form of this insolent patronage has changed, this revolt and rebuke is still of value, and may be wholesome for those who are teaching the poor to be provident. Doubtless it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> be provident, in the sense that Providence is provident, but that should mean being kind, and certainly not merely being cold.|$|E
