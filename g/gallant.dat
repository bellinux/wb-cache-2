5|$|Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According to family legend, the grandchildren of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> turned from elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> have {{also appeared in}} contexts divorced from the comic. Philosopher Theodore Sider used the characters in an argument against {{the notion of a}} binary Heaven or Hell conception of the afterlife. Sider conceived of Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> as near-equals, with <b>Gallant</b> only marginally better than Goofus, in arguing that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is antithetical to God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> as archetypes of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic. It {{has been used in}} several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and <b>Gallant,</b> as archetypes of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Goofus and <b>Gallant</b> strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or <b>Gallant)</b> was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Gallant</b> (H59) was a G-class destroyer, {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent {{considerable}} time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. <b>Gallant</b> was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of World War II to the British Isles, to escort shipping in local waters. She was slightly damaged by German aircraft during the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk at the end of May 1940. Following repairs, <b>Gallant</b> was transferred to Gibraltar and served with Force H for several months. In November, the ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she escorted several convoys. She struck a mine in January 1941 and was towed to Malta for repairs. These were proved extensive and <b>Gallant</b> was further damaged by near-misses during an air raid in April 1942, before they were completed. The additional damage made the ship uneconomical to repair so she was scuttled as a blockship in 1943. Her wreck was broken up in 1953.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gallant</b> {{was laid}} down by Alexander Stephen and Sons in Glasgow, Scotland on 15 September 1934, {{launched}} on 26 September 1935 and completed on 25 February 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £252,920. She {{was assigned to the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. <b>Gallant</b> patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. She pulled off a Spanish merchantman that had grounded between Almeria and Málaga on 20 December 1936. The ship was attacked by a Spanish Nationalist aircraft off Cape San Antonio on 6 April 1937, but was not damaged.

5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My <b>Gallant</b> {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My <b>Gallant</b> was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of <b>Gallant</b> Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E
