5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects {{the prevalence of}} chronic HBV infection in a given area. In low prevalence {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate prevalence areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high <b>endemicity</b> such as Africa, transmission during childhood is a significant factor. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high <b>endemicity</b> is at least 8% with 10–15% prevalence in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively. According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600,000 people die every year related to the infection.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low <b>endemicity)</b> and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{presently}} endemic {{in a broad}} band around the equator, {{in areas of the}} Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur. An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66). A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali. The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global endemic levels of malaria, providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden. This effort led to the publication of a map of P.falciparum <b>endemicity</b> in 2010. As of 2010, about 100 countries have endemic malaria. Every year, 125 million international travellers visit these countries, and more than 30,000 contract the disease.|$|E

40|$|Background Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{has been}} {{targeted by the}} World Health Organization (WHO) and five countries in the Indian subcontinent for elimination {{as a public health}} problem. To achieve this target, the WHO has developed guidelines consisting of four phases of different levels of control activities, based on vector control through indoor-residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) and active case detection (ACD). Mathematical transmission models of VL are increasingly used for planning and assessing the efficacy of interventions and evaluating the intensity and timescale required to achieve the elimination target. Methods This paper draws together the key policy-relevant recommendations from recent transmission modelling of VL, and presents new predictions for VL incidence under the control interventions recommended by the WHO using the latest transmission models. Results The model predictions suggest that the current WHO guidelines should be sufficient to reach the elimination target in areas that had medium VL <b>endemicities</b> (up to 5 VL cases per 10, 000 population per year) {{prior to the start of}} interventions. However, additional interventions, such as extending the WHO attack phase (intensive IRS and ACD), may be required to bring forward elimination in regions with high pre-control <b>endemicities,</b> depending on the relative infectiousness of different disease stages. Conclusions The potential hurdle that asymptomatics, and in particular post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis cases (PKDL), may pose to reaching and sustaining the target needs to be addressed. As VL incidence decreases, the pool of immunologically naive individuals increases, which creates the potential for new large-scale outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Malaria in the {{highlands}} of Kenya is traditionally regarded as unstable and limited by low temperature. Brief warm periods may facilitate malaria transmission and are therefore able to generate epidemic conditions in immunologically naive human populations living at high altitudes.

40|$|Background: Malaria is {{a serious}} public health problem in Indonesia, {{particularly}} in areas outside Java and Bali. The spread {{of resistance to the}} currently available anti-malarial drugs or insecticides used for mosquito control would cause an increase in malaria transmission. To better understand patterns of transmission and resistance in Indonesia, an integrated mosquito survey was conducted in three areas with different malaria <b>endemicities,</b> Purworejo in Central Java, South Lampung District in Sumatera and South Halmahera District in North Mollucca. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected from the three areas through indoor and outdoor human landing catches (HLC) and indoor restinging catches.

We studied levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG subclasses with specificity for VSAPAM and for non-PAM type VSA in pregnant and nonpregnant women from two sites with different <b>endemicities</b> in Cameroon. We found that VSAPAM-specific responses depended on the pregnancy status, parity, gestational age, and parasite transmission intensity, whereas only the parasite transmission intensity influenced the levels of IgG specific for non-PAM type VSA.

40|$|Artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy is exerting novel selective pressure upon populations of Plasmodium falciparum across Africa. Levels {{of resistance to}} non-artemisinin partner drugs differ among parasite populations, and so the artemisinins are not uniformly protected from developing resistance, already present in South East Asia. Here, we consider strategies for prolonging the period of high level efficacy of {{combination therapy}} for two particular <b>endemicities</b> common in Africa. Under high intensity transmission, two alternating first-line combinations, ideally with antagonistic selective effects on the parasite genome, are advocated for paediatric malaria cases. This leaves second-line and other therapies for adult cases, and for intermittent preventive therapy. The drug portfolio would be selected to protect the 'premier' combination regimen from selection for resistance, while maximising impact on severe disease and mortality in children. In endemic areas subject to low, seasonal transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, such a strategy may deliver little benefit, as children represent a minority of cases. Nevertheless, the deployment of other drug-based interventions in low transmission and highly seasonal areas, such as mass drug administration aimed to interrupt malaria transmission, or intermittent preventive therapy, does {{provide an opportunity to}} diversify drug pressure. We thus propose an integrated approach to drug deployment, which minimises direct selective pressure on parasite populations from any one drug component.

We simulated these interventions using programmatic information on the frequency and coverage of mass treatments and trained the model projections using longitudinal parasitological data from 27 communities, evaluating the projected outcome of elimination (local parasite extinction) or resurgence. We found that EPIONCHO and ONCHOSIM captured adequately the epidemiological trends during mass treatment but that resurgence, while never predicted by ONCHOSIM, was predicted by EPIONCHO in some communities with the highest (inferred) vector biting rates and associated pre-intervention <b>endemicities.</b> Resurgence can be extremely protracted such that low (microfilarial) prevalence between 1 % and 5 % can be maintained for 3 – 5 years before manifesting more prominently.

40|$|Abstract Background Fever has {{traditionally}} {{served as the}} entry point for presumptive treatment of malaria in African children. However, recent changes in the epidemiology of malaria across many places in Africa {{would suggest that the}} predictive accuracy of a fever history as a marker of disease has changed prompting calls for the change to diagnosis-based treatment strategies. Methods Using data from six national malaria indicator surveys undertaken between 2007 and 2009, the relationship between childhood (6 - 59 months) reported fever on the day of survey and the likelihood of coincidental Plasmodium falciparum infection recorded using a rapid diagnostic test was evaluated across a range of <b>endemicities</b> characteristic of Africa today. Results Of 16, 903 children surveyed, 3 % were febrile and infected, 9 % were febrile without infection, 12 % were infected but were not febrile and 76 % were uninfected and not febrile. Children with fever {{on the day of the}} survey had a 1. 98 times greater chance of being infected with P. falciparum compared to children without a history of fever on the day of the survey after adjusting for age and location (OR 1. 98; 95 % CI 1. 74 - 2. 34). There was a strong linear relationship between the percentage of febrile children with infection and infection prevalence (R 2 = 0. 9147). The prevalence of infection in reported fevers was consistently greater than would be expected solely by chance and this increased with increasing transmission intensity. The data suggest that in areas where community-based infection prevalence in childhood is above 34 - 37 %, 50 % or more of fevers are likely to be associated with infection. Conclusion The potential benefits of diagnosis will depend on the prevalence of infection among children who report fever. The study has demonstrated a predictable relationship between parasite prevalence in the community and risks of infection among febrile children suggesting that current maps of parasite prevalence could be used to guide diagnostic strategies in Africa. </p...|$|R

40|$|Malaria had being widely {{prevalent}} for a {{long time}} in Iran. Before starting any anti-malarial campaign in Iran about 60 % of population was living in malaria endemic areas. In hyper-endemic areas, approximately 30 to 40 % of the total mortality was due to malaria. The malariometric data, reported during 1921 - 1949 in the malaria surveys in some endemic areas, showed high <b>endemicities</b> of the disease in most parts of the country. The first malaria-training course for preliminary operations of anti-malaria campaign was started in Iran in 1945. Afterwards, in the courses conducted, mostly by the Institute of Malariology many technical personnel were trained. In 1947, for the first time DDT was used in mosquito control in a pilot study in malaria hyper-endemic villages near Tehran. It caused great reduction in malaria transmission. Anti-malarial campaign including drug prophylaxis and treatment, anti-mosquito spraying with DDT and some anti-larval control measures, carried out during 1948 - 1956, considerably decreased malaria infection rate in most endemic areas. In 1957, malaria eradication programme (MEP) started in Iran and up to 1980 almost interrupted malaria transmission in the north parts of the country. However, in the south parts although the infection rate considerably decreased, but due to some technical and operational problems, malaria transmission was not interrupted. Therefore, in 1980 the MEP shifted to malaria control programme (MCP) which has been continuing up to present time. From 25 species of Anopheles found in Iran, 8 species of A. stephensi, A. fluviatilis, A. culicifacies, A. pulcherimus, A. d’thali, A. superpictus, A. sacharovi and A. maculipennis are considered to be malaria vectors. The prevalent species of Plasmodia in Iran are P. falciparum and P. vivax. P. malariae is rare. The main problems, in the malaria endemic areas of the southeast parts of Iran are resistance of the main vectors to some insecticides as well as high resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine. The total reported malaria cases in Iran from 96340 with 45 % P. falciparum in 1991, gradually, decreased to 18966 with 12 % P. falciparum in 2005. About 30 to 50 % of malaria patients have been among foreign immigrants...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, {{individuals}} are frequently asymptomatic {{and may be}} undetected by conventional microscopy or newer, rapid diagnostic tests. Molecular techniques allow a more accurate assessment of this asymptomatic parasite burden, the extent of which is important for malaria control. This study examines the relative prevalence of sub-microscopic level parasite carriage and clonal complexity of infections (multiplicity of infection) over a range of <b>endemicities</b> in a region of north-eastern Tanzania where altitude is an established proxy of malaria transmission. The PCR prevalence was then compared against other measures of transmission intensity collected in the same area. METHODS: This study used 1, 121 blood samples collected from a previously conducted cross-sectional malario-metric survey during the short rainy season in 2001 from 13 villages (three at 1, 200 m in altitude above sea level). Samples were analysed by PCR for carriage of parasites and multiplicity of infection. These data were compared with other measures of transmission intensity collected from the same area. RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was 34. 7 % by PCR and 13. 6 % by microscopy; a 2. 5 -fold difference in line with other recent observations. This fold difference was relatively consistent at the different altitude bands despite a marked decrease in parasite prevalence with altitude: 1, 200 m 15. 8 vs 5. 9. The difference between parasite prevalence by PCR was 3. 2 in individuals aged between 15 and 45 years (34. 5 vs 10. 9) compared with 2. 5 in those aged 1 - 5 (34. 0 vs 13. 5) though this was not statistically significant. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 7 and was positively associated with parasite prevalence assessed by both PCR and microscopy. There was no association of MOI and age. Village level PCR parasite prevalence was strongly correlated with altitude, sero-conversion rate and predicted entomological inoculation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic, low density, multi-clone malaria infection was common in this study area. These infections are important as potential contributors to the infectious reservoir of parasites {{and need to be}} identified by control programmes especially in this era where malaria elimination is a focus. High throughput standardized PCR approaches are needed to identify individuals who are malaria carriers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) greatly affects {{livestock}} production in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana prevalence of AAT {{is estimated to}} range between 5 and 50 %. Studies have reported serum biochemical aberrations and variability in cytokine profiles in animals during infection. However, information regarding the biochemical parameters and cytokine profiles associated with natural infections are limited. This study was therefore aimed at investigating changes in the levels of serum biochemical parameters and inflammatory cytokines during a natural infection. Methods Nested internal transcribed spacer (ITS) -based PCR and sequencing were used to characterise trypanosome infection in cattle at two areas in Ghana (Adidome and Accra) of different <b>endemicities.</b> The cattle were sampled at four to five-week intervals {{over a period of}} six months. Levels of serum biochemical parameters, including creatinine, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin and total protein and cytokines (interleukin 10, interleukin 4, interleukin 12, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured in serum samples and then compared between infected cattle and uninfected controls. Results The predominant trypanosome species detected in Accra (non-endemic) and Adidome (endemic) were Trypanosoma theileri and Trypanosoma vivax, respectively. Serum biochemical parameters were similar between infected and uninfected cattle in Accra. Infected cattle at Adidome however, had significantly higher levels of ALP, creatinine, total protein and total bilirubin (P <  0. 05) and significantly lower levels of cholesterol (P <  0. 05) at specific time points. At basal levels and during infection, significantly higher pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory (Th 1 /Th 2) cytokine ratios were observed in cattle at Adidome compared to Accra (P <  0. 05), indicating a shift towards Th 1 immune response in Adidome. Levels of IL- 10 were, however, significantly elevated in infected cattle in Accra (P <  0. 05), suggesting high anti-inflammatory cytokine response in Accra. Conclusion These results suggests that cattle in an endemic area repeatedly infected with trypanosomes of different species or different antigenic types demonstrate high pro-inflammatory (Th 1) immune response and biochemical alterations whereas cattle in a non-endemic area with predominantly chronic T. theileri infections demonstrate high anti-inflammatory response and no biochemical alterations...|$|R
