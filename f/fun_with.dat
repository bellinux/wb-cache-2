5|$|Having <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage is a 1974 {{spoken word}} concert album by American singer and {{musician}} Elvis Presley. The album consists entirely of byplay and banter by Presley from between songs during a live concert—primarily jokes, with the songs themselves {{removed from the}} recording.|$|E
5|$|Presley himself {{disapproved of}} the album, {{and it was}} later {{withdrawn}} at his request. Despite this, Having <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage reached number 130 on the Billboard 200, peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot Country LPs, and spawned bootleg copies along with a fan-made sequel.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album through his own label, Boxcar Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was {{theoretically}} able to retain the profits from the album. Having <b>Fun</b> <b>with</b> Elvis on Stage was first distributed at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E

5|$|The group {{remembered the}} {{recording}} being a happy process, {{with a strong}} feeling of camaraderie and <b>fun,</b> <b>with</b> numerous practical jokes. They were fans of Python, and this style of humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band coming up with various ideas for the music. Some parts were recorded in a single take with every member having an input, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and {{endeavours}} {{of the title}} character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, Squidward and SpongeBob are forced to work 24 hours a day by Mr. Krabs, {{so that he can}} get more money. Squidward soon gets bored, and tells SpongeBob a scary story to have some <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> him. After scaring SpongeBob, Squidward tells him that the story is fictional. However, when Squidward and SpongeBob are alone, the events in Squidward's story begin to occur.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game <b>fun,</b> <b>with</b> challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E

25|$|In 2010–2011, Bryan Erickson {{teamed up}} with William Anderson of Louisiana. William did a ton of sampling, Bryan made a bunch of VAC B-sides and turned them into Toxic Coma tracks. The project is very old with a {{revolving}} door of members, again Bryan being the main constant. This LP fuses the techno sound of <b>Fun</b> <b>With</b> Knives and the brutal black humor of Toxic Coma. This VAC side project is known as Toxic Coma Satan Rising, on Metropolis Records. Erickson then began to write more music for future VAC LPs.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

25|$|Saidy {{was born}} in Bakau, western Gambia, and raised by his mother. His first {{experience}} in the sprint events came {{in high school in}} his hometown. He reportedly took up the 200 metres event in order to avoid beating his friend, who already had taken up the 100 metres event. In June 2001 Saidy entered the West African Championships in Lagos, and won the 200 metres in 21.27. The result was a new Gambian record time. However, setting a national record did not inspire him to commence serious training, as he still preferred to play basketball and volleyball for <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> his schoolmates.|$|E
