25|$|Intramuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue {{has been used}} in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as hypertonic saline is that IMES can be turned on and off. This allows the researcher to exert a much higher degree of control and precision in terms of the stimulus and the measurement of the response. The method is easier to carry out than the injection method as it does not require special training in how it should be used. The frequency of the <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> can also be controlled. For most studies a frequency of about 10Hz is needed to stimulate both local and referred pain.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 paper {{demonstrated}} that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees Celsius, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, {{a necessary condition}} for net power. The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas. An <b>electrical</b> <b>pulse</b> is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic-field-entrapped plasma is called a plasmoid. The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the plasmoid to fusion temperatures.|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on the phase and {{microstructure}} development in the Ti 33 Cu 67 alloy ribbons brought to successive stages of crystallization by high-density <b>electrical</b> <b>pulsing.</b> We apply a pulsed electrical current of high current density (of the order of 108 to 109 A m- 2) to thin ribbons of the amorphous alloy Ti 33 Cu 67 and analyze the effects of the electrical current parameters on the phase composition and microstructure of the crystallized alloy. The estimated heating rates during the <b>electrical</b> <b>pulses</b> in this work are of the order of 106 to 107 K s- 1. So, <b>electrical</b> <b>pulsing</b> can create heating rates comparable to quenching rates used during the preparation of amorphous alloys. <b>Electrical</b> <b>pulsing</b> of high current densities and short pulse durations creates conditions of rapid heating and cooling. A sample experiencing high-density currents can fracture, fully degrade, or explode. Using extremely short pulses, certain crystallization stages can be quenched in the samples and metastable products/microstructures can be obtained. Hence, <b>electrical</b> <b>pulsing</b> makes it possible to study physical and chemical phenomena under strongly non-equilibrium conditions during heating and cooling. Even under high current densities, it is still possible to keep the sample's shape inducing partial crystallization (nanocrystallization) of the amorphous alloy.|$|R
