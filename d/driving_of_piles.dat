40|$|ABSTRACT: Impact <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> is {{a complex}} process which depends on the {{interaction}} of the stress wave progressing down the pile and on the dynamic soil resistance along the shaft and at the toe. Pile driving vibrations can adversely affect adjacent structures, and the intensity of ground vibrations depends on the dynamic resistance along the pile rather than on the energy applied to the pile. The viscous damping factor, Jc, is one of the fundamental parameters when the static pile resistance is determined from dynamic tests. Theoretical analyses and field observations show that the Jc-factor is not solely a soil parameter, but a function of the ratio of pile impedance and soil impedance at the pile toe. Consequently, the pile toe damping factor for an open-toe pipe pile would be different when no plug develops in the pile and when the pile toe is fully plugged. Moreover, the mentioned aspect needs to be considered when the results of a test pile of one pile type are applied to a construction pile of a different type. Viscous damping along the pile shaft and at the pile toe is the source of ground vibrations. The vibration magnitude is governed by the interactive nature of dynamic pile-soil resistance, which {{is a function of the}} ratio between the pile impedance and the soil impedance for P-waves. It is shown that the vibration transmission efficacy and the dynamic resistance are inversely linearly proportional to the pile impedance, and that energy transmission efficacy correctly reflects the vibration emission from the pile t...|$|E
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the causes for the driving difficulties often given experienced on highway projects where thin shells are used for cast-in situ concrete piles that support bridge approaches, and to develop a set of recommendations and procedures to enable INDOT engineers to (a) make use of available technology for dynamic analysis of pile driving; and (b) make appropriate changes in the design, construction and contract specification procedures to improve identification and correction of problems at the earliest possible stage. This study indicates that the parameter of greatest importance for most projects is the hammer and driving train used in the piling operations. Hence, it is suggested that INDOT Geotechnical engineers provide specifications based on detailed analysis of the anticipated effect of various hammer sizes. This analysis is done using the wave equation analysis program, WEAP 87, available with the INDOT, as opposed to the usual design procedure where the 2 ̆ 7 set 2 ̆ 7 is obtained using energy formulae which are generally inaccurate and do not predict driving resistance. The results of the analysis can be summarized with a family of curves - usable in the field. Development of these charts and plots for various parameters is explained in the report with detailed examples and case studies. The suggestions contained in the study can be implemented by the INDOT and would result in savings, both in terms of mitigating damage to the shells, and reducing the time spent on <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>piles...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the driving behavior and load-settlement characteristics of vibratory driven piles. To achieve this goal, a finite difference program, FLAC, was employed to simulate the pile-hammer-soil system. The soil was modeled using a hyperbolic stress-strain relationship with isotropic hardening and Rayleigh damping. Geometric damping in the soil was accounted for through the mesh and the absorbing boundaries. A parametric study was carried out to examine the driving process and post driving load-deformation behavior. The important factors that influence the response of vibratory driven piles, such as initial soil conditions, hammer characteristics, soil model, pile properties, and installation characteristics were investigated. This study focused on vibratory driving in drained sands because vibratory <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> is usually more efficient than impact driving in sands. The major factors influencing vibratory driving {{were found to be}} the pile/soil interface friction and initial lateral earth pressure for non-displacement piles. For vibratory driving of displacement piles, depth of pile embedment and the soil model used were most important. An initial objective {{of the study was to}} use a model based on the concepts of critical state soil mechanics and that could account for the dilative and contractive behavior of soils under vibratory loading conditions. However, this approach was not successful due to the inability to develop a method to dependably sense stress reversal within the inherent 2 ̆ 2 noise 2 ̆ 2 of the explicit solution scheme. The model was employed successfully to investigate the load/displacement characteristics of piles after installation. Soil arching, and soil modulus were found to have large influence on the bearing capacity of piles. The estimated bearing capacities were compared with values obtained from published empirical formulas for vibratory driven piles. ...|$|E

40|$|BAMA Gruppen AS have {{constructed}} a new 44 000 m 2 warehouse, office and distribution centre in Groruddalen in northern parts of Oslo, Norway. Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) were employed as geotechnical consultants, contributing to evaluation of different foundation methods, design <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> foundations {{in cooperation with}} structural engineers and installation <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> {{in cooperation with the}} piling contractor. Within the perimeter of the warehouse, the depth to bedrock is between 30 to 50 meters. The typical soil profile is about 2 m of various fill material over 5 to 10 meters of stiff to very stiff clay over a slightly overconsolidated quick clay. Because of the extent <b>of</b> <b>piling,</b> concrete piles were very cost effective for the client. The stiff clay layer however could in theory lead to damaging tension stresses in the concrete piles during driving. For concrete piles up to 50 m length, the total number of blows is also considerable. NGI performed pile-driving simulations, and the contractor performed test-driving at the site. During test-driving, PDA equipment was mounted, monitoring <b>pile</b> stresses during <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> the whole <b>pile</b> length. Test-driving was successful, and pile stresses observed within acceptable limits. During the early phases <b>of</b> production <b>driving,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> broken during <b>driving</b> was higher than expected.

The impact compression behaviors of about 4700 high-capacity H-piles that were 14 - 80 m long at final set were studied. Measured data revealed that maximum impact forces are very scattered, but their means are independent of the hammer type, ram weight, ram drop, impact velocity, and pile length. Maximum impact compression <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> and affected pile length exist in both long and short piles.

It was found that geotechnical engineers rely on static unit soil resistance equations that were developed over twenty years ago and that have a relatively large degree of empiricism. Updated and improved static design equations recently proposed in the literature {{have not yet been}} implemented in practice. Pile design relies predominantly on SPT data; cone penetration testing is performed only occasionally. Dynamic analysis <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> in standard practice is performed using Smith-type soil reaction models. A comprehensive review of existing soil reaction models for 1 -dimensional dynamic pile analysis is presented. This review allowed an assessment of the validity of existing models and identification of their limitations. New shaft and base reaction models are developed that overcome shortcomings of existing models and that are consistent with the physics and mechanics <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> <b>driving.</b> The proposed shaft reaction model consists of a soil disk representing the near field soil surrounding the pile shaft, a plastic slider-viscous dashpot system representing the thin shear band forming at the soil-pile interface located at the inner boundary of the soil disk, and far field- consistent boundaries placed at the outer boundary of the soil disk. The soil in the disk is assumed to follow a hyperbolic stress-strain law. The base reaction model consists of a nonlinear spring and a radiation dashpot connected in parallel. The nonlinear spring is formulated in a way that reproduces realistically the base load-settlement response under static conditions. The initial spring stiffness and the radiation dashpot take into account the effect of the high base embedment. Both shaft and base reaction models capture effectively soil nonlinearity, hysteretic damping, viscous damping, and radiation damping. The input parameters of the models consist of standard geotechnical parameters, thus reducing the level of empiricism in calculations to a minimum.

The {{objective of this}} research was to model the ground waves generated by pile driving using the ABAQUS finite element program in order to predict the free ground surface response resulting from installation by both impact and vibratory hammers. New procedures including infinite element and quiet boundary formulations have been developed for the computation of ground surface vibrations caused by impact and vibratory <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> pre-formed <b>piles.</b> The procedures do not require a detailed knowledge of site conditions and are therefore particularly useful as a preliminary design tool and for modelling the large amount of site data that currently exists in order to assist in the development of more rational guidance. The work has brought together research from several areas of study in order to produce computational procedures for modelling vibrations from pile driving. The new models have been validated by comparisons with measurements from various piling sites. The new methods now need to be applied to a large number of varied sites in order to develop site specific guidance. It is envisaged that this guidance could be in the form of design charts or simple formulae for incorporation into the relevant British Standards or Eurocodes. A range of common building forms has been incorporated into the models. The results indicate that slender frames can be analysed by transient displacements imposed on the foundations; however, a full three-dimensional analysis with soil-structure interaction is required for walls and infilled panels so that the reduced foundation displacements are modelled correctly. The techniques developed during this project could be usefully extended to model the effects <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> on various geotechnical structures and pipelines and also other forms of excitation, such as vibrocompaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the skin friction of onshore or offshore piles in sand is still a difficult problem for geotechnical engineers. It has been accepted by many researchers that the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> <b>piles</b> in the soil has shared some similarities with that of an element shear test under the constant normal stiffness (CNS) condition. This paper describes the behaviour of an element of soil next to a pile during the process <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> penetration into dense fine sand using the 2 D-DEM numerical simulation software. A new CNS servo {{was added to the}} horizontal boundary while maintaining the vertical stress constant. This should simulate the soil in a similar manner to that of a CNS pile-soil interface shear test, but allowing the vertical stress to remain constant which is more realistic to the field situation. Shear behaviours observed in these simulations were very similar to the results from previous researchers’ lab shearing tests. With the normal stress and shear stress obtained from the virtual models, the friction angle and the shaft friction factor β mentioned in the API- 2007 offshore pile design guideline were calculated and compared with the API recommended values...|$|R
60|$|Walter {{had made}} the best {{preparation}} possible for the defence. In the courtyard behind the breach his men had since morning been <b>driving</b> a circle <b>of</b> <b>piles,</b> connected by planks fastened to them. These were some five feet high, and along the top and in the face next to the breach sharp-pointed spikes and nails had been driven, rendering it difficult in the extreme for anyone to climb over. As the column of the assailants approached Walter placed his archers on the walls {{on either side of}} the breach, while he himself, with his men-at-arms, took his station in the gap and faced the coming host. The breach was some ten yards wide, but it was only for about half this width that the mound of broken stones rendered it possible for their enemies to assault, consequently there was but a space of some fifteen feet in width to be defended. Regardless of the flights of arrows, the French, headed by their knights and squires, advanced to the assault, and clambering up the rough stones attacked the defenders.|$|R
