Collaborative tagging systems allow users {{to use their own}} words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies.

40|$|Abstract—The {{capacity}} of rapidly disseminating {{information such as}} latest news headlines has made online social networks a popular and disruptive venue for spreading influence and distributing contents. Given the importance of online social networks, it becomes increasingly imperative to understand the shared <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> on the popular information or contents that circulate through these networks. This paper proposes a novel graphical approach based on bipartite graphs and one-mode projection graphs to model the interactions <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and information and to capture the shared <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> on the information. The experiments based on data-sets collected from Digg, a popular social news aggregation site, have demonstrated the proposed approach is able to discover inherent clusters <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and information within online social networks. The evaluation results also show that these clusters exhibit distinct characteristics. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to apply bipartite graphs and one-mode projections to shed light on the interactions of people and information in online social networks and to discover the clustered nature <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and contents.
