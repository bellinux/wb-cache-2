5|$|After {{weakening}} to {{a tropical}} depression on November23, Marco re-strengthened to {{a tropical storm}} on the following day. Marco tracked northwestward while fluctuating in intensity before finally weakening and dissipating on November26. Despite not making landfall, Marco produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, Hispaniola, Central America, and Jamaica, which caused significant flooding in some areas. In Honduras, 4,000homes were destroyed, 40bridges washed away, nearly 50,000acres of banana and <b>fruit</b> <b>plantations</b> flooded, and nine deaths were reported. Flooding also effected other Central American countries, albeit effects were less severe. Heavy rainfall was reported in Cuba, although flood damage is unknown. Marco contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica and caused three additional fatalities in the Dominican Republic. Overall, Marco caused 15fatalities and approximately $8.2million (1996USD) in damage.|$|E

Flood waters also inundated nearly 50,000acres of banana and <b>fruit</b> <b>plantations</b> owned by Chiquita Brands International. Other crops that sustained damage were maize, beans, sorghum, and rice. Agricultural losses associated with the storm totaled to approximately $7.7million. Along the Caribbean coastline of Honduras, about 1,000shanty houses were destroyed. Overall, Marco caused nine fatalities in the country. In the Pacific and northern regions of Nicaragua, numerous houses washed away in the floods. In addition, Nicaraguan civil defense authorities reported two fatalities. Further north in Guatemala, at least one death occurred, and flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. Swollen rivers in Costa Rica flooded several towns and numerous banana plantations.|$|E
25|$|Direct reuse projects. According to one estimate, 1,500 ha were {{irrigated}} with reclaimed {{water in}} the vicinity of treatment plants as of 2009 in 15 locations, of which the biggest are near As-Samra (510 ha), Aqaba (208 ha), Ramtha (121 ha) and Wadi Musa (107 ha). Crops irrigated are forage crops and tree crops. One of the first pilot projects for direct reuse was implemented in Wadi Musa with support from USAID. Water was first used to irrigate a demonstration farm, and then the fields of nearby farmers. Another pilot project was initiated using wastewater from the small Wadi Hassan treatment plant to irrigate green spaces {{on the campus of the}} University of Irbid, and commercial <b>fruit</b> <b>plantations.</b> In most cases of direct reuse, the Water Authority of Jordan, the operator of most municipal wastewater treatment plants in Jordan, has concluded contracts with farmers. The total area irrigated under contracts with WAJ is 760 ha, or about half the total irrigated area. It is thus about 12 times smaller than the area irrigated with indirectly reclaimed water from the As-Samra plant in the Jordan Valley.|$|E

500|$|A snake {{of forest}} or woodland, {{it is the}} only one of Africa's cobras that will live in high forest. The forest cobras are snakes that are well adapted to many environments and the habitat of the forest cobra is {{strongly}} dependent on what part of its African range the snake originates from. Forest cobras originating in the southern African regions are typically found in savanna and grassland, but they can also be found in broken rock country. They are mainly found in the tropical and subtropical rainforest regions of west and central Africa. It also inhabits mangroves in western Africa. The banded form of forest cobra in west Africa lives in savanna and grassland (but usually along streams) and well vegetated areas, especially riverine forest, up to latitude 14 N. The species' preferred habitat are lowland forest and moist savanna where it favours coastal thickets. This snake seems to be highly adaptable and will readily move into drier areas if it can. In western Kenya, the forest cobra has been found in wide stretched grassland areas. The population of forest cobras in Uganda are almost always found close to water. The brown colour phase occurs in coastal and high altitude forest, woodland and thicket, and grassland areas (i.e. Nyanga, Zimbabwe). Due to its secretive habits, and fondness for living in holes, it often persists in quite well-inhabited areas, common in and around many central African towns, even long after most vegetation has gone. They are also found on <b>fruit</b> <b>plantations</b> where they live in the trees. It occurs through a wide altitude range, from sea-level to forested mountains at [...] above sea-level.|$|E
