50|$|On 7 September 1949, Deutsche Bundesbahn {{was founded}} as the {{successor}} of Deutsche Reichsbahn {{in the territory}} of the Federal Republic of Germany. In October 1949, the wooden beams of the temporary bridge over the Danube River built in 1945 were replaced with steel beams. On 7 November 1950, the new Bundesbahn Hotel (called Bubaho by the people of the city) with 130 rooms was opened after a construction period of 18 months. In 1950, Ulm Hauptbahnhof sold 1.16 million tickets. On 6 April 1951, a radio system for controlling shunting was commissioned in Ulm station. On 21 March 1952, a Railroad Transportation Office was established for U.S. soldiers. In December 1952, the temporary sheds on the station were demolished so that construction of the new station building could begin. On 19 December 1953, Deutsche Bundesbahn employees moved into the new station building. In 1955, the <b>freight</b> <b>processing</b> and loading facilities were rebuilt. On 16 May 1955, the new general post office was completed in the station forecourt; its construction had begun on 6 October 1952 and it would be opened on 9 July 1955. Construction of the station pedestrian bridge, which had begun in 1954, was completed on the 5 August 1955. After the Hungarian Revolution was put down, the station handled trains carrying Hungarian refugees for several weeks from 30 November 1956. The construction of the railway bridge over the Danube, which had begun on 24 November 1955, was opened on 31 October 1957. The bridge over the Danube handled 160 trains per day at this time {{and was one of the}} busiest bridges in southern Germany.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{decision}} model {{designed to help}} policy-makers understand the disruptive impact of temporary closures of a container seaport on the supply chains that it supports. Such closures may have numerous possible causes, but security-related disruptions are of particular relevance today. Importantly, temporary closures result in highly variable product delivery leadtimes, increasing inventory management costs for supply chain operators. We develop a Markov decision model for the inventory management problem faced by a firm operating an international supply chain utilizing a seaport that may unexpectedly close. Since short port closures typically lead to ships waiting to offload containers, we use a simple deterministic queuing approach to model port <b>freight</b> <b>processing</b> dynamics. The model is {{used to determine the}} likely impact of both the probability of a seaport closure and also the expected closure duration on the optimal inventory management policy and its associated long-run average cost for a firm. The results of a numerical study indicate that the expected length of a seaport closure more negatively affects a firms supply chain productivity than the probability of closure, for example, causing increases in the expected daily holding and penalty costs of up to 136 %. Furthermore, firms that fail t...|$|E

40|$|East Midlands airport (EMA) is a {{regional}} airport in northwest Leicestershire in central England. It is located roughly equidistant {{between the three}} Midlands' cities of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham and currently supports a range of full-service scheduled, charter and low-cost passenger operations to short- and medium-haul destinations in Europe {{as well as a}} significant number of long-haul intra and intercontinental freight services. In 2012, EMA was the thirteenth busiest passenger airport in the UK, handling just over four million customers a year, and the country's largest pure <b>freight</b> facility, <b>processing</b> almost 300 000 t of cargo and mail. By examining the historical development and commercial evolution of EMA from its opening as a commercial airport in 1965 to the present day, the paper details how a combination of far-sighted planning decisions and strategic management interventions have enabled EMA to diversify its operations and develop a unique operating niche that serves passenger flights during the day and cargo operations at night.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{for managing the}} transfer process of the seaport is offered. The graph model {{of the system of}} transfer process management, in which all the likely routes of transportation of goods inside the port is designed. The graph-model includes a set of vertices that are loading and unloading points (piers, warehouses, railway station, etc.) and a set of arcs which is the direction (route) goods and vehicles movement. Functioning of the port cargo handling processes obeys Markov’s random processes. Therefore, the graph model of transfer processes is the state transition graph of the control system. Control system status is determined by freight stay in one of the vertices. Every transition from one vertex to another, indicating the movement of goods from one point to another, represents a change in the system. The problem to optimize the transfer process management is stated and the objective function for determining the routes of goods and vehicles movement in which the <b>freight</b> costs and <b>processing</b> of time vehicles will be minimal is defined...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{assumptions}} that world oil resources are finite and that world oil production will peak sometime in the 1980 s or 1990 s (Hughes & Mesarovic 1978 : 139). Such a scenario is now widely accepted and is robust to alternative assumptions on oil prices and reserves. Increases in the real world price of oil are therefore likely to occur. Because of New Zealand's almost complete dependence on imported oil for liquid fuel purposes and New Zealand's continuing balance of payments problems, the situation could become serious for New Zealand resulting in policies designed to reduce use of oil based fuels, such as substantial domestic fuel price increases, or government regulation of fuel use, such as rationing. This paper attempts to give an indication of the implications that an oil price rise could have for New Zealand agriculture. A large part of the paper is concerned with transport, since the transport industry is the largest user of liquid fuels in New Zealand. The paper concentrates on the effects of fuel price rises as opposed to physical rationing of liquid fuels. In describing the potential effects of fuel price rises, particular attention has been given to how farm costs and farm product prices may be affected by fuel price increases. Most attention is given to effects on and responses from the farm production sector of agriculture, although some consideration is also given to the agricultural <b>freight</b> and product <b>processing</b> sectors. Some brief comments are also made on the demand for transport in rural areas so that equitable fuel pricing or rationing systems can be devised and implemented if, and when, necessary...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{footprints}} {{show the}} carbon impacts of food products. They are argued here to reflect these impacts more accurately than 'food miles'. New Zealand {{research has shown}} that our major primary sectors are more efficient in terms of carbon dioxide emissions than their British equivalents over the farming and shipping stages of the lifecycle. However, little research has examined other stages, such as road and rail <b>freight</b> and meat <b>processing</b> within New Zealand. Furthermore, the agro-food sector only has partial knowledge about its greenhouse gas GHG) emissions from 'farm gate to plate' and is not yet fully prepared to implement GHG mitigation strategies. The aims of this study are to 1) calculate the carbon footprints of beef and lamb produced and consumed in New Zealand using a lifecycle approach (including all GHGs), and 2) evaluate, through key stakeholder interviews, the applicability of the carbon footprint concept to New Zealand for addressing consumer environmental concerns. The calculations show that the GHG footprints (all GHGs) of beef and lamb are comprised, for the most part, of on-farm methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Domestic and international freight contribute less than 5 % to these footprints, and data from a case study of two meat processing plants suggest that meat processing emissions contributes even less than freight emissions. When leaving aside on-farm methane and nitrous oxide emissions, meat <b>processing</b> and <b>freight</b> contribute less than half to the carbon dioxide (CO 2) footprints. Interviews conducted for this study show that key stakeholder attitudes to these issues are varied. Responses from government representatives centred on the need to support the agro-food sector in responding to foreign market demands; the response from industry was mixed but suggests that it is prepared to account for its GHG emissions, showing a preference for carbon footprints over food miles. Environmental NGOs warned that there are risks to New Zealand if it continues to rely on a 'clean green' image mostly due to its natural comparative advantage, and fails to account for its emissions...|$|R
