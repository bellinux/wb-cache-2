5|$|The German torpedo boats {{split into}} five groups, with each attacking a {{different}} {{section of the}} shipping in the channel. The German 5th Half-Flotilla sailed into the Dover Barrage and soon {{came into contact with}} five drifters of the 10th Drifter Division tending the anti-submarine nets and attacked. After hearing gunfire, Flirt—the drifters′ escort—approached the unidentified vessels and challenged them. The boats responded to the British signal with a similar signal. Confused, Flirts commander decided that the approaching vessels were Allied destroyers and that drifters had been attacked by a submarine. An open boat was also launched from <b>Flirt</b> to rescue survivors from the sinking drifters. The German boats attacked the destroyer, surprising the crew. Outnumbered, <b>Flirt</b> tried to ram one of the German boats; after a brief engagement it was sunk by gunfire and torpedoes. After sinking <b>Flirt,</b> the Germans continued the attack on the barrage, sinking two drifters each from the 8th and 16th Drifter Divisions. Six drifters were sunk and three others damaged, as well as the trawler H. E. Straud, before the Fifth Half-Flotilla withdrew.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flirting,</b> the {{attraction}} of the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations. It can involve body language, conversation, joking, or brief physical contact. <b>Flirting</b> is a socially acceptable way of attracting someone you may like. There are different types of <b>flirting,</b> and most people usually have one way of <b>flirting</b> that makes them most comfortable. When <b>flirting,</b> people can be polite, playful, physical, etc. Sometimes {{it is difficult to}} know whether or not the person you are <b>flirting</b> with is actually interested in you. <b>Flirting</b> styles vary according to culture. Different cultures have different social etiquette. For example, how long you can make eye contact with someone, or how closely you can stand by someone.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flirting</b> can {{be sexually}} suggestive, which can {{intentionally}} elicit a sexual response from another person. Research has identified different motivations {{for engaging in}} <b>flirting</b> behaviors. There is <b>flirting</b> with a sexual motivation, which is done {{with a view to}} engaging in Human sexual activity and there is also <b>flirting</b> with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part. An instrumental motivation of <b>flirting</b> behavior is <b>flirting</b> performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, <b>flirting</b> can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to sexual harassment in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship. In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of <b>flirting</b> as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female <b>flirting</b> as having a sexual motivation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flirting</b> {{with intent}} {{plays a role}} in the mate-selection process. The person <b>flirting</b> will send out signals of sexual {{availability}} to another, and expects to see the interest returned in order to continue <b>flirting.</b> <b>Flirting</b> can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, and hair-touching; or verbal signs, such as chatting, giving flattering comments, and exchanging telephone numbers in order to initiate further contact. In the 21st century <b>flirting</b> is increasingly taking place in instant messaging and other social media.|$|R

40|$|While {{there exists}} some {{research}} on offline <b>flirting,</b> {{there is currently}} {{little in the way}} of conceptual theory or empirical research on <b>flirting</b> in cyberspace. This paper attempts to help redress this balance. The paper initially presents a summary of the behaviour of offline <b>flirting</b> and particularly identifies what constitutes offline <b>flirting</b> signals. Given this background context, suggestions are made as to how we might better conceptualize online <b>flirting.</b> The prevailing wisdom has been that we should focus on the absence of the body in cyberspace. This view is challenged here. Instead, it is argued that researchers should re-orient their focus to how the body is reconstructed online. Winnicott's notions of `potential space' and `transitional objects' are drawn upon in this paper to advance an argument that online <b>flirting</b> should be considered as a form of play. In making this argument, it is contended that online <b>flirting</b> has unique aspects in comparison to offline <b>flirting.</b> In particular, while realistic elements are present in online <b>flirting,</b> there is a blurring between what is reality and fantasy when one engages in flirtatious behaviour on the Internet.

5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a <b>flirt.</b> The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E

5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a <b>flirt,</b> and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flirting</b> {{can be an}} {{expression}} of sexuality and a common form of social interaction whereby one person obliquely indicates a romantic and/or sexual interest towards another. However, <b>flirting</b> undertaken for amusement, with no intention of developing any further relationship, poses ethical dilemmas and sometimes faces disapproval from others, either {{because it can be}} misinterpreted as more serious, or it may be viewed as [...] "cheating" [...] if the person <b>flirting</b> is already in a romantic relationship with someone else; or if the person to whom <b>flirting</b> is directed is in an exclusive or a serious relationship. <b>Flirting</b> between individuals happens {{for a variety of reasons}} including the desire to interact sexually. Similarly, when an individual chooses not to engage in flirtation with another, it reflects the lack of sexual desire ...|$|R

5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler <b>FLIRT</b> units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} in Nozomu's character between the manga and anime.

Also, during the beauty pageant which he competed in with Kanata to see who was the best (Kanata didn't really care but Nozomu did) while taking pictures of Kanata to enter into the competition, in the anime he saw Kanata push Mikan and thought he was attacking her and sent it in to show everyone what a bad person he seemed to be. However, upon earning it was a misunderstanding, he bowed his head and apologized to Kanata, demonstrating he truly did not mean harm and wanted a fair competition. In contrast, the Nozomu in the manga is far more devious and low as he purposely altered the picture to make Kanata look bad, showing he didn't mind cheating to win.|$|R

Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal.
