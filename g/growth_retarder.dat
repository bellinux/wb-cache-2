40|$|The {{following}} grade Project is {{a resume}} {{of the main}} variables taken into account {{to the analysis of}} the female market of Guayaquil City and taking decisions supported by the interpretation of them for the introduction of a body hair <b>growth</b> <b>retarder</b> cream. It’s an intention to elaborate a product developed for reducing the frequency with which women resort to various methods to remove body hair, prolonging their effect and improving their results. Thus, to prolong the effects of waxing and other body hair elimination process the three major problems that are generated by those processes: the pain, time and money are attacked in a real way...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the effectiveness}} of crack <b>growth</b> <b>retarders</b> bonded to integral metallic structures. The study was performed by both numerical modelling and experimental tests. It focuses on aluminium alloy panels reinforced by bonded straps made of carbon-epoxy, glass-epoxy composite materials or a titanium alloy. The goal was to develop a fail-safe design for integrally stiffened skin-stringer panels applicable to aircraft wing structures. The modelling strategy and finite element models are presented and discussed. The requirements that the models should meet are also discussed. The study has focused on establishing the extent of crack retarder benefits, in terms of fatigue crack growth life improvement, by numerical simulation and experimental tests of various crack retarders. The results of predicted fatigue crack growth retardation have been validated by tests of laboratory samples. This study concludes that by bonding discrete straps to an integral structure, the fatigue crack growth life can be significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|Plant Protection Products (PPP) {{used in the}} {{horticulture}} {{industry can}} be both chemical and biological. They are used for weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides), and fungi (fungicides) and as <b>growth</b> <b>retarders.</b> Many horticulture workers {{get in touch with}} plants, treated with PPPs and many of these don’t use any protective equipment. The aim of this project is to illustrate the work environment hazards for staff working with greenhouse pot plants, after they have been sprayed. The method used was observations of the operations for packing plants. I studied the operations and took notes of how operations were performed and what protective equipment they used. I also took photos and asked questions. A literature study completed the observations. It was concentrated on possibilities to reduce the risks to be exposed to pesticide residues. Some of the risk factors noted were that without protective gloves, the workers got in direct contact with soil, flowers and leaves. Some persons wiped off their wet hands on the T-shirt and in some cases unprotected arms got in contact with leaves. Conclusions made are for instance the following: • A recommended protective equipment (gloves, sleeve protectors and apron) prevent a direct skin-contact to plants with possible residues. • It is hard to decide how big the hazards are and which effect it makes on humans. It depends on many factors as degradation rate, how much it has been sprayed, the toxicity of the PPP, what protective equipment you use, how much you get in contact with surfaces that are treated and how sensitive you are to different preparations. • If you use the recommended protective equipment combined with better knowledge about degradation time the risks are regarded to be rather low...|$|R
