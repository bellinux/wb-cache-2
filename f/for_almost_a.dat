5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> year due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> century. However, {{with the emergence}} of the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E

In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East, the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming the vanguard of the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain.|$|E

The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> decade.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

5|$|Beshear {{did little}} in the {{political}} arena <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H.

Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E

Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E
