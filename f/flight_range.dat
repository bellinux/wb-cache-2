5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the <b>flight</b> <b>range.</b> The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
25|$|The first Il-18, {{initially}} {{equipped with}} Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, flew on 4 July 1957. On 17 September 1958 the aircraft first flew {{with the new}} Ivchenko AI-20 engines. Vladimir Kokkinaki was the test pilot. Between 1958 and 1960 twenty-five world records were set by this aircraft, among them <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> and altitude records with various payloads. In 1958 the aircraft was awarded the Brussels World Fair Grand Prix. In April 1979 a monument was unveiled at Sheremetyevo airport to commemorate this remarkable aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} near water, not {{directly}} into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a stagnant pool. However, any open container containing water will suffice for larvae development, even {{with less than}} an ounce (30 ml) of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It {{is more likely to}} lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> (less than 200m), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the migratory behaviour of Grasshopper Warblers Locustella naevia {{on the south}} coast of Britain with respect to phenology, fuel loads, stopover behaviour and potential <b>flight</b> <b>ranges.</b> Data were derived from 5, 455 mist-net captures gathered over 10 years between July and October at the Pannel Valley Reserve, East Sussex. For the majority of captures and recaptures, fat score, wing length and body mass were recorded. Data from recaptures were used to calculate fuel deposition rates and stopover durations, whilst fat scores and body masses were used to calculate fuel loads and potential <b>flight</b> <b>ranges.</b> The majority of birds were carrying moderate fuel reserves and very few birds refuelled at the reedbed site; indeed, many appeared to remain at the site for just one day. Estimated <b>flight</b> <b>ranges</b> suggest that most birds were capable of flying to the southern half of France. Therefore {{it is suggested that}} British birds typically accumulate fuel north of the south coast, possibly at or close to their breeding grounds, and do not refuel until reaching southern France. This is supported by the pattern of birds recovered abroad. That birds stop at the south coast at all is attributed to the English Channel acting as a barrier to onward flights...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} P. exigua foragers {{leave the}} nest around 6am and foraging stops around 7pm. Foraging activity {{has been recorded}} from 11 to 12 am. In the hot and humid season, P. exigua exhibit greater nest activity than {{in the cold and}} dry season. Although the foraging of wasps decreases in rainy weather, the delivery of food and nest material does not stop completely. The habitat temperatures directly correlate with wasp activity: as the temperature increases, so does worker foraging. Luminosity has also been reported to influence {{the beginning and the end}} of the species’ foraging activity. Luminosity seems to have a greater affect on wasp activity when temperatures are more moderate. Additionally, wind speed directly impacts wasp activity; the stronger the wind, the less likely wasps are to exit their nests. Silva (2002) suggests P. exigua participate in a greater amplitude of activity as the latitude of their nesting region decreases. In other words, the closer the wasps are to the Equator, the more active the colonies are. In Ribeiro Jr.’s study on P. exigua from Brazil, he proposed that the wasp develops its foraging activities more efficiently within a <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> of 75m from its nest.|$|E

For Shuttle landing {{criteria and}} site selection determination, the Shuttle’s in-flight weather support, including landing forecasts, {{was provided by}} the National Weather Service’s Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Texas, in joint with the 45th Weather Squadron.

This is where the Orbiter was mated on top of a modified Boeing 747, known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, for the return flight to KSC. Edwards AFB desert landing runway was the primary backup site for returning Orbiters when the weather is severe at KSC.|$|E

2500|$|Canadian provinces {{are also}} served by air {{ambulance}} services. [...] These arrangements {{may come in}} a variety of forms, including direct service provision, contracts between private companies and the provincial government, or [...] "brokerage" [...] arrangements in which one private company takes the lead on service provision, perhaps even operating some of their own aircraft and providing dispatch services, but subcontracting many of the operations to smaller air charter services. In some cases, the inter-facility transport of high-acuity patients may be a mix of air-based and ground-based resources. Canada is a vast country, and its sheer size dictates that in many cases a helicopter-based air ambulance service [...] is impractical as the distances required exceed the <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> of the aircraft. For this reason, the use of fixed wing aircraft is commonplace. In some jurisdictions not all air ambulance calls are emergencies, since distances to tertiary care centres mean that some patients with lower-acuity medical conditions are also flown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} of the Netherlands contracts for air ambulance service, which is provided by four helicopters, {{all of which are}} in service around the clock. These helicopters are strategically located around the country to minimize response times. [...] Air units may perform high-acuity inter-facility transfers, or may also respond to the location where an emergency is occurring, to assist with immediate care or facilitate rapid transport of high-acuity victims.. [...] All air ambulance helicopters are staffed by both nurse and physicians. [...] The primary role of the helicopters is the rapid delivery of the Mobile Medical Team, and transport of the patient by aircraft, while possible, is not the preferred outcome. [...] In some cases, particularly for response to offshore emergencies, the civilian air ambulance system is supplemented by the three helicopters of the Search and Rescue service of the Netherlands Coastguard; using assets provided by the Dutch Navy and Dutch Air Force services. [...] All of these helicopters are transport-capable. Some areas of Holland also receive emergency air ambulance service from helicopters or vehicles based in Belgium and Germany, since these locations are beyond the normal <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> of the Dutch-owned aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The C. variipennis is {{less than}} 1 mm long, which makes it {{difficult}} to keep from livestock.

The max <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> for male C. variipennis is 0.8 km and for females 4.0 km, while the mean <b>flight</b> <b>range</b> is 1.89 km.
