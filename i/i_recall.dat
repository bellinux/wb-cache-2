5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet. Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept the game from being a debacle. <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>recall</b> my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E
25|$|I am {{ashamed of}} what I tell them: {{that they should}} indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not {{one of the women}} I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E
500|$|A.H. Jolly, Jr., {{captain of}} the 1933 golf team, noted: [...] "Truby, as he was {{referred}} to when out of earshot, was still a most active and attentive coach. But the only club or clubs <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> seeing him handle in those days, was a Left-Handed Putter!" ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to his death, Kaliokalani {{seemed to}} have been working as an {{interpreter}} in the Police Court with Charles Coffin Harris, a New England lawyer who later became a leading politician in the Kingdom. During his world tour in 1881 and upon learning of Harris's death, Kalākaua, who had also received his first instruction in law under Harris, wrote to their sister Liliʻuokalani reminiscing about their elder brother and his work as an interpreter: [...] "I feel it [...] the more when <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> the days of my childhood and that of our brother James Kaliokalani, who was our first instructor in Law and remained with him as assistant interpreter of the Police Court for two years".|$|E

[...] He complained that the Canadian team threw [...] "cucumbers and other leftovers" [...] at his colleague Franz Baader on the flight from Moscow to Prague and harassed visitors in hotels. Bobby Hull also criticized Team Canada, stating that the fighting and gestures of the Canadian players [...] "were a bad example to young players and diplomatically harmful." ...|$|E
500|$|... “The Parent Rap” was co-written by George Meyer and Mike Scully, and Mark Kirkland {{served as}} the {{director}} for the episode. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2001. [...] The title of the episode is a reference to The Parent Trap. Even though [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII" [...] - the first episode of the thirteenth season - had aired the previous week, [...] "The Parent Rap" [...] was considered the official premiere of the season. “The Parent Rap” was the last episode written in its production line. “As <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> we got {{toward the end of}} the season and we had to write another episode in a hurry”, said Meyer in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. Judge Constance Harm is a parody of Judge Judy.|$|E

500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment {{of confusion and}} despair, he opens the drawer of his desk and finds a Gideon Bible. He opens it [...] "randomly" [...] to , and reads from it: [...] "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." [...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
500|$|In 1912, the Guild of Poets {{published}} {{her book}} of verse Evening (Vecher) – {{the first of}} five in nine years. The small edition of 500 copies quickly sold out and she received around a dozen positive notices in the literary press. She exercised a strong selectivity for the pieces – including only 35 of the 200 poems she had written {{by the end of}} 1911. (She noted that Song of the Last Meeting, dated 29 September 1911, was her 200th poem). The book secured her reputation as a new and striking young writer, the poems Grey-eyed king, In the Forest, Over the Water and I don’t need my legs anymore making her famous. She later wrote [...] "These naïve poems by a frivolous girl for some reason were reprinted thirteen times [...] And they came out in several translations. The girl herself (as far as <b>I</b> <b>recall)</b> did not foresee such a fate for them and used to hide the issues of the journals in which they were first published under the sofa cushions".|$|E
500|$|Ten {{features}} a two-part track entitled [...] "Master/Slave" [...] that both opens {{and closes the}} album. The first part begins the album, before [...] "Once" [...] starts, {{and the second part}} closes the album, after [...] "Release". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Colfer's {{performances}} {{have been}} well received by critics, particularly [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye" [...] in the episode [...] "Born This Way". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic stated that the song was [...] "absolutely stunning in every conceivable way". She {{thought that he had}} the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability [...] "down pat". Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez also praised the rendition: [...] "Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than <b>I</b> <b>recall.</b> ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't think could have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble." [...] In his review, Michael Slezak of TVLine commended Kurt's voice and gave the song an [...] "A": [...] "I feel like we haven’t had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer’s countertenor to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit." [...] Rolling Stone Erica Futterman wrote that it was [...] "a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this train}} of {{reasoning}} I followed {{out in my}} mind, and when <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> the quizzical, cunning look which the rogue had given me when I asked for the despatch-box, I felt certainly assured that I was right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just because I wouldn't let them! You've got to last through harvest, anyway, and I guess Miss Haldane wouldn't {{have much}} {{use for a}} dead man," [...] said Sally, and was {{retiring}} with mischievous laughter, when <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|Luc. Perhaps--I cannot yet leave loving you. There 'twas. But <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> {{it in my}} mind, And made it false before I gave it air. Once more, farewell--I wo'not,-- Now I can say I wo'not, wo'not love you. [...] [Going.|$|R
