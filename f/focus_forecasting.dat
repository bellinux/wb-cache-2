40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} <b>focus</b> <b>forecasting</b> in a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) supply chain. <b>Focus</b> <b>forecasting</b> is tested in a real business case in a Serbian enterprise. The data used in the simulation refers to the historical sales of two types of FMCG with several different products. The data were collected and summarized across the whole distribution channel in the Serbian market from January 2012 to December 2013. We applied several well-known time series forecasting models using the <b>focus</b> <b>forecasting</b> approach, where for the future time period we used the method which had the best performances in the past. The <b>focus</b> <b>forecasting</b> approach mixes different standard forecasting methods on the data sets {{in order to find}} the one that was the most accurate during the past period. The accuracy of forecasting methods is defined through different measures of errors. In this paper we implemented the following forecasting models in Microsoft Excel: last period, all average, moving average, exponential smoothing with constant and variable parameter α, exponential smoothing with trend, exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality. The main purpose was not to evaluate different forecasting methods but to show a practical application of the <b>focus</b> <b>forecasting</b> approach in a real business case...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of volatility <b>forecasting</b> using <b>focused</b> selection and combination strategies to include relevant explanatory variables in the <b>forecasting</b> model. The <b>focused</b> selection/combination strategies consist of picking up the model that minimizes the estimated risk (e. g.

The methodology is applied to a daily recursive 1 [...] step ahead value [...] at [...] risk (VaR) forecasting exercise of 4 widely traded New York Stock Exchange stocks. Results show that VaR forecasts can significantly be improved upon using <b>focused</b> <b>forecast</b> strategies for the selection of relevant exogenous information.

Traditional information criteria {{do not appear to be}} helpful in suggesting the inclusion of explanatory variables that actually improve prediction significantly.

40|$|Prediction of {{physiological}} responses {{can have a}} number of applications in the health and medical fields. However, this can be a challenging task due to interdependencies between these responses, physical activities, environmental factors and the individual’s mental state. In this work, we <b>focus</b> on <b>forecasting</b> physiological responses in dynamic scenarios where individuals are performing exercises and complex activities of daily life. We minimize the effect of environmental and physiological factors in order to focus on the effect of physical activities. In particular, we <b>focus</b> on <b>forecasting</b> heart rate and respiratory rate due to their relevance in medical and fitness training. We aim to forecast these physiological responses up to 60 s into the future, study the effect of different predictors that incorporate different sensing modalities and different amounts of historical data and analyze the performance of various strategies for prediction. Activity information is incorporated by clustering the data streams and fitting different predictive models per cluster. The effect of clustering is also studied by performing a hierarchical analysis on the clustering parameter, and we observe that activity clustering does improve the performance in our proposed methodology when predicting physiological response across modalities...|$|R

50|$|The post-1945 boom in {{business}} theory led, in the 1950s and 1960s, to a <b>focus</b> on <b>forecasting</b> {{as a major}} component of planning.
