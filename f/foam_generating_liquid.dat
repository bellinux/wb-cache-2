40|$|The <b>foam</b> <b>generated</b> by {{the mixture}} of air and water has a much higher {{viscosity}} and lower mobility than those of pure water or gas that constitutes the air-water foam. The possibility of using the air-water foam as a flow barrier {{for the purpose of}} groundwater and soil remediation is explored in this paper. A nanoparticle-stabilized air-water foam was fabricated by vigorously stirring the nano-fluid in pressurized condition. The foam bubble size distribution was analyzed with a microscope. The viscosities of <b>foams</b> <b>generated</b> with the solutions with several nanoparticle concentrations were measured as a function of time. The breakthrough pressure of foam-saturated microfluidic chips and sand columns were obtained. The hydraulic conductivity of a foam-filled sand column was measured after foam breakthrough. The results show that: (1) bubble coalescence and the Ostwald ripening are believed to be the reason of bubble size distribution change; (2) the viscosity of nanoparticle-stabilized foam and the breakthrough pressures decreased with time once the foam was generated; (3) the hydraulic conductivity of the foam-filled sand column was almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of a water-saturated sand column even after the foam-breakthrough. Based on the results in this study, the nanoparticle-stabilized air-water foam could be injected into contaminated soils to generate vertical barriers for temporary hydraulic conductivity reduction...|$|R

The analysis is based on experimental data reported in the literature and covers a wide range of physico-chemical properties, bubble sizes and shapes, and flow regimes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to compare in normal human subjects the differential effects on postural stability of introducing somatosensory noise via compliant and/or sway-referenced support surfaces during quiet standing. The use of foam surfaces (two thicknesses: thin (0. 95 cm) and thick (7. 62 cm)) and sway-referenced support allowed comparison between two different types of destabilizing factors that increased ankle/foot somatosensory noise. Under some conditions neck extensions were used to increase sensory noise by deviating the vestibular system from its optimal orientation for balance control. The impact of these conditions on postural control was assessed through objective measures of instability. Thick foam and sway-referenced support conditions generated comparable instability in subjects, as measured by equilibrium score and minimum time-to-contact. However, simultaneous application of the conditions resulted in greater instability, suggesting a higher level of generated sensory noise and thus, different receptor types affected during each manipulation. Indeed, sway-referenced support generated greater anterior-posterior center-of-mass (COM) sway, while thick <b>foam</b> <b>generated</b> greater medio-lateral COM sway and velocity. Neck extension had minimal effect on postural stability until combined with simultaneous thick foam and sway-referenced support. Thin <b>foam</b> never <b>generated</b> enough sensory noise to affect postural stability even with noise added by sway-reference support or neck extension. These results provide an interesting window into the central integration of redundant sensory information and indicate the postural impact of sensory inputs is not solely based on their existence, but also their level of noise...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of an ongoing study of CO 2 foam {{mobility}} control in the Reservoir Physics group at the Department of Physics and Technology (IFT) at the University of Bergen. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate stabilization of foam and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using hydrophilic silica nanoparticles and anionic AOS surfactants as foam agents. <b>Foam</b> was <b>generated</b> by co-injection of an aqueous foam agent solution and CO 2 as the gaseous phase. <b>Foam</b> is <b>generated</b> in-situ as the two fluids are mixed in the porous medium, resulting in a mobility reduction of CO 2. Miscible CO 2 and CO 2 -foam injection tests using surfactants as a foaming agent were performed to study the effect on tertiary EOR in carbonate reservoirs. The experiments were conducted in strongly water-wet, fractured and un-fractured Edward limestone core plugs. Foam is used for mobility control by blocking high permeable zones, resulting in a delay of gas breakthrough and significantly improve the macroscopic sweep efficiency. Supercritical CO 2 injections increased on average oil recovery by 20 % OOIP compared to ordinary water injection. The highest recovery (63 % OOIP) was obtained by first injecting supercritical CO 2 followed by CO 2 -foam. <b>Foam</b> was <b>generated</b> in-situ in cores without fractures, verified by increased pressure drop. Foam generation in fractured was poor, mainly due to lack of generation sites, low stability and high oil saturation. The limited stability of surfactant-generated foam in presence of oil, combined with high reservoir temperature and high salinity are among reasons why foam is not being widely used as a common EOR method. Nanoparticles are reported to work as foam stabilizers and are chemically stable in a wider range of reservoir conditions than surfactants. Experimental investigations using nanoparticles as foaming agents, without the presence of oil, were therefore conducted in this thesis. The sensitivity in parameters such as gas fraction, total injection rate and injection strategies using nanoparticles to <b>generate</b> <b>foam</b> were investigated. The pressure drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved mobility reduction factor (MRF) and the apparent viscosity of the <b>generated</b> <b>foam.</b> The result shows that independent of the gas fraction an increase in injection rate lead to a higher pressure drop. The apparent viscosity of the foam increased with higher gas fractions for some, but not all injections. The inconsistency is caused by a significant hysteresis effect. Common for the injection experiments is that high liquid or high gas fraction <b>generates</b> <b>foam</b> with a lower apparent viscosity...|$|R
