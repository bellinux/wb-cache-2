5|$|The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children began {{referring}} {{to it as}} female <b>genital</b> mutilation in 1990, and the World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit in 1991. Other English terms include female <b>genital</b> cutting (FGC) and female <b>genital</b> mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), preferred by {{those who work with}} practitioners.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} HPV {{transmission}} between hands and <b>genitals</b> {{of the same}} person and sexual partners. Hernandez tested the <b>genitals</b> and dominant hand of each person in 25 couples every other month {{for an average of}} seven months. She found two couples where the man's <b>genitals</b> infected the woman's hand with high-risk HPV, two where her hand infected his <b>genitals,</b> one where her <b>genitals</b> infected his hand, two each where he infected his own hand, and she infected her own hand. Hands were not the main source of transmission in these 25 couples, but they were significant.|$|R

5|$|<b>Genital</b> herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble <b>genital</b> herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of <b>genital</b> herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause <b>genital</b> warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. <b>Genital</b> warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|Risk of {{transmission}} {{increases in the}} presence of many sexually transmitted infections and <b>genital</b> ulcers. <b>Genital</b> ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold. Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk {{of transmission}}.|$|E
5000|$|African bat bugs Afrocimex constrictus also perform extra-genitalic {{traumatic}} insemination. Males will puncture {{the female}} outside her <b>genitals</b> and ultimately inseminate them. It was observed that {{both males and}} females suffer from traumatic insemination. Males suffer from traumatic insemination because they expressed female like <b>genitals,</b> and were often at times mistaken for females. Females also displayed polymorphism because some females had distinct [...] "female-like" [...] <b>genitals</b> while others had a [...] "male-like" [...] appearance. The results showed that males along with females who had [...] "male-like" [...] <b>genitals</b> suffer less traumatic insemination compared to the distinct females. Female polymorphism could in fact be a result of evolution due to sexual conflict.|$|R

5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other {{for up to six}} hours, {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the <b>genital</b> pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its <b>genital</b> pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's <b>genital</b> pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E

5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding <b>genital</b> modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. <b>Genital</b> modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the <b>genitals</b> in both sexes. Female <b>genitals</b> are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male <b>genitals</b> may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|R
5|$|Female <b>genital</b> {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known}} as female <b>genital</b> cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and <b>genital</b> piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes <b>genital</b> piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a <b>genital</b> piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the <b>genital</b> {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the <b>genital</b> tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the <b>genital</b> tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E

50|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} usually {{consists of}} touching the <b>genitals</b> or other erogenous zones. Masturbation, erotic massage, sexual intercourse, a handjob or fingering are types of physical sexual stimulation involving the <b>genitals.</b> Sexual arousal is usually triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts, which cause {{the release of}} pleasure-causing chemicals (endorphins) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become sexually aroused by touching another person's <b>genitals</b> or other body parts. The bulbocavernosus reflex is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris.|$|R
50|$|Another fMRI {{study showed}} {{heterosexual}} and homosexual {{men and women}} photographs of aroused male and female <b>genitals.</b> By limiting the visual sexual stimulus to photographs of <b>genitals,</b> the authors minimized neuronal activity related to neuronal processing of various stimuli such as faces, voices, body movements, and sexually arousing body parts other than <b>genitals.</b> They found that the ventral striatum, centromedian thalamus and bilateral ventral premotor cortex showed a stronger response to photographs of aroused <b>genitals</b> of the preferred sex relative to corresponding photographs of the non-preferred sex. As the ventral striatum and centromedian thalamus {{are known to be}} activated by innate preferences, the selective responsiveness of these regions to preferred sexual stimuli appears to reflect a predetermined response pattern. This notion is supported by evidence that sexual orientation is biological in origin.|$|R
