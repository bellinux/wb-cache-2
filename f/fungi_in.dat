5|$|Because of {{similarities}} in morphology and lifestyle, the slime molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly {{classified in the}} kingdom <b>Fungi,</b> <b>in</b> groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime molds were studied also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Coprolites {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Lameta Formation, {{and the presence of}} <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> coprolites indicates that leaves were eaten by the dinosaurs which lived in a tropical or subtropical climate. Another scientific study of similarities in egg taxa suggested close phyletic relationships that supports the existence of a terrestrial connection between dinosaurian fauna in India and Europe during the Cretaceous, and between two Gondwanan areas, Patagonia and India.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the development of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> {{defense is}} a very common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

5|$|The Eccrinales and Amoebidiales are opisthokont protists, {{previously}} {{thought to be}} zygomycete fungi. Other groups now in Opisthokonta (e.g., Corallochytrium, Ichthyosporea) were also at given time classified as fungi. The genus Blastocystis, now in Stramenopiles, was originally classified as a yeast. Ellobiopsis, now in Alveolata, was considered a chytrid. The bacteria were also included in <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> some classifications, as the group Schizomycetes.|$|E
5|$|The Russulaceae are {{a diverse}} family of <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the order Russulales, with roughly 1,900 known species and a {{worldwide}} distribution. They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These gilled mushrooms are characterised by the brittle flesh of their fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other tooth <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the genus Hydnum: H.imbricatum, H.repandum, and H.tomentosum. In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H.auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, Auriscalpium, to contain it. In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare.|$|E

5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and <b>fungi.</b> <b>In</b> captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E
5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the subgenus included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis, as {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E

5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near {{the periphery of the}} cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> Saguaro National Park.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, having been recorded from Europe, North, Central, and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In British Columbia, Canada, {{it is sometimes}} found on maple, poplar, or pine, but is most abundant on red alder. It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic to wet. The fungus grows parasitically on the mycelium of wood-rotting corticioid <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> the genus Peniophora. Occasionally, T.mesenterica and its host fungus can be found fruiting together.|$|E

5|$|Typically {{found in}} {{coniferous}} forests, G.clavatus is mycorrhizal, and {{is associated with}} tree species {{in a variety of}} coniferous genera, particularly spruces and firs. It is more common at elevations of greater than , in moist, shady areas with plenty of leaf litter. Although widespread, G.clavatus has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national Red Lists of threatened <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> 17 European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac <b>fungi,</b> <b>in</b> which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
5|$|After showing {{interest}} {{in natural sciences}} in his youth, he studied at the University of Innsbruck. However, his university career was interrupted {{by the need to}} complete military service. He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II, before being captured and placed in a prisoner of war camp. He was released in 1948, subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies. After completing his doctorate in 1950, Moser worked in England for six months, researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Upon his return to Austria, he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute, where he remained until 1968, taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> <b>in</b> reforestation. He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956, and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of Microbiology in Austria. He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991. His studies continued until his death in 2002. An influential mycologist, he received a number of awards throughout his life, and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour.|$|E
