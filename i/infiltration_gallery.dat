40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the tracer infiltration test were to 1) determine whether field-scale hydraulic properties for the compacted roadbed materials and underlying Hanford fm. sediments comprising the zone of water table fluctuation beneath the site are consistent with estimates based laboratory-scale measurements on core samples and 2) characterize wetting front advancement and distribution of soil moisture achieved for the selected application rate. These primary objectives were met. The test successfully demonstrated that 1) the remaining 2 to 3 ft of compacted roadbed material below the <b>infiltration</b> <b>gallery</b> does not limit infiltration rates to levels that {{would be expected to}} eliminate near surface application as a viable amendment delivery approach and 2) the combined aqueous and geophysical monitoring approaches employed at this site, with some operational adjustments based on lessons learned, provides an effective means of assessing wetting front advancement and the distribution of soil moisture achieved for a given solution application. Reasonably good agreement between predicted and observed tracer and moisture front advancement rates was observed. During the first tracer infiltration test, which used a solution application rate of 0. 7 cm/hr, tracer arrivals were observed at the water table (10 to 12 ft below the bottom of the <b>infiltration</b> <b>gallery)</b> after approximately 5 days, for an advancement rate of approximately 2 ft/day. This advancement rate is generally consistent with pre-test modeling results that predicted tracer arrival at the water table after approximately 5 days (see Figure 8, bottom left panel). This agreement indicates that hydraulic property values specified in the model for the compacted roadbed materials and underlying Hanford formation sediments, which were based on laboratory-scale measurements, are reasonable estimates of actual field-scale conditions. Additional work is needed to develop a working relationship between resistivity change and the associated change in moisture content so that 4 D images of moisture content change can be generated.

The optimal allocation of these infrastructures can {{be decided by}} solving a multi-objective optimization problem balancing availability of fresh water supply and installation/operation costs, where the effects of different design options on the planning objectives are simulated through a high fidelity model of the flow and transport processes. The incorporation of these simulation models within an optimization-based planning framework is not always straightforward because of the computational requirements of the model itself and the computational limitations of the optimization algorithms.

The GIRS methodology is used to recursively build a non-dynamic emulator of the processbased model that maps the design options into the objectives values and can be used in place of the original model to more quickly explore the design option space. The approach is used to plan infrastructural interventions for controlling saltwater intrusion and ensuring sustainable groundwater supply for Nauru, a Pacific island republic in Micronesia. GIRS is used to emulate a SEAWAT density driven groundwater flow-and-transport simulation model.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the three-dimensional (3 D) inversion results of surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data collected over the Hanford Site B-Complex. The {{data were collected}} in order to image the subsurface distribution of electrically conductive vadose zone contamination resulting from both planned releases of contamination into subsurface <b>infiltration</b> <b>galleries</b> (cribs, trenches, and tile fields), as well as unplanned releases from the B, BX, and BY tank farms and/or associated facilities. Electrically conductive contaminants are those which increase the ionic strength of pore fluids compared to native conditions, which comprise most types of solutes released into the subsurface B-Complex. The ERT data were collected and originally inverted as described in detail in report RPP- 34690 Rev 0., 2007, which readers should refer to for {{a detailed description of}} data collection and waste disposal history. Although the ERT imaging results presented in that report successfully delineated the footprint of vadose zone contamination in areas outside of the tank farms, imaging resolution was not optimized due to the inability of available inversion codes to optimally process the massive ERT data set collected at the site. Recognizing these limitations and the potential for enhanced ERT characterization and time-lapse imaging at contaminated sites, a joint effort was initiated in 2007 by the U. S. Department of Energy – Office of Science (DOE-SC), with later support by the Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM), and the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD), to develop a high-performance distributed memory parallel 3 D ERT inversion code capable of optimally processing large ERT data sets. The culmination of this effort was the development of E 4 D (Johnson et al., 2010, 2012) In 2012, under the Deep Vadose Zone Applied Field Research Initiative (DVZ-AFRI), the U. S. Department of Energy – Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and CH 2 M Hill Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) commissioned an effort for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to re-invert the ERT data collected over the B-Complex using E 4 D, with the objective to improve imaging resolution and better understand the distribution of vadose zone contamination at the B-Complex. The details and results of that effort as documented in this report display a significant improvement in ERT image resolution, revealing the nature and orientation of contaminant plumes originating in former <b>infiltration</b> <b>galleries</b> and extending toward the water table. In particular, large plumes originating in the BY-Cribs area appear to have intercepted, or are close to intercepting the water table after being diverted eastward, possibly by the same low permeability unit causing perched water north of the B-Tank Farm boundary. Contaminant plumes are also evident beneath the BX-Trenches, but do not appear to have intercepted the water table. Imaging results within the tank farms themselves are highly biased by the dense network of electrically conductive tanks and dry wells, and are therefore inconclusive concerning contaminant distributions beneath tanks. However, beneath the diversion boxes, the results do reveal highly conductive anomalies that are not associated with metallic infrastructure, and may be diagnostic of extensive contamination. Overall, the parallel ERT inversion provides additional detail concerning contaminated zones in terms of conductive anomalies. These anomalies are consistent with waste disposal histories, and in several cases reveal lateral contaminant transport caused by heterogeneity within the vadose zone...|$|R

Emissions testing was performed to obtain a qualitative picture of VOC losses to the atmosphere. The sampling and analytical methodologies for the emissions tests are presented in the following subsections. F. 1. 1 Dynamic Surface Emissions Sampling Methodology A dynamic surface emissions sampling method was used at the LC 34 site. This method involves enclosing an area of soil under an inert box designed to allow the purging of the enclosure with high-purity air (Dupont, 1987). The box was purged with high-purity air for two hours to remove any ambient air from the region above the soil and to allow equilibrium to be established between the VOCs emitted from the soil and the organic-free air.

40|$|The John Day is the nation's second longest {{free-flowing}} {{river in}} the contiguous United States and the longest containing entirely unsupplemented runs of anadromous fish. Located in eastern Oregon, the basin drains over 8, 000 square miles, Oregon's fourth largest drainage basin, and incorporates portions of eleven counties. Originating in the Strawberry Mountains near Prairie City, the John Day River flows 284 miles in a northwesterly direction, entering the Columbia River approximately four miles upstream of the John Day dam. With wild runs of spring Chinook salmon and summer steelhead, westslope cutthroat, and redband and bull trout, the John Day system is truly a basin with national significance. The majority of the John Day basin was ceded to the Federal government in 1855 by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (Tribes). In 1997, the Tribes established {{an office in the}} basin to coordinate restoration projects, monitoring, planning and other watershed activities on private and public lands. Once established, the John Day Basin Office (JDBO) formed a partnership with the Grant Soil and Water Conservation District (GSWCD), also located in the town of John Day, who contracts the majority of the construction implementation activities for these projects from the JDBO. The GSWCD completes the landowner contact, preliminary planning, engineering design, permitting, construction contracting, and construction implementation phases of most projects. The JDBO completes the planning, grant solicitation/defense, environmental compliance, administrative contracting, monitoring, and reporting portion of the program. Most phases of project planning, implementation, and monitoring are coordinated with the private landowners and basin agencies, such as the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and Oregon Water Resources Department. In 2002, the JDBO and GSWCD proposed continuation of their successful partnership between the two agencies and basin landowners to implement an additional twelve (12) watershed conservation projects.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many rural communities in arid {{areas of the world}} make extensive use of perennial water supplies retained within the sediment of a river channel. This naturally filtered water provides for their basic subsistence. A general term applied to the abstraction of water from river sediment is sand-abstraction. Ephemeral and seasonal rivers primarily drain the dryland regions of the world. These arid regions are typically subject to extensive environmental degradation with a consequent high degree of surface erosion. As a result, many of the rivers have become sand rivers, filled with copious amounts of sediment. Most arid areas are subject to occasional rainstorms and flash floods that immediately drain to waterways and saturate the sediment within the river channel. In larger rivers a perennial supply of water is maintained within the sediment. Despite a perceived potential for this water resource there has been little development of any small-scale technology that is suitable for use at a basic rural level. A research and study programme was instigated to assess fully, the potential of such a resource. Field research was undertaken to characterise typical sand rivers and to assess the water storage and water loss and retention factors within river sediment. A check list for identifying possible sand-abstraction sites was devised. In the process of this study the advantages of storing water in sand was fully appreciated and attention given to the development of initially less suitable sites in serious water deficit areas. Systems for efficient abstraction of water were reviewed and designs formulated for the fabrication of equipment to mechanically draw water from river sediment. A series of well-screens, well-points, <b>infiltration</b> <b>galleries</b> and caissons have been designed and initial tests have been conducted under field conditions. Simple technology handpumps that it was considered could be operated, maintained and repaired by rural communities using locally available materials have been developed in conjunction with the abstraction equipment. In consultation with rural people an analysis was made of the technical and sociological requirements that are considered essential for the sustainability of technology suitable for use by disadvantaged rural communities. Both practical and literature research has indicated the latent possibility of this technology. Interaction has been maintained with four communities throughout the research and development period and contributions and indications received are {{that there is a need}} to develop such a water source with an upgraded technology. The conclusion from the work undertaken is that development of the technology is worthwhile and that greater efforts should be made to promote it at a small-scale, rural level. In addition the potential to provide clean water in arid regions from such a lowtechnology application should be drawn to the attention of professional water engineers...|$|R

Which phenomenon taking place at this boundary would depend upon the condition imposed on the seepage region. For example, in Fig. 1, corresponding to the seepage flow into a ditch in the confined aquifer, the seepage face is formed at one portion of the pervious boundary facing to the atmosphere. In this case, the phenomenon in which the whole pervious boundary becomes the seepage face can not take place under the condition that Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law is valid. In Fig. 7, corresponding to the flow into an <b>infiltration</b> <b>gallery</b> in the stratified stratum, there are two following cases in accordance with the stratum conditions and boundary conditions. One is the seepage face formed at the whole gallery wall and the other is the one formed partly. The author has proposed the method of analyzing the problems of the steady saturated seepage flow with the seepage face but without the free surface under the following assumptions. (1) Water starts or stops seeping out of the porous medium towards the atmosphere when the water pressure increases or decreases and finally equal to the atmospheric pressure. (2) Water and air do not flow into the porous medium from the atmosphere. Using this method, the above mentioned seepage flows were analyzed and sufficient results explaining these phenomena were obtained. Whether the air flows into the porous medium or not through the pervious boundary can be judged from this results. 自由水面をもたない浸透領域における,浸出面の形成をともなう浸透流について取り扱った. このとき浸出面は大気に接した透水性境界で形成されるが,この境界で生じる現象には,全部分が浸出面である場合と一部分は浸出面で他の部分は不透水性境界の役割を果たすような場合とがある. このいずれの場合が生じるかは浸透領域の条件によって決まるが,本研究では,浸透水が浸出開始および停止するときの圧力は大気圧に等しいと仮定し,さらに水が存在しない大気中から水が透水層内に流入することはないことを考慮して,自由水面をともなわない浸出面をもつ飽和浸透流問題の解析方法を示した. また応用例として被圧地下水排水溝における被圧地下水流,成層透水層における満流していない集水暗きょへの浸透流の問題をとりあげ解析を行なった...|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{enhanced}} infiltration {{sites for}} the control of stormwater runoff in developed areas is becoming a common practice among municipalities, departments of transportation, other government entities, and private entities. One {{of the purposes of}} enhanced filtration is to control the volume and rate of runoff from developed areas {{in order to keep the}} level of runoff close to that of undeveloped conditions. Another purpose is to capture the stormwater so that contaminants contained in the stormwater will be treated through the process of water infiltrating and flowing through the soil profile. With the increasing adoption of enhanced infiltration practices there is a growing concern that these practices might be putting the quality of the groundwater resources underlying some of these practices in jeopardy. In recent years there have been some efforts to quantify the potential for degradation of groundwater resources by infiltrated stormwater. The study described in this report is an effort to quantify the potential for contaminants to reach the groundwater resources in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota. A literature review was first conducted to identify concerns with regard to groundwater contamination and the extent of the research that has been completed with regard to these issues. The field study was then conducted over a period of 18 months in which three sites containing enhanced infiltration practices were monitored to quantify the amount of contaminants reaching depths large enough to infer that the contaminants would eventually reach the underlying surficial aquifer. The sites investigated included an infiltration basin near the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota (referred to as the Sheep Pasture, SP), a large infiltrating rain garden located within Como Park (referred to as the Hamline-Midway Ave. site, HM), and an <b>infiltration</b> <b>gallery</b> constructed in a formerly industrial area located at Beacon Bluff (referred to as BB) in the eastern side of St. Paul. These sites were selected from a number of potential sites based on the criteria: 1) should have been functioning long enough to contain contaminants; (2) be local for convenience of access; and (3) represent one of the infiltration practices that are of primary concern with regard to groundwater pollution...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demands for}} {{groundwater}} by agriculture, industries, and municipalities have {{raised concerns about}} the future availability of groundwater in Iowa. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature began funding a comprehensive Water Resources Management program, which was implemented by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. A key aspect {{of the program is}} to evaluate and quantify the groundwater resources across the state using computer simulation models. These models help answer questions such as: “How much water can be pumped from an aquifer over 10, 20, or 100 years?” or “Will my well go dry?” A groundwater study was initiated to understand the shallow groundwater resources in the Lower Raccoon River aquifer. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the aquifer for future water supply development under drought conditions. A groundwater flow model of the Lower Raccoon River aquifer was created using Visual MODFLOW 2011. 1. The model was used to generate source water capture zones, evaluate surface water and groundwater interaction, and estimate maximum sustainable pumping rates. Water level data during the summer of 2012 were used to help calibrate the model. Based on the mass balance calculations in the model, the percentage of water production supplied by the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) was 52 percent, and 29 percent was supplied by induced recharge from the numerous sand and gravel quarries. The remaining 19 percent of the water production is supplied by precipitation recharge and groundwater inflow into the model area. The percentage of induced recharge varied from 0 percent at Van Meter to 89 percent at Des Moines Water Works radial wellfield. Induced recharge from the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) allows public wells to maintain water production during prolonged dry periods. Limitations in water production exist when streamflow along the Raccoon River drops below 17. 1 cubic feet per second (43. 4 cfs if the Fleur Drive <b>infiltration</b> <b>gallery</b> is included). Based on available pumping records, an average of 14. 6 billion gallons of water are pumped from the Lower Raccoon River aquifer each year. Additional water production is available from the aquifer, but limitations exist during extremely dry years. Additional pumping capacity ranges from 10 percent in the West Des Moines wellfield, to over 1, 000 percent at Adel. Potential well yields greater than 500 gallons per minute (gpm) are found near Adel, Van Meter, and West Des Moines. The highest potential well yields occur east of Adel, and are the result of the cobble and boulder zone found at the base of the aquifer, and the abundance of induced recharge from the nearby sand and gravel quarries and the Raccoon River.
