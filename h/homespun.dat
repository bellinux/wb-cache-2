5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (<b>homespun</b> cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E
5|$|Levski {{began his}} {{education}} {{at a school}} in Karlovo, studying <b>homespun</b> tailoring as a local craftsman's apprentice. In 1855, Levski's uncle Basil—archimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monastery—took him to Stara Zagora, where he attended school and worked as Basil's servant. Afterward, Levski joined a clerical training course. On 7 December 1858, he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the religious name Ignatius (Игнатий, Ignatiy) and was promoted in 1859 to hierodeacon, which later inspired one of Levski's informal nicknames, The Deacon (Дякона, Dyakona).|$|E

50|$|She {{arrived in}} Montreal in 1929 with a loom and a sewing machine. She began to sell handwoven goods, and as demand for her fabrics increased, she {{established}} Canada <b>Homespuns.</b> Canada <b>Homespuns</b> {{is believed to}} be Canada's first professional weaving studio; it employed as many as 70 weavers. From 1933 to 1949, she operated her own weaving school, and many of her pupils went on to become instructors themselves. Her products became iconic Canadian items, carried in high-end stores as well as Eaton's and Simpsons. Bulow also received commissions from various companies, including Trans-Canada Air Lines, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway and the Bank of Nova Scotia. She sold her company, later known as Karen Bulow Ltd., in 1960. At the request of the Canadian government, she helped establish a weaving studio for the Inuit people at Pangnirtung. In 1976, she was named an honorary member in the Canadian Crafts Council and she was also admitted to the Royal Canadian Academy.|$|R

25|$|In Clement Attlee's post-war government, Key was {{appointed}} Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health. He shared responsibility for passing the National Health Service Act with Aneurin Bevan; the contrast in their styles, with Bevan's exuberant manner of speech differing markedly from Key's <b>homespun</b> wisdom, was noted. Unfortunately it was Key's successor, John Edwards, {{who had the}} honour of finally abolishing the Poor Law.|$|E
25|$|Copperas Rock {{has been}} stained a coppery-yellow color by ferrous sulfate that has leached {{from a small}} coal deposit. Ferrous sulfate is {{a leading cause of}} stream {{pollution}} in the streams of Pennsylvania, but the small amounts found in the Copperas Rock area are not enough to cause a significant problem in Great Trough Creek. A small cave found near Copperas Rock is thought to have been carved out by early settlers who used the ferrous sulfate mordant to set dyes to <b>homespun</b> fabrics.|$|E
50|$|In May 1933 it was {{announced}} that the Canadian Handicrafts Guild had received letters of support from leaders and organizations across the country for their planned exhibition in Montreal for the end of October. It was planned to bring Quebec handicraft workers from their farms to Montreal to demonstrate their work. Some would be seeing the city for the first time.Participating organization included the Guild's branches in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, the Art Association of Montreal, the Women's Art Society, Montreal, and Union Catholique des Cultivateurs, the Handicrafts Association of Canada of Toronto and the Mount Allison Handicrafts Guild of Sackville, New Brunswick.Products exhibited would include <b>homespuns,</b> tweed from a blend of angora and sheep's wool, Indian basketwork, hooked rugs, quilt, blankets and furniture.|$|R
60|$|With a gay smile she {{pinned to}} Philip's coat the flower {{she had just}} picked in the garden. He blushed and felt foolish. He knew that Miss Wilkinson was the {{daughter}} of his Uncle William's last rector, and he had a wide acquaintance with the daughters of clergymen. They wore ill-cut clothes and stout boots. They were generally dressed in black, for in Philip's early years at Blackstable <b>homespuns</b> had not reached East Anglia, and the ladies of the clergy did not favour colours. Their hair was done very untidily, and they smelt aggressively of starched linen. They considered the feminine graces unbecoming and looked the same whether they were old or young. They bore their religion arrogantly. The closeness of their connection with the church made them adopt a slightly dictatorial attitude to the rest of mankind.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{as the man}} {{stepped out}} on to the massive stone balcony of his house, the wind dropped, and a red flaring sun dipped behind the towering {{mountains}} which guarded the city westwards and eastwards. A roar of greeting welcomed his appearance, and {{while he waited for}} silence his eyes rested fondly upon the long line of iron-bound hills, stern and silent guardians of the city of his birth. For a moment he forgot his ambitions and the long unswerving pursuit of his great desire. The love of his country was born in the man--the better part of him was steeped in patriotic fervour. And most of all, he loved this ancient city amongst the hills, the capital of the State, where many generations of his family had lived and died. Dear to him were its squares and narrow streets, the ancient stone houses, the many picturesque records of its great age ever, as it seemed to him, frowning with a stern and magnificent serenity amongst the tawdry evidences of later days and the irresistible march of modernity. The wine-shops of a hundred years ago flourished still {{side by side with the}} more pretentious cafés, half French, half Russian, which had sprung up like mushrooms about the city. The country-made <b>homespuns,</b> the glassware and metal work, heritage of generations of craftsmen, survived still the hideous competition of cheap Lancashire productions and Brummagem ware. The picturesque old fought a brave battle with the tinsel and tawdriness of the new. If Nicholas of Reist could have had his way he would have built an impenetrable wall against this slow poison, the unwelcome heritage of western progress. He would have thrust the ages back a century and built bulwarks about his beloved country. He looked downwards, and his heart grew warm within him. Many of the people who shouted his name were from the country districts and wore the picturesque garb of their forefathers long extinct in the city. The sight of their eager, upturned faces was dear to him. Some day they should be his people indeed. It should be his country to rule as he thought best. He felt himself at that moment a patriot pure and simple.|$|R
25|$|Ready-made {{clothing}} {{was available for}} all classes, at a price; {{the cost of a}} new cloak for an ordinary commoner might represent three fifths of their annual subsistence. Clothing was recycled down the social scale, until it fell to rags. Centonarii ("patch-workers") made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches. Owners of slave-run farms and sheep-flocks were advised that whenever the opportunity arose, female slaves should be fully occupied in the production of <b>homespun</b> woolen cloth; this would likely be good enough for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor.|$|E
25|$|In September 1944, Chikatilo {{began his}} schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was {{physically}} weak and regularly attended school in <b>homespun</b> clothing and, by 1946, with his stomach swollen from hunger {{resulting from the}} post-war famine which plagued much of the Soviet Union. On several occasions, this hunger caused Chikatilo to faint {{both at home and}} at school, and he was consistently targeted by bullies who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, Chikatilo and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father, Roman, was a kind man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of severe supply problems, {{as well as the}} lack of textile {{factories}} in the Confederacy and the successful Union naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, <b>homespun</b> uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as butternut (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure Union Army uniform parts from captured supplies and dead Union soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.|$|E
500|$|Letter {{consists}} of 28 short essays, {{which includes a}} few poems and a commencement address, and is dedicated to [...] "the daughter she never had". [...] Reviews of the book were generally positive; most reviewers recognized that the book was full of Angelou's wisdom and that it read like words of advice from a beloved grandmother or aunt.

500|$|Sunday's <b>homespun</b> preaching had a wide {{appeal to}} his audiences, who were [...] "entertained, reproached, exhorted, and astonished." [...] Sunday {{claimed to be}} [...] "an old-fashioned preacher of the old-time religion" [...] and his {{uncomplicated}} sermons spoke of a personal God, salvation through Jesus Christ, and following the moral lessons of the Bible. Sunday's theology, although sometimes denigrated as simplistic, was situated within the mainstream Protestantism of his time.|$|E

In the NME, Neil Spencer said that, following [...] "You", [...] "hopes of Hari's revival are comprehensively dashed by five-and-a-half minutes of the inordinately dreary 'The Answer's At The End'". Spencer described it as [...] "one of Hari's <b>Homespun</b> Homilies full of crusty chunks of potted wisdom".|$|E
500|$|Dillinger {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police <b>homespun</b> {{advice on how to}} catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so quickly that Variety joked that [...] "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president." [...] Hays wrote a cablegram to all the studios in March 1934 mandating that Dillinger not be portrayed in any motion picture.|$|E
500|$|This {{aspect of}} the {{basement}} recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound {{came as a shock}} to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, [...] "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [...] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." [...] Dylan summed up the gap: [...] "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these <b>homespun</b> ballads." ...|$|E
500|$|Both McWhorter and scholar Hilton Als found Angelou's writing {{throughout}} her series self-important. [...] Although McWhorter has admitted to being charmed by Angelou's sense of authority she has inserted into her works, {{which he calls}} her [...] "black-mother wit", he considered Angelou's autobiographies after Caged Bird [...] "smug", and has stated that she [...] "implicitly dares the reader to question her private line to God and Truth". [...] Als agreed, stating what made Song different from her preceding volumes is her [...] "ever-increasing unreliability". [...] Als stated that Angelou, in her six autobiographies, [...] "has given us... the self-aggrandizing, <b>homespun,</b> and sometimes oddly prudish story of a black woman who, {{when faced with the}} trials of life, simply makes do". Als believed that Angelou's essays, written in the 1990s, were a better culmination of her work as an autobiographer.|$|E
500|$|The Lovejoy Columns {{supported}} the Lovejoy Ramp, a [...] viaduct that stretched from Northwest 14th Avenue and Lovejoy Street to the Broadway Bridge. It {{was constructed in}} 1927–1928. Between 1948 and 1952, Athanasios Efthimiou [...] "Tom" [...] Stefopoulos (died 1971), a Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway night watchman, artist and master calligrapher in the copperplate style, drew upon the columns in chalk and later painted them. His work was spontaneous and not commissioned. Stefopoulos painted Greek mythology and Americana imagery in a calligraphic style; the designs depicted [...] "fanciful" [...] owls, landscapes [...] "bedecked with <b>homespun</b> aphorisms", and ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope navigating the streets of Athens with a lantern. He painted around a dozen murals, though photographic evidence does not exist for each of them. The paintings became a local landmark and quickly gained Stefopoulos notoriety and media coverage.|$|E
500|$|This system changed {{under the}} British, when tax {{payments}} {{were made in}} cash, and {{were used for the}} maintenance of the army, police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the [...] "Indian tribute". Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the <b>homespun</b> textile industry suffered during British rule, {{with the exception of the}} producers of the finest cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses. This was due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in spinning and weaving.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing <b>homespun</b> advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a <b>homespun</b> version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, several real life criminals became celebrities. Two in {{particular}} captured the American imagination: Al Capone and John Dillinger. Gangsters like Capone had transformed {{the perception of}} entire towns. Capone gave Chicago its [...] "reputation as the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommygun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages." [...] Capone appeared {{on the cover of}} Time magazine in 1930. He was even offered seven figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined. Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police <b>homespun</b> advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so fast that Variety joked [...] "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president."

500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the {{best thing that ever happened}} to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either <b>homespun</b> or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1927, she {{established}} Val-Kill Industries with Nancy Cook, Marion Dickerman, and Caroline O'Day, {{three friends}} she met through her {{activities in the}} Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Party. It was located {{on the banks of}} a stream that flowed through the Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, New York. Roosevelt and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture, pewter, and <b>homespun</b> cloth using traditional craft methods. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Colonial Revival, most Val-Kill products were modeled on eighteenth-century forms. Roosevelt promoted Val-Kill through interviews and public appearances. Val-Kill Industries never became the subsistence program that Roosevelt and her friends imagined, but it did pave the way for larger New Deal initiatives during Franklin's presidential administration. Nancy's failing health and pressures from the Great Depression compelled the women to dissolve the partnership in 1938, at which time Roosevelt converted the shop buildings into a cottage at Val-Kill, that eventually became her permanent residence after Franklin died in 1945. Otto Berge acquired the contents of the factory {{and the use of the}} Val-Kill name to continue making colonial-style furniture until he retired in 1975. In 1977, Roosevelt's cottage at Val-Kill and its surrounding property of 181 acres (0.73 km2), was formally designated by an act of Congress as the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site, [...] "to commemorate for the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of an outstanding woman in American history." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a humorist, Storm P. {{is related}} to British and American humour, with a strong touch of craziness and absurdity.
