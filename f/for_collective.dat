5|$|Despite Australia's greater {{representation}} in London after 1923, Bruce's hope <b>for</b> <b>collective</b> imperial decision-making was dashed once {{more with the}} British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed with the decision ideologically and {{on the grounds that}} once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain's and her dominions' opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the General Treaty with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European security arrangements, Bruce had criticised Britain's signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was not binding on the dominions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Collectives are an {{important}} component of parallel programs, and {{have a significant impact on}} performance and scalability of an application. To obtain best performance, platform specific implementations of various parallel programming frameworks, such as MPI and Charm++, are done. As a result, when systems with new network topologies are built, new topology aware algorithms <b>for</b> <b>collectives</b> are added to these frameworks that also contain the topology oblivious algorithms. In this paper, we propose topology aware algorithms <b>for</b> <b>collectives</b> performed on two-tier direct networks such as IBM PERCS and Dragonfly. We observe that, for large message operations, significant performance gains can be made by taking advantage of large number of links in a twotier direct network. We evaluate proposed algorithms using an analytical model based on link utilization...|$|R
