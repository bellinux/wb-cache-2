40|$|The sequences, or primary structures, of {{existing}} biopolymers [...] in particular, proteins [...] {{are believed to}} be a product of evolution. Are the sequences random? If not, what is the character of this nonrandomness? To explore the statistics of protein sequences, we use the idea of mapping the sequence onto the trajectory of a random walk, originally proposed by Peng et al. [Peng, C. -K., Buldyrev, S. V., Goldberger, A. L., Havlin, S., Sciortino, F., Simons, M. & Stanley, H. E. (1992) Nature (London) 356, 168 - 170] in their analysis of DNA sequences.

40|$|SummaryClpX, a AAA+ ring homohexamer, {{uses the}} energy of ATP binding and {{hydrolysis}} to power conformational changes that unfold and translocate target proteins into the ClpP peptidase for degradation. In multiple crystal structures, some ClpX subunits adopt nucleotide-loadable conformations, others adopt unloadable conformations, and each conformational class exhibits substantial variability. Using mutagenesis of individual subunits in covalently tethered hexamers together with fluorescence methods to assay the conformations and nucleotide-binding properties of these subunits, we demonstrate that dynamic interconversion between loadable and unloadable conformations is required to couple ATP hydrolysis by ClpX to mechanical work. ATP binding to different classes of subunits initially <b>drives</b> <b>staged</b> allosteric changes, which set the conformation of the ring to allow hydrolysis and linked mechanical steps. Subunit switching between loadable and unloadable conformations subsequently isomerizes or resets {{the configuration of the}} nucleotide-loaded ring and is required for mechanical function...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} rise, deformation, deformation via {{room temperature}} {{change and the}} time of reaching heat balance of the motion table in precision linear motor <b>driven</b> <b>stage</b> made of steel, aluminum, alumina ceramic and silica ceramic are analyzed. The results show that the temperature rise of silica ceramic with small heat conductivity coefficient decreases clearly. Because of the small thermal expansion coefficient, the deformation of silica ceramic table is small. The thermal stress and deformation of silica ceramic table due to room temperature change are smaller than those of aluminum, steel and alumina ceramic tables. The heat conduction of silica ceramic is slow, so the time of reaching heat balance is long. As a result of the motion table being badly influenced by the primary section of the linear motor in precision linear motor stage, precision stage should choose the material with small heat conductivity coefficient, small thermal expansion coefficient and insensitive to temperature change.
