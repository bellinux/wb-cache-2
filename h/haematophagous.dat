50|$|The large {{variety of}} {{arthropods}} associated with sloths comprise two distinct feeding guilds - the <b>haematophagous</b> guild, represented by biting flies, mites, and ticks, and the coprophagous guild which comprises a unique assemblage of moths and beetles which utilize the sloth principally for phoresis and whose larval stages feed and {{develop in the}} dung of the host sloth.|$|E

Eventually she received the degree of Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of Malaria, thermoregulate {{each time}} they take a blood meal on a warm-blooded animal. During blood ingestion, they emit a droplet {{composed}} of urine and fresh blood that they keep attached to their anus. The liquid of the drop evaporates dissipating the excess of heat in their bodies consequence of the rapid ingestion or relatively high amounts of blood much warmer than the insect itself. This evaporative cooling mechanism helps them to avoid the thermal stress associated to their <b>haematophagous</b> way of life.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} blood suckers rather than predators, {{and they are}} {{accordingly}} far less welcome to humans. Triatoma species {{and other members of}} the subfamily Triatominae, such as Rhodnius species, Panstrongylus megistus, and Paratriatoma hirsuta, are known as kissing bugs, because they tend to bite sleeping humans in the soft tissue around the lips and eyes. A more serious problem than their bites is the fact that several of these <b>haematophagous</b> Central and South American species transmit the potentially fatal trypanosomal Chagas disease, sometimes called American trypanosomiasis.|$|E
5000|$|All triatomine nymph instars {{and adults}} are <b>haematophagous</b> and require the {{stability}} of a sheltered environment where they aggregate. Most species are associated with wild nesting vertebrates and are named [...] "sylvatic" [...] triatomines. These live in ground burrows with rodents or armadillos, or in tree-dwellings with bats, birds, sloths, or opossums. Few species (5%) live in human dwellings or in the surroundings of human houses (peridomicile) in the shelters of domestic animals, these are named [...] "domestic" [...] species.

50|$|Hepatozoon is a genus of Apicomplexa alveolates which {{incorporates}} over 300 species obligate intraerythrocytic parasites. Species {{have been}} described from all groups of tetrapod vertebrates, {{as well as a}} wide range of <b>haematophagous</b> arthropods, which serve as both the vectors and definitive hosts of the parasite. By far the most biodiverse and prevalent of all haemogregarines, the genus is distinguished by its unique reciprocal trophic lifecycle which lacks the salivary transmission between hosts commonly associated with other apicomplexans. While particularly prevalent in amphibians and reptiles, the genus is more well known in veterinary circles for causing a tick-borne disease called hepatozoonosis in some mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} Triatominae , a {{subfamily}} of Reduviidae, are {{also known as}} conenose bugs, kissing bugs, assassin bugs, or vampire bugs. Other local names for them used in the Latin Americas include barbeiros, vinchucas, pitos and chinches. Most of the 130 or more species of this subfamily are <b>haematophagous,</b> i.e. feeds on vertebrate blood; a very few species feed on other invertebrates (Sandoval et al. 2000, 2004). They are mainly found and widespread in the Americas, with a few species present in Asia, Africa, and Australia. These bugs usually share shelter with nesting vertebrates, from which they suck blood. In areas where Chagas disease occurs (from the southern United States to northern Argentina), all triatomine species are potential vectors of the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, but only those species (such as Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus) that are well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors. Proteins released from their bites {{have been known to}} induce anaphylaxis in sensitive and sensitized individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America [...] ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the <b>haematophagous</b> insect triatomine (descriptions [...] "assassin bug", [...] "cone-nose bug", and [...] "kissing bug") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.|$|E
50|$|Gnathia pilosus is {{the eighth}} gnathiid species to be {{described}} from South Africa. It occurs on the warmer east coast {{compared to the other}} seven gnathiids found on the colder west and south coasts of South Africa. Gnathiids have a polymorphic and biphasic life cycle (reproductive stage and ectoparasite larval stage). There are three larval stages with each stage having two forms, namely praniza and zuphea. The praniza is usually a replete, <b>haematophagous</b> phase while the zuphea is an unfed benthic dweller phase. Adults can be found in groups with a single male and up to 43 females and immature specimens. The free-living adults do not feed and are usually hidden in a cavity or sponge where reproduction will occur. The larvae of gnathiid isopods are known to parasitise a large variety of intertidal fish worldwide. The taxonomic classification of gnathiids is usually based on the morphological characteristics of the adult male. The detailed descriptions of the female and larva, however, are also important for identifying these life stages to species level when collected in the absence of males.|$|E

The first record of an {{introduction of}} anadromous P. marinus into a reservoir in Europe (Portodemouros, NW Spain) is described. Data suggest that this landlocked population was not successful and did not settle in the area because the <b>haematophagous</b> feeding phase was not viable.

Among the molecules related to the blood-feeding habit, proteases play an essential role. In this review, we provide a panorama of proteases from arthropod vectors involved in haematophagy, in digestion, in egg development and in immunity.

40|$|The common bed bug Cimex lectularius (Hemiptera; Cimicidae) is a {{temporary}} ectoparasite on humans that is currently reinvading the developed countries.

In this study, we reconfirmed {{the distribution of the}} 44 olfactory sensilla and identified 3 different sensillum types located at the distal tip of C. lectularius antenna by external morphology mapping. Using a panel of relevant odorants previously reported to be bioactive in various <b>haematophagous</b> arthropods, we correlated the morphological mapping with an electrophysiological characterization of the olfactory receptor neurons housed in each specific sensillum.

40|$|We {{developed}} a DNA assay for bloodmeal identification in <b>haematophagous</b> insects. Specific host cytochrome B gene sequences were amplified by PCR and classified {{on the basis}} of their mobility in a heteroduplex assay.

40|$|To {{efficiently}} blood feed, insects {{have evolved}} a salivary concoction that disarms their host's haemostasis, a redundant physiological mechanism that includes blood clotting, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Because vertebrate haemostasis {{is complex and}} redundant, <b>haematophagous</b> insect saliva is also complex and redundant, containing dozens of active compounds. Because this feeding mode evolved independently in several insect orders, the salivary composition among insects of different orders is very diverse, typical of a convergent evolutionary scenario.

40|$|SummaryWith {{nearly one}} quarter of {{mammalian}} species threatened, an accurate description of their distribution and conservation status is needed [1]. For rare, shy or cryptic species, existing monitoring methods are often prohibitively expensive or unreliable. The problem is particularly acute in tropical forests, where {{a disproportionate number of}} species are listed by IUCN as ‘data deficient’ [2], due to the difficulty of monitoring with conventional approaches. This presents serious obstacles to conservation management. We, here, describe a new screening tool, the analysis of mammalian DNA extracted from <b>haematophagous</b> leeches. By demonstrating that PCR amplifiable mammalian blood DNA survives for at least four months post feeding in <b>haematophagous</b> Hirudo spp. leeches, we hypothesise that most wild caught adult leeches will contain DNA traces of their last blood meal. We subsequently demonstrate the efficacy of the method, by testing it in situ using terrestrial Haemadipsa spp. leeches caught in a tropical Vietnamese rainforest setting, and identify cryptic, rare and newly discovered mammalian species. We propose that DNA from leeches represents a quick, cost-effective and standardised way to obtain basic data on mammalian biodiversity and species occupancy, facilitating efficient use of limited conservation resources...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} largely {{accepted}} that the cognitive abilities of disease vector insects may have drastic consequences on parasite transmission. However, despite the research effort that has been invested {{in the study of}} learning and memory in <b>haematophagous</b> insects, hitherto few conclusive results have been obtained. Adapting procedures largely validated in Drosophila, honeybees and butterflies, we demonstrate here that the proboscis extension response (PER) of the <b>haematophagous</b> insect Rhodnius prolixus can be modulated by non-associative (habituation) and associative (aversive conditioning) learning forms. Thermal stimuli were used as both unconditional stimulus (appetitive temperatures) and negative reinforcement (thermal shock). In {{the first part of this}} work, the PER was habituated and dishabituated to thermal stimuli, demonstrating the true central processing of information and discarding motor fatigue or sensory adaptation. Habituation was revealed to be modulated by the spatial context. In the second part, bugs that were submitted to aversive operant conditioning stopped responding with PER to thermal stimulation more quickly than by habituation. They were able to use their training experience when tested up to 72 h later. Our work constitutes the first demonstration of PER habituation and conditioning in a blood-sucking insect and provides reproducible experimental tools for the study of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory in disease vectors...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{identify}} the main vector and possible transmission routes of Anaplasma spp. in a region of Hungary with high prevalence of ovine and bovine anaplasmosis, DNA was extracted from 316 <b>haematophagous</b> arthropods (individually or in pools), including 4 species of ixodid ticks, 6 species of tabanid flies and hornflies. Midichloria-like organisms were identified with PCR (amplifying {{a portion of the}} 16 S rRNA gene) and sequencing from Dermacentor marginatus and Ixodes ricinus. Significantly higher 16 S positive D. marginatus individuals were collected in March than in April, suggesting earlier questing of ticks that contain rickettsial agents (thus endosymbionts). Midichloria- and Wolbachia-like organisms were also found in randomly caught horse flies (Tabanus bovinus and T. tergestinus) as well as hornflies (Haematobia irritans), respectively, with 97 - 99 % similarity to sequences deposited in the GenBank. Although all ticks were negative in the Anaplasma spp. -specific msp 4 PCR, four individuals of T bovinus collected near to gazing cattle were positive for Anaplasma marginale.
