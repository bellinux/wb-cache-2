40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} legal {{regulation}} of lands affected by mining activities. These activities, predominantly {{the extraction of}} minerals are by their nature very closely related to soil and land. The thesis offers a comprehensive view of the legal relations {{in the process of}} mining - from prospecting and <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> mineral <b>deposits</b> to mine closure - while it discusses the key issues {{from the perspective of the}} land owner as well as the mining companies. Legal relations arising from mining activities are significantly influenced by the character of mining. Mining interferes with rights and interests related to land and ownership of land which gives rise to certain conflicts. Mining companies' interests come very often into conflict with interests of the owner of the land where the mineral deposit is located. The legal relations are further complicated by the position of the state who acts as an owner of mineral wealth and an authority defending public interests. The introductory chapter of the thesis defines the terms that are essential for the selected topic. The content of the next chapters corresponds with phases of mining activities as they are carried out in reality. Prospecting and <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> exclusive <b>deposits</b> represents the first phase of mining activity. In the chapter [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The {{magnetic}} method detects anomalies of magnetization inherent to mineral assemblages, {{which have been}} widely used for exploring hydrothermal systems. The most successful magnetic survey related to <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> hydrothermal <b>deposits</b> was that conducted by Tivey and Johnson (2002), who found circular low-magnetization areas that coincided with the location of active and extinct hydrothermal sites near the Juan de Fuca Ridge axis. These magnetic lows are putatively attributed to the alteration of magnetized minerals into non-magnetized minerals rather than to thermal demagnetization because extinct systems show low magnetization (Tivey and Johnson 2002). However, the detected signals are generally not linked immediately to the presence <b>of</b> the ore <b>deposits</b> because the degree of magnetization depends on the mineral assemblage.|$|R
50|$|The Dun Glen Placer Mine is {{situated}} in Pershing County, Nevada, along Dun Glen Creek, which drains from {{the west side of}} the East Range Mountains. Reports indicate lode gold was discovered and vein deposits were mined in Dun Glen Canyon during the early 1860s. Chinese miners attempted drift mining of the gold laden placer gravels between 1880 and 1890 with limited success due to the water table. Further <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deposits</b> in the 1920s to 1930’s led to the first mechanized placer operation in 1931. The area has been mined for placer gold since that time and various production totals have been poorly documented.|$|R

30|$|Self-potential method obviates {{complicated}} data analysis, {{making it}} ideal for the efficient <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> ore <b>deposits.</b> In fact, it requires no detailed geological information for interpretation. This benefit {{reflects the fact}} that the self-potential signals are linked directly to physicochemical processes that are inherent to ore deposits. The geo-battery is the most plausible mechanism for self-potential signals emerging near ore bodies (Sato and Mooney 1960): an electrically conductive body (an ore deposit) in the presence of subsurface redox gradient produces a negative self-potential anomaly above it. The geo-battery mechanism is not expected to work near less-conductive volcanic bodies. An earlier report described that no self-potential anomaly was actually observed above volcanic bodies (Kawada and Kasaya 2017). This behavior prevents unnecessary explorations conducted for an earlier study (e.g., Kato et al. 1989).|$|R

Another idea in this field is carrying out survey using various techniques and working out jointly the sur-vey results on-board. Such a method allows improving accuracy of positioning.

Characteristically for barracudas, the teeth are labiolingually flattened and fang-like with a broadly triangular and blade-like acuminate outline and sharply edged but unserrated cutting margins. These barracudas inhabited an environment that included coral reefs (based on fossil scleractinians) and seagrass beds (evidenced by the epiphytic benthic foraminifera Elphidium sp.). The relatively common occurrence of Miocene barracuda at Nosy Makamby corroborates the presence of a tropical marine ecosystem encircling Madagascar by the Miocene, likely similar overall to the environment found there today...|$|R
