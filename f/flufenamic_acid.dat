Antagonism of NMDA-mediated currents by chlo-ride transport blockers was voltage independent and showed fast on-off kinetics. The action was noncompetitive with NMDA and did not arise from interaction with the Zn 2 inhibitory site, because blockade of NMDA-induced responses by furosemide and Zn 2 was additive.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{conformational analysis}} of fenamates, which are N-arylated derivatives of anthranilic acid or 2 -aminonicotinic acid with different substituents on the aryl (phenyl) group, is reported. The {{analysis of these}} analgesics, which are believed to act through the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, was carried out using semi-empirical potential functions. The results and available crystallographic observations have been critically examined {{in terms of their}} relevance to drug action. Crystallographic studies of these drugs and their complexes have revealed that the fenamate molecules share a striking invariant feature, namely, the sixmembered ring bearing the carboxyl group is coplanar with the carboxyl group and the bridging imino group,the coplanarity being stabilized by resonance interactions and an internal hydrogen bond between the imino and carboxyl groups. The results of the theoretical analysis provide a conformational rationale for the observed invariant coplanarity. The second sixmembered ring, which provides hydrophobicity in a substantial part of the molecule, has limited conformational flexibility in meclofenamic, mefenamic and <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acids.</b> Comparison of the conformational energy maps of these acids shows that they could all assume the same conformation when bound to the relevant enzyme. The present study provides a structural explanation for the difference in the activity of niflumic acid, which can assume a conformation in which the whole molecule is nearly planar. The main role of the carboxyl group appears to be to provide a site for intermolecular interactions in addition to helping in stabilizing the invariant coplanar feature and providing hydrophilicity {{at one end of the}} molecule. The fenamates thus provide a good example of conformation- dependent molecular asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) induce apoptosis in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines. Similar {{actions on}} normal gastric epithelial cells {{could contribute to}} NSAID gastropathy. The present work therefore compared the actions of diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the cyclo-oxygenase- 2 selective inhibitor, NS- 398, on a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells. Cell number was assessed by staining with crystal violet. Apoptotic activity was determined by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and by assay of caspase- 3 -like activity. Necrosis was evaluated from release of cellular enzymes. Ibuprofen (250 [*]μM for 24 [*]h) promoted cell loss, and apoptosis, under both basal conditions and when apoptosis was increased by 25 [*]μM N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C 6 -ceramide). Diclofenac (250 [*]μM for 24 [*]h) reduced the proportion of apoptotic nuclei from 5. 2 to 2. 1 %, and caused inhibition of caspase- 3 -like activity, without causing necrosis under basal conditions. No such reduction in apoptotic activity {{was evident in the}} presence of 25 [*]μM C 6 -ceramide. The inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal caspase- 3 -like activity was also exhibited by the structurally similar mefenamic and <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acids</b> (1 – 250 [*]μM), but not by niflumic acid. Inhibition of superoxide production by the cells increased caspase- 3 -like activity, but the inhibitory action of diclofenac on caspase activity remained. Diclofenac did not affect superoxide production. Diclofenac inhibited caspase- 3 -like activity in cell homogenates and also inhibited human recombinant caspase- 3. In conclusion, NSAIDs vary in their effect on apoptotic activity in a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells, and the inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal apoptosis could involve an action on caspase activity...|$|R

Model drugs were (1) <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and (2) mefenamic acid. ^ A structurally related compound, mefenamic acid, stabilizes the metastable form of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> against solid state polymorphic transformation. It was shown that mefenamic acid attached on the (100) face of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> crystals or was incorporated into <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> crystals. Stabilization could be achieved by inhibiting nucleation of the new phase and by decreasing the difference in free energy between two polymorphs. ^ In sublimation study, it was shown that mefenamic acid Form I crystals grew on the (100) faces of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> Form I and Form III with different affinity and orientations. Differences in affinity and orientations {{can be explained by}} comparing lattice matching pattern, hydrogen bonding patterns and conformational similarities of mefenamic acid to those of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> polymorphs. ^ Solubility study of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and mefenamic acid was conducted with solvent having different polarity. From this study, it was shown that (a) the behaviors between <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and mefenamic acid were similar in solvent with high polarity but different in solvents with low polarity and that (b) the solubility of mefenamic acid could be increased as many as seven times in some solvents when <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is present.

The inhibition of the system was assessed by measurement of the taurine chlorination while the accumulation of compound II was used to investigate the mechanism of inhibition. The oxidation products of NSAIDs by the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system were identified and <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and derivatives were also assessed in the inhibition of LDL oxidation in two models. <b>Flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (IC(50) = 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 microM) is the most efficient inhibitor of the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system and nimesulide (IC(50) = 2. 1 +/- 0. 3 microM) is more active than the other NSAIDs of the oxicam family (IC(50) = 8 - 12 microM). The accumulation of compound II revealed that <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> acts as an electron donor while the other NSAIDs are antagonists of chloride anions.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} article, we {{have studied the}} {{photochemical}} behavior of a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) namely <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (FLUA) in aqueous solution. The absorption spectrum of such compound shows a significant absorption beyond 290 nm and the photochemical irradiation within the range 300 – 450 nm leads to its complete transformation in roughly 6 h. The quantum yield of FLUA transformation measured at 290 and 310 nm was evaluated to about 1. 1 × 10 − 4 without any significant effect of the excitation wavelength. The degradation process was inhibited in acidic solutions owing to the sharp increment in the absorption of FLUA in the wavelength region between 300 and 350 nm. The quantum yield was estimated to 1. 2 × 10 − 4 at pH 7. The effect of oxygen on the photochemical behavior of FLUA has also been investigated. The obtained results clearly indicate that oxygen is not significantly involved in the photochemical degradation process. The phototransformation of the <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> appears to occur through one pathway that involves the photohydrolysis of trifluoromethyl group, and thus leads {{to the formation of}} one specific photoproduct, namely 2, 3 ′-imino-dibenzoic acid.

40|$|Background—Flufenamic acid, a fenamate, {{has been}} shown to alter {{markedly}} the membrane potential of small intestinal smooth muscle and increase intracellular calcium in single cells.  Aims—To determine the effects of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> on myoelectrical motor activity and gastrointestinal transit in the intact animal.  Methods—Myoelectrical motor activity was recorded via seromuscular platinum electrodes sutured at regular intervals in the stomach and throughout the small intestine. Fasted and fed gastrointestinal transit was assessed using technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) as the radioactive marker linked to 1 mm amberlite pellets or added to the meal.  Results—Flufenamic acid (600 mg, intravenously) induced intense spike activity in the small intestine. The mean duration of irregular spike activity was 250 (7) minutes. Spike activity was more pronounced in the lower small intestine. <b>Flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> also accelerated initial gastric emptying and markedly shortened transit time in the small intestine. In the fasted state the 50 % transit time in the small intestine was 54 (8) minutes with infusion of <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with 105 (10) minutes in the control group; in the fed state 99 mTc first reached the colon at 220 (10) minutes compared with 270 (12) minutes in the control group.  Conclusions—Flufenamic acid had marked effects on both myoelectrical motor complex activity and small intestinal transit in the dog.

40|$|In {{familial}} amyloidotic polyneuropathy, TTR (transthyretin) variants are deposited as amyloid fibrils. It {{is thought}} that this process involves TTR tetramer dissociation, which leads to partially unfolded monomers that aggregate and polymerize into amyloid fibrils. This process can be counteracted by stabilization of the tetramer. Several small compounds, such as diclofenac, diflunisal and <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{have been reported to}} bind to TTR in vitro, in the T 4 (thyroxine) binding channel that runs through the TTR tetramer, and consequently are considered to stabilize TTR. However, if these agents bind plasma proteins other than TTR, decreased drug availability will occur, compromising their use as therapeutic agents for TTR amyloidosis. In the present work, we compared the action of these compounds and of new derivatives designed to increase both selectivity of binding to TTR and inhibitory potency in relation to TTR amyloid fibril formation. We found two diflunisal derivatives that, in contrast with diclofenac, <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and diflunisal, displaced T 4 from TTR in plasma preferentially over binding to albumin and thyroxine binding globulin. The same diflunisal derivatives also had a stabilizing effect on TTR tetramers in plasma, as studied by isoelectric focusing of whole plasma under semi-denaturing conditions. In addition, by transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that, in contrast with other proposed TTR stabilizers (namely diclofenac, <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and diflunisal), one of the diflunisal derivatives tested efficiently inhibited TTR aggregation.

We used whole-cell and nucleated patch recordings to investigate the mechanisms of FFA modulation of TTX-sensitive voltage-gated sodium current. Our data show that <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> slows down the inactivation process of the sodium current, while shifting the inactivation curve ∼ 10 mV toward more hyperpolarized potentials. The recovery from inactivation is also affected in a voltage-dependent way, resulting in slower recovery at hyperpolarized potentials. Recordings from acute slices demonstrate that FFA reduces repetitive- and abolishes burst-firing in CA 1 pyramidal neurons. A computational model based on our data was employed {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of FFA action. Simulation data support the idea that FFA acts via a novel mechanism by reducing the voltage dependence of the sodium channel fast inactivation rates. These effects of FFA suggest that it may be an effective anti-epileptic drug...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} two inhibitors of DNA synthesis, hydroxyurea (HU) and aphidicholin (APC), and two inhibitors of prostaglandin cyclooxygenase, indomethacin and <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{for their}} ef-fects on the resorptive responses of fetal rat long-bone cul-tures to {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) and parathyroid hor-mone (PTH). As we have previously found, HU decreased unstimulated 4 'Ca release but {{had little effect on}} the resorptive response to PTH. HU also did not block resorption stimulated by EGF. Addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, did not alter the resorptive responses of unstimulated or PTH-treated cultures in either the presence or absence ofHU or the resorptive response of bones cultured with EGF alone. However, indo-methacin completely blocked the resorptive response to EGF of bones that were cultured with HU. The effects of indomethacin on EGF-mediated resorption in HU-treated cultures appeared to be related to an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis since <b>flufenamic</b> <b>acid</b> had similar effects. However, the effects ofHU on the resorptive response to EGF may not have resulted solely from its inhibitory action on DNA synthesis since APC, in the absence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, completely blocked EGF-mediated resorption without significantly affecting the response to PTH. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms regulating PTH- and EGF-mediated resorption in fetal rat long-bone cul-tures differ, and imply that a component of EGF-mediated re-sorption in these cultures is dependent on sustained DNA syn-thesis...|$|E
