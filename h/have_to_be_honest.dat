Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E

While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to.

500|$|On 29 June 1958, Pelé {{became the}} {{youngest}} player {{to play in a}} World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E

I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest,</b> we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> with her.|$|E
2500|$|Detroit manager Sparky Anderson is fifth on {{the all-time}} list for manager career wins in Major League Baseball, and in 1984 {{he became the first}} manager to win the World Series while leading clubs in both leagues. He {{previously}} managed the Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, but the Reds inexplicably fired him after a second-place finish in the 1978 season.

The chorus states her frustration with men not completing everyday housekeeping tasks; [...] "Does he wash up? Never wash up/Does he clean up? No he never cleans up/Does he brush up? He never brushed up". In the final verse the lyrics state, [...] "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest,</b> I do {{like a man who}} can dance, but it's not a deal-breaker.

3000|$|A {{search of}} the {{literature}} reveals {{that there is no}} consensus on the best treatment for multiple exostoses, with recommended treatments ranging from the simple resection of an exostosis of the distal ulna to a complex lengthening of the ulna associated with a distal radius osteotomy, an ulnar exostosis resection, and an annular ligament reconstruction. This profusion of published treatments indicates a serious lack of informed knowledge on the best manner to treat this condition. Consequently, the treating physician <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> with the patient and the family with respect to the attainable results of the surgery [1]. We believe that [...] the resection of the distal ulnar exostosis will likely improve the pronation and the supination and that the lengthening of the ulna will most certainly improve the ulnar deviation of the wrist. However, the result of such surgery on the pronation and supination motion is not truly predictable.|$|R
50|$|Reeves {{pointed out}} that <b>to</b> work, {{advertising}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest.</b> He insisted the product being sold actually be superior, and argued {{that no amount of}} advertising could move inferior goods. He also disagreed that advertising <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> create demand where it did not exist. Successful advertising for a flawed product would only increase {{the number of people who}} tried the product and became dissatisfied with it. If advertising is effective enough and a product flawed enough, the advertising will accelerate the destruction of the brand. Similarly, Reeves believed it was a waste of money to claim uniqueness that doesn't exist, because consumers will soon find out, and they won't come back to the brand. This is important because historically fortunes are made from repeat business. Money would be better spent building some kind of meaningful advantage into a product before launching a costly advertising campaign to promote it.|$|R

It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the effects of {{reputational}} incentives in the building of cooperative behaviors between contracting partners. We show that bilateral reputation between two partners could act as a way to enhance cooperation. More precisely, our model, based on the framework of Tirole [2008], shows how contracting costs decrease over time thanks to the growing trust given to the contractual partner that <b>has</b> proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> in past transactions. Such a trust leads to increase the degree of contractual incompleteness over time if contracts are renewed, since parties rely much more on informal agreements. By this way, we took another path than recent contributions in relational contracting which only focus on the valorization of future business. In our view, informal practices characterizing relational contracts depend both on future transactions and past experiences. We also propose an empirical assessment of relational contracting and the impact of reputational concern in the dynamics of cooperation by using experimental economics...|$|R
