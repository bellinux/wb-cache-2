50|$|A <b>day-fine</b> {{is a fine}} that, above a minimum, {{is based}} on {{personal}} income.|$|E
50|$|Jurisdictions {{employing}} the <b>day-fine</b> include Finland (päiväsakko), Sweden (dagsbot), Denmark (dagbøde), Croatia, Germany (Tagessatz), Switzerland, and Macao.|$|E
50|$|A Finnish fine {{consists}} of a minimum of 1 <b>day-fine,</b> up {{to a maximum of}} 120 day-fines. If several crimes are punished together, 240 day-fines may be sentenced. The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence, unless the prison sentence is probational. The minimum amount of a <b>day-fine</b> is 6 euros. Usually, the <b>day-fine</b> is one half of daily disposable income. The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the person's monthly mean income during the year, after taxes, social security payments and a basic living allowance of €255 per month have been deducted. In addition, every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by €3. The income of the person is calculated {{on the basis of the}} latest taxation data. For speeding in traffic, however, the fine is at least as high as the petty fine, i.e. €115.|$|E
5000|$|Since 2008, the non-payment of <b>day-fines</b> is {{no longer}} {{convertible}} to a prison term.|$|R
50|$|In September 2009, Vähäkainu {{was convicted}} of aggravated driving under the influence. He {{received}} a suspended sentence of 45 days and was <b>day-fined.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 18 October 2011, {{the man who}} {{invaded the}} pitch was sentenced by the Malmö District Court to 120 <b>day-fines</b> {{for a total of}} 10,000 SEK, not only for invading the pitch but also for {{throwing}} the firecracker.|$|R
50|$|A <b>day-fine,</b> day fine, {{unit fine}} or {{structured}} fine is {{a unit of}} fine payment that, above a minimum fine, {{is based on the}} offender's daily personal income. A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial punishment, in the effect of preventing work, a <b>day-fine</b> represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with income tax, which is also proportional to the income, even progressively.|$|E
5000|$|Article 45 of the Penal Code ( [...] , Portuguese: [...] ) {{specifies}} that {{a criminal}} fine ( [...] , Portuguese: [...] ) shall normally {{be at least}} 10 days and at most 360 days. One <b>day-fine</b> costs at least 50 Macanese patacas and at most 10,000 patacas. A court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of a convict.|$|E
50|$|In Finland, the <b>day-fine</b> {{system is}} used for most crimes that are {{punishable}} {{by way of a}} fine. The system has been in use since 1921. Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine (rikesakko, ordningsbot) such as minor traffic and water traffic violations,littering, and breaches of public peace.A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt, but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{an elderly}} man had his camera confiscated and was fined 12 <b>day-fines</b> for the act of public {{obscenity}} (which {{was thought to be}} the closest match in the criminal code), having taken dozens of upskirt photos in a shopping centre in Turku.|$|R
50|$|Vähäkainu was {{investigated}} {{due to his}} alleged involvement of arranging a meeting between a cocaine dealer and potential customers in October 2009, while still on probation. A text message sent by him to the dealer was presented as an evidence in court. He denied any such involvement. On March 30, 2010 Vähäkainu was convicted of distributing ten grams of cocaine and sentenced to pay 80 <b>day-fines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 2001, the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf {{was visiting}} Varberg {{when he was}} pied by a 16-year-old boy. Such an attack could {{possibly}} have counted as high treason under Swedish law, which would have warranted a long prison sentence. However, the perpetrator was only convicted of assault, as {{it could not be}} proven that his action was politically motivated. He was later ordered to pay <b>day-fines.</b> Two other boys, who had helped to prepare the attack by making the cake, were also fined.|$|R
50|$|The {{person who}} is punished with a fine is {{responsible}} for giving accurate information concerning their income. Lying about one's income (sakkovilppi, bötesfusk) is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison. The police can, however, access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a real-time datalink, so the chance of lying successfully is minor. There is no maximum <b>day-fine,</b> which may lead to considerably high fines for high-income persons. For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting €26,000, for driving though a red traffic light. In 2009 a businessman was fined €112,000 for travelling at 82 kilometres per hour in an area with a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour. As speeding is punished with a petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to 20 km/h, but with a <b>day-fine</b> if exceeding the limit by 21 km/h or more, the monetary amount of the fine can increase from €115 to over €100,000 although the actual change in speed is less than 1 km/h. This {{has given rise to}} some criticism, most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament, avid motorist Klaus Bremer and other MPs of right-wing parties.|$|E
50|$|If the {{military}} person {{is no longer}} in service, the summary disciplinary procedure cannot be used and {{the military}} has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue. In such cases, the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members. In sentencing, disciplinary punishments cannot be used. Instead if a disciplinary punishment, an ordinary <b>day-fine</b> is sentenced. Typically, this is the case when a reservist is absent from an obligatory refresher exercise or a conscript is, after the commission of crime, declared unfit for duty for medical or security reasons.|$|E
50|$|Most infractions are {{punishable}} with a <b>day-fine.</b> For crimes warranting no {{more than}} six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court. If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a quorum with a single member. The fine is paid to the bank using a giro. A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any European Union member country.|$|E
5000|$|A Finnish {{member of}} EU {{parliament}} Jussi Halla-aho was sentenced for both blasphemy and hate speech in 2012 by the Supreme Court after saying that [...] "Islam is a paedophilia religion" [...] and [...] "it's a national {{and possibly even}} genetic special characteristic of the Somali people to rob passers-by and to be parasites living on the tax-payers' money". According to Jussi Halla-aho himself, the latter was meant to criticize the fact that saying that Finns drink a lot and then kill people due to possibly genetic reasons was held to be in accordance of the ethics of the press by the self-regulatory organ of the mass-media. Fines are income-based in Finland. Halla-aho was sentenced to 50 <b>day-fines</b> and had to pay €550 based on his income.|$|R
50|$|The {{criminal}} procedure regarding personal use of illegal narcotics was reformed in 2001. The {{goal of the}} change was to relieve burden of personal use cases from the courts, expedite enforcement and standardise enforcement policies - specifically by stopping cases from not being prosecuted {{due to lack of}} resources. In the reformed procedure the police issue summary fines for most personal use offences, and cases are not brought to court unless the defendant so desires. Aggravated drug offences and possession with intent to redistribute (possession for sale) are always brought to court and penalties are harsher. In practice, possession of up to 10 grams of hashish or 15 grams of marijuana is deemed personal use and carries a penalty of 10-20 <b>day-fines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} anthem in the Macau Special Administrative Region is {{particularly}} governed by Law №5/1999, which was enacted on 20 December 1999. Article 7 of the law requires that the anthem be accurately performed pursuant to the sheet music in its Appendix 4 and prohibits the lyrics from being altered. Under Article 9, willful alteration of the music or lyrics is criminally punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years or up to 360 <b>day-fines</b> and, although both Chinese and Portuguese are official languages of the region, the provided sheet music has its lyrics only in Chinese. There are no analogous laws in mainland China or in Hong Kong, where an English translation of the anthem is used for important events at the University of Hong Kong.|$|R

40|$|Important {{changes in}} the legal {{regulation}} of the fine culminated {{in the implementation of}} the <b>day-fine</b> system in many European countries during the twentieth century.

5000|$|... 1. The Allsvenskan {{match between}} Malmö FF and Helsingborg, played at Swedbank Stadion on 24 May, was {{suspended}} in the 30th match minute after two spectator related incidents. After Rachid Bouaouzan had opened up the score for Helsingborg a spectator from Malmö FF's standing section threw a firecracker popularly called [...] "bangers" [...] onto the pitch and close to Helsingborg keeper Pär Hansson. The result of the [...] "banger" [...] was that Hansson displayed visually and verbally {{the fact that he}} had been hurt and was suffering some kind of ringing in his right ear. Simultaneously a supporter from the same section jumped over the gates restricting access to the pitch and started walking towards Hansson. The man managed to give Hansson a push before being tackled to the ground by Helsingborg player Peter Larsson. The referee Stefan Johannesson ordered all players and club staff of the pitch and adjoining areas as the police carried the attacker off the pitch and into custody. After a twenty-minute wait the speaker announced that the referee had taken the decision to abandon the match and evacuate the spectators from the ground. On 17 June 2011 the Swedish Football Association reached a decision on the outcome of the game. Helsingborg were awarded the game 3-0 although being fined 25 000 SEK, Malmö FF were fined 150 000 SEK as well as the introduction of a net in front of the standing section at Swedbank Stadion. On 18 October 2011, the man who invaded the pitch was sentenced to 120 <b>day-fines,</b> not only for invading the pitch but also for throwing the firecracker. Both Malmö FF and Canal + are planning to sue the man for causing financial damages.|$|R
