5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{digitizing}} images on scanners, {{and the concept}} of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of <b>discrete</b> <b>sensor</b> elements. Early spy satellites used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters. Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground. The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film. The first electronic imaging satellite was the KH-11 launched by the NRO in late 1976. It had a charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a resolution of 800 x 800 pixels (0.64 megapixels). [...] At Philips Labs in New York, Edward Stupp, Pieter Cath and Zsolt Szilagyi filed for a patent on [...] "All Solid State Radiation Imagers" [...] on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970. [...] Texas Instruments engineer Willis Adcock designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built. The Cromemco CYCLOPS introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975 was the first digital camera to be interfaced to a microcomputer.|$|E

In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the types}} of errors that are introduced when using the Euler characteristic integral approach to count the number of targets in a <b>discrete</b> <b>sensor</b> field. In contrast to other theoretical analyses, this paper examines <b>discrete</b> <b>sensor</b> fields rather than continuous ones. The probabilities of first and second order errors are worked out combinatorially, and a general formula is found which is discovered to be proportional to much higher order errors. Asymptotic results are also derived. Thus, this work gives us the bias of the Euler characteristic integral as a point estimator for the number of targets in a sensor field, and a general understanding of how the Euler characteristic integral fails, or more often succeeds. 1...|$|E

In this paper, we present a method of learning inter-event timing relationships using observations from a correctly operating system. The observed sample statistics characteristic of correct system operation are used to create a confidence space of possible timing relationships (acceptable delay intervals) of the underlying system. Given a relative cost of false alarms vs. missed detections, the timing relationships can be chosen to minimize the worst case total of the false alarm and missed detection costs over the confidence space. 1.

MR is an advantageous bio-sensor readout because it can be determined from opaque samples and through intervening layers of matter. Wash steps can therefore be avoided in in vitro MR assays and non-invasive interrogation achieved for in vivo MR sensing. Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles originally developed as in vivo contrast agents have recently been adapted for use in magnetic relaxometry assays.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design {{inertial}} sensor based activity recognition for a low power continuous sensing architecture for today's mobile technology using a dedicated low-power sensor processor. The system framework {{is designed to provide}} higher level access to sensors and run sensor based algorithms. The sensor processor can provide consistently low latencies for feedback and interaction and continuous low power sensing for context adaptive user interfaces. In {{the current state of the}} art of hand-helds, every sensor is interfaced to the host processor directly and all the sensory data preprocessing and event detection is performed at the expense of the host processor. A dedicated sensor processor with good system architecture would improve the power and processing efficiency. The objective of the thesis is to interface all inertial sensors to a low-power <b>discrete</b> <b>sensor</b> hub where this low power <b>discrete</b> <b>sensor</b> hub implements most of the sensor pre-processing and algorithm. This sensor hub is directly interfaced via Bluetooth link to the host processor which is an Android mobile device. The sensor firmware architecture is event driven and reduces the power consumption without the need for polling the sensors. Host processor sends control messages to the sensor box and the device when replies back to the control messages also produces sensor data so most of the traffic is from the sensor hub to the host. Activity context detects user actions such as stand-still, walking, running, cycling, vehicle and sports. The activity context module uses naive bayesian classifier algorithm to classify the accelerometer sensor data and this module is implemented in the sensor box which has an ARM based microcontroller.

40|$|In most {{existing}} {{motion control}} algorithms, a reference trajectory is tracked, {{based on a}} continuous measurement of the system's response. In many industrial applications, however, it is either not possible or too expensive to install sensors which measure the system's output over the complete stroke: instead, the motion can only be detected at certain discrete positions. The control objective in these systems is often not to track a complete trajectory accurately, but rather to achieve a given state at the sensor locations (e. g. to pass by the sensor at a given time, or with a given speed).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} the vector control schemes for a variable-speed 131 kW PMSM (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) in super-high speed application. The vector control with synchronous reference frame current regulator has been implemented with the challenging requirements such as the extremely low stator inductance (28 H), the high dc link voltage(600 V) and the high excitation frequency(1. 2 kHz). Because the conventional position sensor is not reliable in super-high speed, two different schemes have been proposed to measure the position of the rotor. As a first step, a vector control with three <b>discrete</b> hall <b>sensors</b> is proposed. Because the <b>discrete</b> hall <b>sensors</b> give the rough position information with the resolution of 30, a position estimation algorithm is proposed to derive a precise position. And then a vector control scheme without any position sensor has been proposed. The proposed sensorless algorithm is implemented by processing the output voltage of the PI current regulator, and hence the structure is simple and the estimated speed is robust to the measurement noise.
