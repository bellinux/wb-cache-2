500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title and}} Homer's attire are {{references}} to Colonel Tom Parker, singer Elvis Presley's manager. Films {{playing at the}} Springfield Googolplex movie theater {{at the beginning of}} the episode include Honey, <b>I</b> <b>Hit</b> <b>a</b> School Bus (a parody of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids), Look Who's Oinking (a parody of Look Who's Talking), and a film called Ernest vs. The Pope which stars the fictional character Ernest P. Worrell. During his long drive to the Beer 'N' Brawl, Homer passes a boy playing a banjo on a porch, a reference to the [...] "Dueling Banjos" [...] sequence in the film Deliverance. The same boy appears later at the recording studio waiting in line with his banjo to record a CD. William Irwin writes in his book Philosophy and the Interpretation of Pop Culture that this [...] "burst of banjo" [...] must convey a message even if the viewers do not [...] "get" [...] the reference to Deliverance: [...] "Thanks to prevailing connotations of banjo music, viewers who do not recognize the banjo tune as the theme from Deliverance will not laugh, but the mere sound of banjo tells the audience that Homer has entered a backward, redneck area." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band went on hiatus from 2000 to 2003, with Claypool later stating: [...] "The {{end of the}} Nineties was {{an unhappy}} Primus camp. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> {{creative}} stagnation that wasn't helping us forward, and the personal elements, it just was time to stop.

[...] And it just wasn't fun anymore on many different levels." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not clear}} how Mays became known as the [...] "Say Hey Kid." [...] One story is that in 1951, Barney Kremenko, a writer for the New York Journal, {{proceeded}} to refer to Mays as the 'Say Hey Kid' after he overheard Mays say, [...] "'Say who,' 'Say what,' 'Say where,' 'Say hey'". Another story is that Jimmy Cannon created the nickname because Mays did not know everybody's names when he first arrived in the minors. [...] "You see a guy, you say, 'Hey, man. Say hey, man,'" [...] Mays said. [...] "Ted [...] was the 'Splinter'. Joe [...] was 'Joltin' Joe'. Stan [...] was 'The Man'.

2500|$|In {{the next}} major at the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah Country Club, Faldo {{finished}} tied for 3rd place. In his final round of 69 he three-putted from 45 feet on the 16th hole for a bogey and missed a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th, which lipped out of the hole. This resulted in him missing out by one stroke on an 18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald. Faldo refused {{to come to the}} press tent after his final round and later, en route to the locker room, snapped at a journalist who suggested that he had hit his putt too hard on the final green. Faldo said: [...] "I hit it perfect. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> foot past the hole. How can you say I hit it too hard?" ...|$|E

Them fellers back in Missouri were a lot of cheap dubs, anyhow, always kickin' because {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> ball hard I always lost it.

When I got up I couldn't see the others, and I must have lost my way. Then it began to rain and get dark, and I didn't know which way to turn. I yelled dozens of times, but I didn't hear any answer. I tried to locate the cabin, but I must have been completely turned around, for I came out on the shore. Then the flood came along, and before I knew it I was floating down the river. <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> tree and clung to that, and we drifted a mile or more before the tree got stuck on a sandbar. I stayed there, in the rain and darkness, until morning and then waded and swam ashore. I was so tired out I had to rest for awhile, and then I came up here, to try to find out something about our crowd. I was thinking of getting over to the island again when I saw you on the top of the hill. Of course, I thought Dave was Jerry." ...|$|E
