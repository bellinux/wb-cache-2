Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|Cotto faced WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight {{champion}} Sergio Martinez for {{the titles}} on June 7, 2014 {{in his first}} fight in the middleweight division at Madison Square Garden. It {{should be noted that}} Martinez was inactive for a year before this bout and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee. Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martinez was unable to bend, flex and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martinez himself proclaimed that his knee {{had nothing to do with}} the outcome of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot. Cotto knocked Martinez down 3 times in the first round and once in the ninth round before Martinez retired on <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> before the tenth round, giving Cotto the win by ninth-round corner retirement. With the win, Cotto became the first Puerto Rican boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1976–77, after {{he had made his}} first two {{international}} appearances, Botham played Grade cricket in Australia for the University of Melbourne Cricket Club. He was joined by Yorkshire's Graham Stevenson. They were signed for {{the second half of the}} season on a sponsorship arranged through the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) by Whitbread's Brewery. Five of the competition's 15 rounds were abandoned because of adverse weather. It was apparently on this trip that Botham originally fell out with the former Australian captain Ian Chappell. The cause seems to have been a cricket-related argument in a bar, which may have resulted in Chappell being pushed off <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> (the story is widely sourced but accounts differ). This became a long-running feud and, as late as the 2010–11 Ashes series, there was an altercation between Botham and Chappell in a car park at the Adelaide Oval.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1995, Hug {{entered the}} 1995 Grand Prix at {{the round of}} sixteen {{qualifier}} where his rivalry with Mike Bernardo began. Both fighters traded heavy shots with Bernardo seemingly getting the better until Hug dropped him with a high kick {{towards the end of}} the first round. The South African boxer continued to pile on the pressure, however, and in the third, knocked Hug down with a left hook shortly followed by a standing eight count. Finally, he forced Hug into a corner and delivered a relentless beating on the Swiss karateka until referee Nobuaki Kakuda finally stopped the bout after a prolonged barrage of unanswered punches. Hug had a quick turnaround, as he was back in the ring on May 4, 1995, scoring a forty-five second knockout over Peter Kramer in a K-1 World Grand Prix 1995 non-tournament affair. On June 10, 1995, Hug made the first defence of his UKF title against Dennis Lane at K-1 Fight Night in Zurich, the first K-1 event held in Switzerland.

500|$|The Mr. Hankey {{character}} {{was based on}} an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down <b>his</b> <b>stool,</b> which he called [...] "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} round Ali began {{to take control of}} the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston's right eye and a cut under his left, which {{eventually}} required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston's knees buckled and he almost went down as he was driven to the ropes. A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Ali seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Ali's body. It was probably Liston's best moment in the entire fight. [...] Sitting on <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> between rounds, Liston was breathing heavily as his cornermen worked on his cut.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} Billy Preston's song, [...] "That's the Way God Planned It", Preston gets up from <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> {{and dances}} across the stage and back again – much to Harrison's delight.

Starr sings his hit song [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and appears flustered as he forgets some of the words. Harrison then returns to the spotlight for two of his own numbers, the second being [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", {{at the end of}} which Clapton clearly struggles on lead guitar next to Harrison's more measured soloing. Before this, Harrison pauses for a few minutes to introduce the many musicians around him, and to his own amazement misses out one of the key performers so far – [...] "We've forgotten Billy Preston!"

2500|$|On 22 July 2016 it was {{announced}} on Sky Sports that Cleverly would finally meet his long-standing rival [...] Juergen Braehmer (48-2, 35 KOs) for the WBA 'Regular' light-heavyweight title on 1 October at the Jahnsportforum in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany. They were initially supposed to meet in 2011 at the O2, in London, and another fight was mooted in 2015, only for Cleverly to decide to fight in America against Fonfara. This was Braehmer's seventh defence of his title that he had held since 2013. On the night, Cleverly became a two-time world champion at light heavyweight, after Braehmer retired on <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> with an injured elbow {{at the end of}} the 6th round, which his promoter later confirmed was dislocated. The fight itself was back and forth action, with Braehmer winning most due to landing the more effective shots, particularly the left hook to the head. At the time of the stoppage, Braehmer was ahead 58-56 three times on the scorecards.|$|E

2500|$|Ali then {{agreed to}} a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila. The bout, known as the [...] "Thrilla in Manila", was held on October 1, 1975, in {{temperatures}} approaching [...] In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the [...] "rope-a-dope" [...] strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During {{this part of the}} bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, {{but for the most part}} absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called [...] "target practice" [...] on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on <b>his</b> <b>stool,</b> clearly spent.|$|E
2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on <b>his</b> <b>stool.</b> Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you say your guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off <b>his</b> <b>stool</b> and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
