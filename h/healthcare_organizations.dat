40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>organization</b> in shaping how physicians do their work. The fundamental premise of this research study asserts that the ways in which physicians construct and accomplish their work roles is greatly influenced by tensions resulting from the dual nature of various expectations of physicians within the <b>healthcare</b> <b>organization.</b> Those tensions, this study argues, are best explored by expanding the research scope to include the context in which physicians care for patients. The primary tension studied is of physician resistance to the organization’s bureaucratic control. Through analysis of in-depth interviews with practicing physicians within one <b>healthcare</b> <b>organization,</b> this study uncovers ways in which physicians struggle and cope with organizational tensions, and how that ongoing struggle both effects and affects physician identity through organizational identification. This dissertation addresses a need for more research into {{the role of}} the <b>healthcare</b> <b>organization</b> in shaping how physicians do their work so we can better understand the physician/healthcare-organization relationship. ...|$|R

25|$|Founded in 1951, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of <b>Healthcare</b> <b>Organizations</b> (JCAHO) is an independent, not-for-profit {{organization}} that evaluates and accredits nearly 15,000 health care organizations and {{programs in the}} United States. An organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years. The scope of reviews by JCAHO is broad, including hospitals, home care agencies, medical equipment providers, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, surgical centers and medical laboratories. Passing a survey is crucial for most organizations, since accreditation by JCAHO is required for participation in Medicare and some state and private health care programs.

25|$|A strict law {{aimed to}} protect people’s health from tobacco {{smoke and the}} {{consequences}} of smoking that introduced a ban on smoking in all closed public areas in compliance with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control took effect on 1 June 2013. At first smoking ban abusers were not fined - the mechanism was still under consideration. The law prohibits smoking at schools and universities, cultural and sporting organizations, beaches, stadiums, on playgrounds and in hospitals, in sanatoriums and at health resorts, inside the offices of public organizations and at filling stations. Smoking is banned aboard aircraft, on the subway and all kinds of public transport. From 15 November 2013 on, smoking at working places, near and within the educational, cultural, sporting and <b>healthcare</b> <b>organizations,</b> in houses’ hallways, at railway stations and airports is to be punished with a fine from 500 to 1,500 roubles ($15 – 45.5). The management of organizations where the ban is violated will face tougher fines. From 1 June 2014 the list will be complemented with restaurants and bars, dormitories, hotels, long-haul trains, and the boarding platforms of suburban railway stations.|$|E
