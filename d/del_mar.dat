He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E

5|$|Caltrans {{engineer}} Jacob Dekema {{announced in}} April1969 that construction on SR76 {{and the nearby}} SR 78 between I-5 and US395 would be delayed until work was underway on I-5 and US395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp <b>Del</b> <b>Mar</b> in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR76 included as a scenic highway, but SR76 has not {{been included in the}} system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR76 expanded at the end of 1974.|$|E
5|$|In June1990, the <b>Del</b> <b>Mar</b> Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition {{sued the}} San Diego City Council to {{require them to}} move the western {{terminus}} of SR56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August1, the City of San Diego received a petition {{in which more than}} 45,000people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña <b>del</b> <b>Mar</b> and the capital of Santiago. He was found with a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica to be handed over to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E
5|$|The southerly {{extension}} to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County's plans were for a toll road elevated above the Santa Ana River {{rather than through}} existing neighborhoods, only extending south to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Costa Mesa with connections to the Corona <b>del</b> <b>Mar</b> Freeway (SR 73); this was largely inspired by congestion on SR 55 through the Santa Ana area. The extension was considered by Caltrans as two 11.2-mile-long (18.0km), two-lane viaducts that would cost $950 million. The toll road franchise that American Transportation Development (ATD) held for this portion of SR 57 expired in January2001, after a request to delay the expiration until January2007. Following this, ATD sued to restore the franchise, and this case lasted until November2003. The termination was due to ATD not beginning the construction during the first ten years of the franchise, after it had been enacted by the state legislature.|$|E

The film received eight Oscar nominations, the most for any film that year, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Williams, and it won three accolades at the 78th Academy Awards. The saffron Vera Wang dress, which she wore to the Academy Awards in March 2006, has been cited by Cosmopolitan magazine as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time.|$|E
