60|$|At {{the same}} time with Mr. Prior there arrived from France Mons. Mesnager, knight {{of the order of}} St. Michael, and one of the council of trade to the Most Christian King. His {{commission}} was, in general, empowering him to treat with the minister of any prince engaged in the war against his master. In his first conferences with the Queen's ministers, he pretended orders to insist, that Her Majesty should enter upon particular engagements in several articles, which did not depend upon her, but concerned only the interest of the allies reciprocally with those of the Most Christian King; whereas the negotiation had begun upon this principle, that France should consent to adjust the interests of Great Britain in the first place, whereby Her Majesty would be afterwards enabled, by her good offices on all sides, to facilitate the general peace. The Queen resolved never to depart from this principle; but was absolutely determined to remit the particular <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> to general conferences, where she would do the utmost in her power to procure the repose of Europe, and the satisfaction of all parties. It was plain, France could run no hazard by this proceeding, because the preliminary articles would have no force before a general peace was signed: therefore it was not doubted but Mons. Mesnager would have orders to waive this new pretension, and go on in treating upon that foot which was at first proposed. In short, the ministers required a positive and speedy answer to the articles in question, since they contained only such advantages and securities as Her Majesty thought she had a right to require from any prince whatsoever, to whom the dominions of Spain should happen to fall.|$|E
60|$|These reserves, however, are {{no longer}} intact. During the long period which elapsed between the Armistice and the Peace it became {{necessary}} for the Allies to facilitate the provisioning of Germany from abroad. The political condition of Germany {{at that time and}} the serious menace of Spartacism rendered this step necessary in the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> themselves if they desired the continuance in Germany of a stable Government to treat with. The question of how such provisions were to be paid for presented, however, the gravest difficulties. A series of Conferences was held at Trèves, at Spa, at Brussels, and subsequently at Château Villette and Versailles, between representatives of the Allies and of Germany, with the object of finding some method of payment as little injurious as possible to the future prospects of Reparation payments. The German representatives maintained from the outset that the financial exhaustion of their country was for the time being so complete that a temporary loan from the Allies was the only possible expedient. This the Allies could hardly admit {{at a time when they}} were preparing demands for the immediate payment by Germany of immeasurably larger sums. But, apart from this, the German claim could not be accepted as strictly accurate so long as their gold was still untapped and their remaining foreign securities unmarketed. In any case, it was out of the question to suppose that in the spring of 1919 public opinion in the Allied countries or in America would have allowed the grant of a substantial loan to Germany. On the other hand, the Allies were naturally reluctant to exhaust on the provisioning of Germany the gold which seemed to afford one of the few obvious and certain sources for Reparation. Much time was expended in the exploration of all possible alternatives; but it was evident at last that, even if German exports and saleable foreign securities had been available to a sufficient value, they could not be liquidated in time, and that the financial exhaustion of Germany was so complete that nothing whatever was immediately available in substantial amounts except the gold in the Reichsbank. Accordingly a sum exceeding $250,000,000 in all out of the Reichsbank gold was transferred by Germany to the Allies (chiefly to the United States, Great Britain, however, also receiving a substantial sum) during the first six months of 1919 in payment for foodstuffs.|$|E

On the other hand, the Resistance movements, who sought moral legitimacy, contested the government's powers. To remedy the authorities' lack of power, the Unio’n's militia maintained order and arrested collaborators, which gave rise to abuses. The Resistance movements which were gathered in the Unio’n saw themselves as existing outside and above the traditional parties. In an appeal to the Grand Duchess, they demanded a new government.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the American Joint Chiefs of Staff {{dealt with the}} increasing inseparability {{of the political and}} military aspects of wartime strategy in a political environment characterized by little detailed policy guidance. Dealing with strategy broadly, it focuses for the most part on strategy making in the war against Japan at the national level from the TRIDENT Conference in May 1943 to final victory. ^ The TRIDENT Conference serves as a convenient start point for this analysis. The strategic debate after TRIDENT took on a more complex and sophisticated nature than before, characterized by multiple alternatives requiring a precise understanding of political and military relationships. ^ Coalition warfare naturally complicated the efforts of American strategists to reconcile the political and military aspects of wartime strategy. Dominated as it was by the disparate political <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> the strategic process in the European Theater proved especially challenging. In the war against Japan, however, problems of Pacific strategy became almost completely American problems and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had virtually a free hand in developing Pacific strategy and came to possess increasingly great strategic leverage in Far Eastern matters. ^ The study concludes that the Joint Chiefs of Staff actively considered and integrated their internal assessment of national policy objectives and political considerations in the development of American military strategy in the war against Japan. Well-schooled in their study of Clausewitz and Mahan, the Joint Chiefs of Staff understood clearly the political relationship of war and national policy and the pervasive and continuous influence of policy upon strategy. Questions of the postwar role of China, the national policy aim of unconditional surrender, and apprehensions about the willingness and capability of the American people to sustain a protracted war against Japan, all defined the dimensions of the canvas upon which the American military leadership painted their strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|Por meio da análise das máscaras funerárias do Egito Romano procuramos {{discutir}} algumas questões relevantes sobre a sociedade egípcia de então. A principal delas é a criação de uma elite local de origem grega pelo governo romano e seu papel na propagação de elementos de origem grega e romana no meio cultural egípcio, os quais podem ser observados nas características faciais e no tipo de vestimenta retratados nas máscaras funerárias. Estas formas artísticas variavam cronológica e geograficamente, conforme as particularidades regionais e o interesse da elite dominante aliada ao Império Romano. Nesta complexa rede de relações sociais, as crenças funerárias do Egito Romano mantêm a tradição que remonta ao período faraônico. A máscara pode ser considerada tanto como uma salvaguarda da memória social do morto, o qual preserva assim seu status social, como seu duplo e substituto mágico no Além. Through <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> burial masks of Roman Egypt {{we discuss}} some relevant issues bearing on <b>the</b> Egyptian society <b>of</b> those times.
