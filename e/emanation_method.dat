40|$|The surface {{areas of}} several thorium oxide and thorium oxide [...] uranium oxide {{preparations}} were {{measured by the}} <b>emanation</b> <b>method.</b> The radioactive gas- counting system employed is described, and {{a discussion of the}} procedure for converting counting data to terms of emanating power and finally to surface area values is given. Surface area values by the <b>emanation</b> <b>method</b> were compared with BET values from like samples. The difference between values obtained by the two methods was attributed to the efficiency of the radioactive gas-detecting system and the porosity of the oxide samples. The contribution of Rn/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 2 / from the oxide samples containing uranium was found to be negligible and presented no problem. Samples fired at temperatures above 1500 %DEC for one hour in air exhibited a marked increase in "room temperature" emanation rates. The predicted lattice-loosening temperature of metal oxides is approximately one-half their absolute melting point. Above this temperature, sufficient thermal agitation is induced to permit exchange and possibly permanent displacement of atoms in the crystal lattice. Therefore, firing these oxide preparations at temperatures above 1500 deg C would probably result in lattice defects throughout the crystal structure, with the surface defects contributing to an increase in surface area and a corresponding increase in the emanation rate.

40|$|Fast {{electrochemical}} deposition is a promising method for the aqueous chemistry of the superheavy elements [1]. To perform electrodeposition experiments, {{the knowledge of}} basic electrochemical parameters like deposition potentials and the deposition velocity is necessary. To prepare experiments with element 115, its homolog Bi was investigated. Experiments were performed with carrier free 212 Bi (t 1 / 2 = 60 min, Eγ = 727 keV). 1 ml of a solution of 212 Pb in 0. 5 M HCl was obtained via the <b>emanation</b> <b>method</b> [2]. The solution was passed through a column (d = 8 mm, l = 15 mm) filled with the cation exchanger Dowex 50 x 8 (100 - 200 mesh). Under the given conditions 212 Pb is retained, whereas 212 Bi forms an anionic chloro complex and passes the column. A total elution volume of 2 ml was sufficient to elute 90 % of the activity. The eluate was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 1 ml 0. 1 M HCl. Deposition yield /...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{preparation}} of the first terrestrial helium by degassing uraniumminerals in the year 1895 rare gas/solid systems have been of interest in science and technology (e. g. the Hahn <b>emanation</b> <b>method,</b> the determination of the geological age of potassium minerals, the behaviour of fission gases in reactor fuels). In the last ten years a fundamenta 1 aspect, namely the atomic transport of Ar, Kr and Xe in simple cubic ionic crystals (alkali halides of NaCl- and CsCl-structure, and alkaline earth fluorides of CaF 2 -structure) has been studied thoroughly. This paper gives a survey of the hitherto published literature, however, with emphasis on the work based on the introduction of rare gas atoms by transformation of lattice components with nuclear reactions. The two main features of these investigations are that the gas atoms are mobile in most cases as interstitials and that they react with lattice defects. Such defects may be e. g. thermally or chemically introduced cation vacancies and radiation induced defects. The experimental technique to determine the gas mobility with the help of radioactive tracers is briefly described. The main experimental results are summarized and compared with the calculations of Norgett and Lidiard...|$|E
40|$|Side channel attacks usually target {{implementations}} of cryptographic algorithms on {{smart cards}} or FPGA’s, {{but can also}} be used to recognize other microprocessor activities, such as program, instruction or argument executed. One particular article by Quisquater and Samyde [1] demonstrates how to automatically reverse engineer software code, based on power and electromagnetic signatures. In their article, it is stated that data/addresses of equal Hamming Weight (HW), such as 55 and AA cannot be distinguished without using localization principles (i. e positioning of tiny probes to identify the location of the <b>emanation).</b> Recent <b>methods,</b> such as the Template Attack [2] has overcome this limitation. This is achieved by building precise noise models using identical devices, prior to the attack. Key bytes or intermediate values of cryptographic algorithms, i. e data transfers, can be distinguished, using a Bayesian classifier, even for byte values of equal HW [2]. In this article we present experimental results, validating that the Template Attack can distinguish very similar micro processor activities. Using a modified Template Attack on electromagnetic emanation from smart cards, we are able to distinguish parallel address bus activities of equal HW. We also present an alternative method to select the application specific features necessary (i. e points of interest). ...|$|R
40|$|Implementation attacks {{describe}} {{the extraction of}} information from the physical behaviour of a target device. As shown by various authors, regardless of the mathematical security of a cryptographic algorithm, {{there may be a}} leak of some information, which reveals, e. g., a secret key. However, the way of measuring this information introduces several crucial parameters which decide about the efficiency or success of revealing the secret key of a target device. In this thesis, we compare different so called side-channels, namely power consumption and electromagnetic <b>emanation,</b> and evaluate <b>methods</b> and parameters for a differential correlation analysis. Furthermore, we capture the electromagnetic emanation with various probes at different positions, e. g., in the near-field and {{on the surface of the}} integrated circuit. In addition, we compare the practical influence of different measurement parameters, e. g., sample rate and quantisation, and, in order to improve the results, different preprocessing techniques, e. g., alignment, transformation to the frequency domain, and peak extraction. Two popular 8 bit microcontrollers running the Advanced Encryption Standard with a well-known vulnerability are chosen as target devices. Yet, our results can be universally adapted to other devices and ciphers as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the main}} sources of public {{exposure}} from natural radioactivity are radium and radon, and their short-lived decay products. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the concentration of these radionuclides in the mineral water resources of one of the highest-altitude regions (Zagros Mountains) in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, in the south-west of Iran, namely Dimeh Springs. Eighty drinking springwater samples were taken from Dimeh Springs (ten samples for each spring) to determine the radium- 226 and radon- 222 concentrations using the <b>emanation</b> <b>method</b> and a liquid scintillation counting method, respectively. The results showed that the effective dose from the consumption of drinking water of Dimeh Springs (6. 4 μSv y- 1) is not comparable with the other annual effective doses, such as inhalation of radon and its products in cosmic and terrestrial rays. Also, the annual effective dose measured here is much less than the worldwide mean value of 0. 45 mSv (UNSCEAR, 2000), and is below the proposed limits in other countries. Hence, this source may be regarded as safe drinking water in the region. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|E

The Ra- 224 activity in the sample was evaluated using the decay dynamics relationship between parent Ra- 228 and daughter Th- 228. The concentration and distribution feature of Ra- 228 in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea were studied and the Ra- 228 concentrations in the surface seawater of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea were in the range 0. 09 - 15. 0 Bq/m(3) {{with an average of}} 6. 84 Bq/m(3) during the summer cruise, and in the range 0. 09 - 16. 9 Bq/m(3) with an average of 6. 37 Bq/m(3) during the winter cruise. The Ra- 228 distribution in the northern Yellow Sea was different from the southern Yellow Sea and East China Sea. The highest Ra- 228 activity of surface water was located {{in the middle of the}} northern Yellow Sea, but for the southern Yellow Sea and East China Sea, it decreased with increasing distance from China continent...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Includes bibliographical references. The {{quantitative}} {{determination of the}} small amounts of radium present in the atmosphere, spring waters, minerals and rocks involves two steps: (1) The quantitative separation of the radium emanation in a known weight of the sample and (2) measurement of the ionization current produced by the emanation in a calibrated electroscope. Granting that we have accurate methods of separating radium emanation, the other problem of measuring the ionization of current and the calibration of the electroscopes for quantitative work must be given careful study, because the results ultimately depend upon the calibration constants of the electroscopes used. In the estimation of radium, the electroscope corresponds to the weights and analytical balance in ordinary quantitative chemical analysis. An electroscope {{is said to be}} standardized or calibrated when we know the quantity of radium, (or uranium) represented by some constant of the instrument. The present investigation includes the calibration of three types of alpha ray electroscopes extensively used for the determination of small quantities of radium by the <b>emanation</b> <b>method.</b> The known quantities of the radium emanation required in these experiments were obtained, (1) from uraninite (Pitchblende) of known uranium content, and (2) from a standard radium solution. In this connection a comparative study was made of the types of apparatus employed by several investigators for the separation of the emanation and its transfer to the electroscopes, with a view of standardizing the existing methods for the calibration of electroscopes.
