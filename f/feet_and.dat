40|$|Background: Surgical {{specialties}} {{have become}} increasingly subspecialized.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle {{condition}} between elite ath-letes and non-athletes. [Subjects] The elite athletes group included 85 subjects (28 males and 57 females) and the non-athletes group included 85 subjects (38 males and 47 females). [Methods] All subjects were evaluated for pain (visual analogue scale, VAS) <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle condition (The <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> Ankle Disability Index, FADI, <b>and</b> The <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> Ankle Outcome Score, FAOS). [Results] The elite athlete group showed significant differences from the non-athletes group in VAS, FADI (FADI, FADI-Sports), and FAOS (FAOS-symptoms, FAOS-pain, FAOS-ADL, FAOS-sports, FAOS-QoL). In addition, a meaningful difference in VAS, FADI-Sports, and FAOS-symptoms was observed between gymnasts and wrestlers. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest the necessity prevention of injury to the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle of elite athletes, and for the development of exercise for the rehabilitation of <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle injuries, because there is a difference in <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle condition between elite athletes and non-athletes...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle {{surgery is}} one of the {{orthopaedic}} subspecialties to which residents not uncommonly receive limited exposure. Therefore, it is important to identify what both faculty and residents regard as fundamental to a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle rotation. The purposes of this study were to iden-tify the essential components of a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle rotation and to correlate these with the American Orthopaedic <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> Society (AOFAS) core curriculum, and to discuss how to integrate resident input and AOFAS guidelines into a valued <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle rotation. Methods: Over a 5 -year period, each orthopaedic resident beginning a 10 -week postgraduate year (PGY) 3 <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle rotation was asked to choose topics to be covered during weekly 45 -minute discussion conferences.

5000|$|<b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle {{surgeons}} {{are trained}} to treat all disorders of the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle, both surgical and non-surgical. Additionally, the surgeons are also trained to understand the complex connections between disorders and deformities of the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and the spine. Therefore, the surgeon will typically see cases that vary from trauma (such as malleolar fractures, tibial pilon fractures, calcaneus fractures, navicular and midfoot injuries and metatarsal and phalangeal fractures.) Arthritis care (primarily surgical) of the ankle joint and the joints of the hindfoot (tarsals), midfoot (metatarsals) and forefoot (phalanges) also plays a rather significant role. Congentital and acquired deformalities include adult acquired flatfoot, non-neuromuscular foot deformity, diabetic foot disorders, hallux valgus and several common pediatric <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle conditions (such as clubfoot, flat feet, tarsal coalitions, etc.) Patients may also be referred to a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle surgeon for proper {{diagnosis and treatment of}} heel pain (such as a consequence from plantar heel fasciitis), nerve disorders (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome) and tumors of the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle. Amputation and ankle arthroscopy (the use of a laparoscope in <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle surgical procedures) have emerged as prominent tools in <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle care.

40|$|Background <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle {{structures}} {{are the most}} commonly affected in people with gout. However, the effect of gout on <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle muscle strength is not well understood. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether differences exist in <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle muscle strength for plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion and eversion between people with gout and age- and sex-matched controls. The secondary aim was to determine whether <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle muscle strength was correlated with <b>foot</b> pain <b>and</b> disability. Methods Peak isokinetic concentric muscle torque was measured for ankle plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, eversion and inversion in 20 participants with gout and 20 matched controls at two testing velocities (30 °/s and 120 °/s) using a Biodex dynamometer. <b>Foot</b> pain <b>and</b> disability was measured using the Manchester <b>Foot</b> Pain <b>and</b> Disability Index (MFPDI). Findings Participants with gout demonstrated reduced muscle strength at both the 30 °/s and 120 °/s testing velocities for plantarflexion, inversion and eversion (P < 0. 05). People with gout also displayed a reduced plantarflexion-to-dorsiflexion strength ratio at both 30 °/s and 120 °/s (P < 0. 05). <b>Foot</b> pain <b>and</b> disability was higher in people with gout (P < 0. 0001) and MFPDI scores were inversely correlated with plantarflexion and inversion muscle strength at the 30 °/s testing velocity, and plantarflexion, inversion and eversion muscle strength at the 120 °/s testing velocity (all P < 0. 05). Interpretation People with gout have reduced <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle muscle strength <b>and</b> experience greater <b>foot</b> pain <b>and</b> disability compared to controls. <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle strength reductions are strongly associated with increased <b>foot</b> pain <b>and</b> disability in people with gout...|$|R
