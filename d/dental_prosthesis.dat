5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which [...] materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, dental {{implantology}} is {{a reliable}} technique {{for treatment of}} partially and completely edentulous patients. The achievement of stable dentition is ensured by implant-supported fixed <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Morse taper conometric system may provide fixed retention between implants and <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate retentive performance and mechanical strength of a Morse taper conometric system used as implant-supported fixed <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> retention. Experimental and finite element investigations were performed. Experimental tests were achieved on a specific abutment-coping system, accounting for both cemented and non-cemented situations. The results from the experimental activities were processed to identify the mechanical behavior of the coping-abutment interface. Finally, the achieved information was applied to develop reliable finite element models of different abutment-coping systems. The analyses were developed accounting for different geometrical conformations of the abutment-coping system, such as different taper angle. The results showed that activation process, occurred through a suitable insertion force, could provide retentive performances equal to a cemented system without compromising the mechanical functionality of the system. These findings suggest that Morse taper conometrical system can provide a fixed connection between implants and <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> if proper insertion force is applied.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{condition}} of generalised skeletal fragility caused by diminishing bone amount and disturbance in bone microarchitecture with implication that the bone's ability to withstand forces is decreased.

40|$|Alumina- and zirconia-based ceramic dental restorations are {{designed}} to repair functionality as well as esthetics of the failed teeth. However, these materials exhibited several performance deficiencies such as fracture, poor esthetic properties of ceramic cores (particularly zirconia cores), and difficulty in accomplishing a strong ceramic–resin-based cement bond.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{determining}} the physico-chemical surface properties of both <b>dental</b> and intrabony <b>prostheses</b> is a powerful means that may help elucidating some fundamental features of the interface between the recipient tissues and the prosthesis itself. When dealing with <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> (total dentures, fixed <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses,</b> partial removable <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses),</b> a continuous contact with different tissues and body fluids is required for their different parts. Indeed roughness, porosity and surface energy, as well as surface elemental composition, will strongly influence the response of the tissues, eventually contributing to the success or fail of the prosthesis. This is even more true for the implant-supported fixed <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses,</b> where an intra-bony part, i. e. the dental implant, is connected through a transmucous structure, i. e. the implant abutment, to the intraoral part, i. e. the fixed prosthesis. Thus the same titanium material is supposed to enhance both bone and epithelial healing, whilst the intraoral framework and artificial teeth -which may be made by several different materials- are to avoid bacterial adhesion as much as possible. Several surface modification processes are currently used in order to improve the prostheses performances, but many of them are still not completely satisfactory, and a continuous research effort is still required to improve their effectiveness. In this chapter, we describe the use of silicon-based amorphous thin film alloys to improve the performances of <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> and implants. Indeed, hydrogenated amorphous silicon-based alloys, such as amorphous hydrogenated silicon-oxygen (a-SiOx:H) alloys possess interesting properties, which can be exploited for the surface modification of <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> and implants. They are inert and largely biocompatible materials and do not embed dangerous metallic elements, such as Ni, Al, Cr, or Mo, which could be released into the body during the long term contact within living tissues. Moreover, the hydrogen incorporation, which is typical of amorphous material grown by plasma-assisted CVD techniques, has already been proven helpful in enhancing the biocompatibility of silicon and silicon-based materials. We studied the effects of amorphous silicon-based alloys for the performance improvement of several bulk materials used for the fabrication of prostheses and implants, including ceramics, resins, titanium and cobalt-chromium alloys. The films showed interesting properties as for the bacterial adhesion reduction, the biocompatibility improvement and the corrosion protection of bulk materials under stud...|$|R
