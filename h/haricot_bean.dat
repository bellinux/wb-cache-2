40|$|<b>Haricot</b> <b>bean</b> is {{considered}} {{as the main}} cash crop and protein source of the farmers in many low lands and mid altitude zones of Ethiopia. The country’s export earning from <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> exceeds that of other pulses such as lentils, horse bean and chickpea. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption of improved technologies and poor marketing system, were among the major problems. Adoption of improved technologies {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in Ethiopia. However, the adoption and dissemination of these technologies is constrained by various factors. To this end, the aim of this study was to empirically examine factors affecting adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package in the study area. Two stage sampling procedure was followed to select rural kebeles and households for the study. Four rural kebeles were selected purposively, and 160 household heads were selected randomly using probability proportional to size sampling. Structured interview schedule was developed, pre-tested and used for collecting the essential quantitative data for the study from the sampled households. Focus group discussion was used to generate qualitative data. In addition, secondary data were collected from relevant sources such as woreda office of agriculture and rural development and others. The result of the study indicated that majority of farmers in the study area preferred local variety over improved because of local market and consumption demand. Moreover, farmers’ practice was found largely to deviate from research and extension recommendations. Result of the econometric model indicated that household head’s attitude towards <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production technology package, participation in extension event (participation in training and field visit) and access to credit were important variables which had positively and significantly influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package. Where as, perceived relative disadvantage of technology attributes of the household head had shown negative relationship with adoption and intensity of adoption. Some farmers who previously adopted improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties have discontinued planting the varieties mainly due to market problem. The overall finding of the study underlined the high importance of institutional support in the areas of extension; credit and market to enhance adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package. Therefore, policy and development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support system so as to achieve wider adoption, increased productivity and income to small scale farmers.

40|$|<b>Haricot</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food legumes of Ethiopia and it is considered as the main cash crop and the least expensive source of protein for the farmers in many lowlands and mid altitude of the country. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption of improved technologies and poor marketing system, were among the major problems. Adoption of improved technologies {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in Ethiopia. However, the adoption and dissemination of these technologies is constrained by various factors. The aim of this study was to examine factors affecting adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties and associated agronomic practices in Dale Woreda, Sidama zone of SNNPR. In the area, <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> is an important crop, which serves as a source of food and cash. A total of 150 sample households (131 male and 19 female) selected from 5 kebeles of the Woreda were interviewed using structured interview schedule. Qualitative data were collected using group discussion and field observation. Data analysis was done with the help SPSS 17; mainly Chi-square test, F-test Cramer’s V, and Pearson Correlation. Tobit econometrics model was employed using STATA 11. The results of the econometric model indicated that the relative influence of different variables on probability and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production Thus,,sex of house hold head,, attending training on improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production, attending field day programs, conducting demonstration, access to improved seed credit and membership of seed multiplication group were positively and significantly influenced where as market distance negatively influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties and associated agronomic practices. Farmers’ evaluation and selection criteria of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties in the study area in order of importance were high yielding, market demand, price advantage, time of maturity, grain color, grain size, disease resistance and storability. Based on these criteria Nasir variety ranks first and dimtu variety ranks second. In addition, majority of farmers in the study area used seed and fertilizer rates below research and extension recommendations. Farmers’ deviation from recommended package practices was found partly due to inadequate extension service, high cost of fertilizer and also lack of finance. The overall findings of the study underlined the high importance of extension service provision to improve farmers’ access to information and extension advices to address the recommended agronomic practices practically, facilitating access to credit and improving market condition, Attention has to be given to women household headed to participate in improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production, Therefore development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support systems to increase adoption and productivity of the crop.

40|$|The Improving Productivity and Market Success (IPMS) of Ethiopian Farmers project {{adopted a}} “participatory market {{oriented}} commodity value chain development” approach, to address problems and potentials for <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production in Alaba Special District, in Southern Ethiopia. With an emerging export market potential, attention {{needs to be}} paid {{not only to the}} production of haricot beans but also to the supply of inputs and services and marketing. Major problems diagnosed by the value chain partners included poor access to inputs including seeds, weed and disease problems, poor technology adoption and marketing of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean.</b> To address the above problems, various development actors developed <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> commodity with the IPMS project and Alaba Special District Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) introduced value chain interventions {{for the past five years}} (2005 to 2010). Initial intervention focused at building farmers capacity to multiply seed and establish seed bank using visits, trainings, demonstration, workshops, promotion and discussion. Later, to improve supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer and agro-chemicals) support was provided to establish cooperative shop, private crop protection service and revolving fund with IPMS credit fund while comparing soil fertility technologies. Additional effort also focused at marketing of small pack, promotion of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean,</b> market linkage and establishment of seed cooperative. Findings show an increase in farmers’ market participation from 54. 5 % in 2004 during baseline survey to 92 % in 2009 during sample household survey. There is an increase in the proportion of farmers’ producing seed and change in focus from household consumption to seed business in targeted 19 PAs (Peasant Association). Survey results show a higher yield (9. 5 qt/ha) among fertilizer users compared with non users (7. 2 qt/ha). On-farm yield plot trial (n= 387) with 129 households (HH) in 17 PAs for three years shows mean yield of 7. 04, 4. 1 and 2. 76 qt/ha for chemical fertilizer, <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> inoculants and control plots respectively. Farmers have clearly indicated their preference for the red and/or speckled varieties to white varieties. Increase in <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> seed multipliers from 64 HH in 4 PA to 426 HH in 19 PAs resulted in establishment of seed cooperative. While more actors are increasingly involved in value chain development leading to market oriented production, there is informal partnership and poor linkage among value chain actors. The study draws lessons on increasing production of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean,</b> strengthening input supply system and development of market intervention.
