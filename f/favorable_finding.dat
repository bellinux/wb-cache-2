40|$|Consumers demand, in {{addition}} to excellent eating quality, high standards of microbial and chemical safety in shelf-stable foods. This requires improving conventional processing technologies and developing new alternatives such as pressure-assisted thermal processing (PATP). Studies in PATP foods on the kinetics of chemical reactions at temperatures (approximately 100 to 120 Â°C) inactivating bacterial spores in low-acid foods are severely lacking. This review focuses on a specific chemical safety risk in PATP foods: models predicting if the activation volume value (V a) of a chemical reaction is positive or negative, and indicating if the reaction rate constant will decrease or increase with pressure, respectively, are not available. Therefore, the pressure effect on reactions producing toxic compounds must be determined experimentally. A recent model solution study showed that acrylamide formation, a potential risk in PATP foods, is actually inhibited by pressure (that is, itsV avalue must be positive). This <b>favorable</b> <b>finding</b> was not predictable and {{still needs to be}} confirmed in food systems. Similar studies are required for other reactions producing toxic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, N-nitroso compounds, and hormone like-peptides.

40|$|We {{consider}} a Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDP) commonly encountered in real-world logistics operations. The problem involves {{a set of}} practical complications that have received little attention in the vehicle routing literature. In this problem, there are multiple vehicle types available to cover a set of pickup and delivery requests, {{each of which has}} pickup time windows and delivery time windows. Transportation orders and vehicle types must satisfy a set of compatibility constraints that specify which orders cannot be covered by which vehicle types. In addition we include some dock service capacity constraints as is required on common real world operations. This problem requires to be attended on large scale instances (orders ≥ 500), (vehicles ≥ 150). As a generalization of the traveling salesman problem, clearly this problem is NP-hard. The exact algorithms are too slow for large scale instances. The PDP-TWDS is both a packing problem (assign order to vehicles), and a routing problem (find the best route for each vehicle). We propose to solve the problem in three stages. The first stage constructs initials solutions at aggregate level relaxing some constraints on the original problem. The other two stages imposes time windows and dock service constraints. Our results are <b>favorable</b> <b>finding</b> good quality solutions in relatively short computational times...|$|E

40|$|On its face, Rule 23 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seems {{tailor-made}} for lawsuits against government.

E, ? medida que o portador de sofrimento ps?quico vai se reabilitando, devem surgir novas estruturas para compor sua rede de apoio e dar suporte em seu processo de desinstitucionaliza??o e inclus?o social. Este estudo objetivou conhecer a trajet?ria do portador de sofrimento ps?quico no processo de desinstitucionaliza??o, considerando o processo de reabilita??o e inclus?o social. Trata-se de um estudo compreensivo - interpretativo e de car?ter qualitativo, fundamentado nos pressupostos da Hist?ria Oral, proposta por Bom Meihy. Foi realizado com dez usu?rios que se tratavam em um CAPS do munic?pio de Campina Grande/PB/Brasil e que estavam em processo de reabilita??o e inclus?o social. O {{material}} emp?rico foi produzido no per?odo de Junho a Julho de 2012 e seguiu todas as etapas de produ??o de material emp?rico proposta por Bom Meihy. Os achados da investiga??o foram discutidos ? luz da t?cnica da an?lise tem?tica interpretativa proposta por Minayo, que resultou em um grande eixo tem?tico intitulado: Trajet?rias de vida: da supera??o do preconceito ao fortalecimento da resili?ncia e tr?s subeixos tem?ticos: Da Casa aos Servi?os Psiqui?tricos; Do CAPS ? fam?lia, escola e trabalho; Em busca de um novo lugar social: Possibilidades e dificuldades. Os resultados revelaram hist?rias de dor, abuso, viol?ncia, mis?ria, abandono, que contribu?ram para o desencadeamento das crises, e posterior procura aos servi?os especializados. O preconceito foi um dos obst?culos mais dif?ceis de ser enfrentado pelos colaboradores e as narrativas demonstram muita f?, resili?ncia, empoderamento e supera??o deste preconceito e estigma social. A descoberta do CAPS como um lugar de apoio, cuidado e reabilita??o, promoveu a constru??o de uma rede de apoio e proporcionou a intersetorialidade como in?meros ?rg?os que favoreceram a inclus?o social dessas pessoas no mercado de trabalho, escola e v?rios ambientes sociais. Entretanto, o CAPS tornou-se um ambiente amb?guo no tocante ? inclus?o atrav?s do trabalho, pois quem produzia fora n?o podia comercializar seu artesanato dentro do servi?o, o que denotou uma inabilidade dos profissionais do CAPS em atuar nesta esfera do cuidado. Uma estrat?gia que os colaboradores utilizaram para se reinserir no mercado de trabalho foi a omiss?o de que um dia se trataram no CAPS, driblando o estigma que receberam quando come?aram a se tratar em um servi?o de Sa?de Mental. Um entrave revelado foi falta de fomento financeiro para as mais diversas iniciativas de inclus?o social, mas, nesta investiga??o, foi apontado o norte da economia solid?ria, que proporcionou o aumento da autonomia dos sujeitos envolvidos e criou espa?os para uma gest?o descentralizadora e participativa. E, como achado mais favor?vel desta investiga??o, foi a possibilidade da desinstitucionaliza??o no sentido ampliado.

The Psychiatric Reform Law 10. 216 / 2001, {{created the}} conditions for the gradual replacement of asylums {{and as a result}} opened the possibility of breaking away from the hospital-hegemonic model, a model for community-based. And, as the bearer of mental suffering will be rehabilitated, new structures must emerge to compose your support network, and support in their process of Deinstitutionalization and Social Inclusion. This study aimed to know the trajectory of the carrier of the mental suffering in the deinstitutionalization process, considering the process of rehabilitation and social inclusion. This is a comprehensive study - interpretative and qualitative, based on the assumptions of Oral History, proposed by Bom Meihy. Was conducted with ten users that they were in a CAPS in Campina Grande / PB / Brazil and that {{were in the process of}} rehabilitation and social inclusion. The empirical material was produced in the period from June to July 2012, and followed all the steps of production of empirical material proposed by Bom Meihy. The empirical material was discussed in light of the interpretive thematic analysis technique proposed by Minayo, which resulted in a large main theme entitled: Trajectories of life: the overcoming of prejudice to strengthening the resilience and three sub-themes: From House to Psychiatric Services; The CAPS family, school and work; Looking for a new social place: Possibilities and difficulties. The results revealed stories of pain, abuse, violence, poverty, abandonment, contributing to the onset of seizures, and subsequent demand for specialized services. Prejudice was one of the most difficult obstacles to be faced by the employees, and the narratives demonstrate great faith, resilience, empowerment and overcoming this prejudice and social stigma. The discovery of CAPS as a place of support, care and rehabilitation, promoted the construction of a network of support and provided intersectorality as numerous agencies that favor the inclusion of such persons in the labor market, school and various social environments. However, CAPS has become an ambiguous environment with respect to inclusion through work, for he had produced, could not be marketed within the craft service, which denoted an inability of professionals to act in this sphere CAPS care. A strategy that employees used to reenter the job market, was the omission of one day were treated in CAPS, dodging the stigma they received when they started dealing in a Mental Health service. One obstacle was revealed a lack of financial development for diverse social inclusion initiatives, but in this research, was appointed the solidarity economy, which provided increased autonomy of the individuals involved, and created spaces for a decentralized and participatory management.

Scientific advances have occurred in immunology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic and clinical assessment tools, and recent discovery of unique therapeutic targets has spurred numerous Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Reductions in MS relapse rates and improvements in T 2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesion burdens have been reported from Phase III trials that include fingolimod, alemtuzumab, cladribine, and rituximab.

40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated that a three-dimensional (3 D) intensity image can be preserved to a reasonable extent with a binary Fresnel hologram called the grid-cross down-sampling (GCD) binary hologram, if the intensity image is first down-sampled with a grid-cross lattice prior to the generation of the hologram. It has also been shown that the binary hologram generated with such means can be embedded with a binary image without causing observable artifact on the reconstructed image. Hence, the method can be further extended to embed an intensity image by binarizing it with error diffusion. Despite the <b>favorable</b> <b>findings,</b> the visual quality of the retrieved embedded intensity image from the hologram is rather poor. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this problem. First, we employ the block truncation coding (BTC) to convert the intensity image into a binary bit stream. Next, the binary bit stream is embedded into the GCD binary hologram. The embedded image can be recovered with a BTC decoder, as well as a noise suppression scheme if the hologram is partially damaged. Experimental results demonstrate that with our proposed method, the visual quality of the embedded intensity image is superior to that of the existing approach, and the extracted image preserves favorably even if the binary hologram is damaged and contaminated with noise.

Scientific advances have occurred in immunology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic and clinical assessment tools, and recent discovery of unique therapeutic targets has spurred numerous Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Reductions in MS relapse rates and improvements in T 2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesion burdens have been reported from Phase III trials that include fingolimod, alemtuzumab, cladribine, and rituximab. Promising Phase II trial data exist for teriflunomide, daclizumab, laquinimod, and fumarate. The optimism created by these <b>favorable</b> <b>findings</b> must be tempered with evaluation of the adverse effect profile produced by these new agents. Given the discovery of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy {{with the use of}} natalizumab, ongoing vigilance for rare and life-threatening reactions due to new agents should be paramount. Patients with MS often experience difficulty with ambulation, spasticity, and cognition. Recent clinical trial data from two Phase III dalfampridine-SR trials indicate certain patients receive benefits in ambulation. This article provides an overview of data from clinical trials of newer agents of potential benefit in MS.
