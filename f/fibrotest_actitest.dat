40|$|BACKGROUND: Determining {{the stage}} and grade of liver- {{fibrosis}} by liver biopsy is important in managing patients with liver diseases causing fibrosis. Commercially Biopredictive provides per internet non- invasive analytical tests (<b>Fibrotest,</b> <b>Actitest)</b> for diagnosis of liver- fibrosis. AIMS: To evaluate non- invasive methods for analytical determination of liver- fibrosis using the example of Fibrotest an Actitest, {{in terms of the}} influence of inter- and intra- laboratory analytical variabilities. Biopredictive disposes of an not released algorithm. METHODS: On the one hand the investigations of Fibrotest and Actitest based on quality validated findings of interlaboratory tests of INSTAND and DGKL. Still permitted limits of permissible errors of analytes were used in different combinations for the calculations. 64 tests were performed. One the other hand serum from 4 confirmed hepatitis C patients with liver fibrosis was analysed in six laboratories for the required sample components. The calculated grade and stage of fibrosis by Fibrotest and Actitest were compared with biopsy results. RESULTS: The 64 calculations of Fibrotest showed a spread of a distribution from F 2 -F 4. Actitest results were similar in spreading, from A 1 -A 2 to A 3. The interlaboratory reproducibility of the 4 patient sera could almost be achieved, but there was a big discrepancy between biopsy results and the Actitest/ Fibrotest calculations. Test results could not validate the verified grade and stage of fibrosis. The error rate was 77 % (Fibrotest) and 73 % (Actitest). CONCLUSION: The influence of analytical variability on Fibrotest and Actitest cannot assure a correct diagnosis of fibrosis. Even the validity put the tests into question...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: One of the {{multiple}} factors contributing to virological response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is interferon-gamma-inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10). Its level reflects the status of interferon-stimulated genes, {{which in turn is}} associated with virological response to antiviral therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of serum IP- 10 levels on sustained virological response (SVR) and the association of this parameter with insulin resistance (IR) and liver histology. Methods: Two hundred and three consecutive biopsy proven CHC patients were included in the study. Serum levels of IP- 10 were determined using ELISA method. IR was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR). Histological features were assessed invasively by liver biopsy and noninvasively using <b>FibroTest,</b> <b>ActiTest</b> and SteatoTest. Predictive factors for SVR and their interrelations were assessed. Results: A cut-off value for IP- 10 of 392 pg/ml was obtained to discriminate between responders and non-responders. SVR was obtained in 107 patients (52. 70 %). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for SVR was 0. 875 with a sensitivity of 91. 6 per cent, specificity 74. 7 per cent, positive predictive value 80. 3 per cent and negative predictive value 88. 7 per cent. Higher values of IP- 10 were associated with increasing stages of fibrosis (P< 0. 01) and higher grades of inflammation (P= 0. 02, P= 0. 07) assessed morphologically and noninvasively through FibroTest and ActiTest. Significant steatosis and IR were also associated with increased levels of IP- 10 (P= 0. 01 and P= 0. 02). In multivariate analysis, IP- 10 levels and fibrosis stages were independently associated with SVR. Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings showed that the assessment of serum IP- 10 level could be a predictive factor for SVR and it was associated with fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity, significant steatosis and IR in patients with chronic HCV infection...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Fibrotest</b> (FT) and <b>Actitest</b> (AT) are {{biochemical}} {{markers of}} fibrosis and activity {{for use as}} a non-invasive alternative to liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim {{of this study was to}} perform an external validation of FT and AT and to study the discordances between FT/AT and liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: A total of 519 consecutive patients with chronic HCV were prospectively included in five centers, with liver biopsy and biochemical markers taken at the same day. Fifteen patients were excluded because their biopsies could not be interpreted. Diagnostic accuracies were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis...|$|R
