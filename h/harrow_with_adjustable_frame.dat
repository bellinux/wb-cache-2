40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{proposed}} project for a video-based choreography tool, we carry out video acquisition experiments with a Sony DCR-VX 2000 camcorder that operates at 25 frames/sec and a high-speed HCC 1000 video camera <b>with</b> <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> rates. We perform tests with frame rates up to 462 frames/sec and observe that the performance of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracking algorithm improves significantly as the frame rate increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of an available dance notation, the Labanotation, to the video-captured ballet scene...|$|R
5000|$|... 917/30-001 Original Can-Am test chassis <b>with</b> <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> and {{wheelbase}} - {{built to}} ’73 “Spyder” spec. Periodicals describe this car {{as a type}} “917/20TC” dubbed so because {{of the use of}} a 917/30 front section mated to a 917/10 rear section. Was tested with Mark Donohue from 72-73 and later raced by Herbert Müller in 1974-75 Interserie in Martini colours. In 1975 it was rebuilt & painted green for Vaillant Racing. In 1976 this car was retired. It is now with Porsche AG where it has been almost exclusively stored at the Porsche Museum ever since.|$|R
40|$|In the {{sinusoidal}} phase modulating interferometer technique, {{the high-speed}} CCD {{is necessary to}} detect the interference signals. The reason of ordinary CCD's low frame rate was analyzed, and a novel high-speed image sensing technique <b>with</b> <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> rate based on ail ordinary CCD was proposed. And {{the principle of the}} image sensor was analyzed. When the maximum frequency and channel bandwidth were constant, a custom high-speed sensor was designed by using the ordinary CCD {{under the control of the}} special driving circuit. The frame rate of the ordinary CCD has been enhanced by controlling the number of pixels of every frame; therefore, the ordinary of CCD can be used as the high frame rate image sensor with small amount of pixels. The multi-output high-speed image sensor has the deficiencies of low accuracy, and high cost, while the high-speed image senor with small number of pixels by using this technique can overcome theses faults. The light intensity varying with time was measured by using the image sensor. The frame rate was LIP to 1600 frame per second (f/s), and the size of every frame and the <b>frame</b> rate were <b>adjustable.</b> The correlation coefficient between the measurement result and the standard values were higher than 0. 98026, and the relative error was lower than 0. 53 %. The experimental results show that this sensor is fit to the measurements of sinusoidal phase modulating interferometer technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

25|$|While the {{previous}} system, Copenhagen City Bikes, was {{considered one of}} the first examples of modern bike share systems, it was also of little or no use to commuters, and was mainly seen as serving tourists and casual users since it was primarily designed to prevent bike theft. This was set to change with the city's new bike share system opening in 2013, which should be designed specifically for commuters, in order to function as a range extender for the public transit system. With that in mind, the cities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg have appointed the operator of the S-train system, DSB to both tender and subsequently run the system. In 2013, a new system, Bycyklen, provided by Gobike has been put into function, once fully installed it will provide 1,260 modern bikes <b>with</b> aluminium <b>frame,</b> <b>adjustable</b> seat-height and GPS-guidance.|$|R

However, corresponding pixels {{from the different}} cameras do not necessarily arrive {{at exactly the same}} time in general, mainly due to slight mismatches of the two camera clocks. To fully synchronize the video streams at pixel level, the incoming video streams are temporarily stored in small line FIFOs to compensate for the time offsets.|$|R
