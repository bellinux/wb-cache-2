Two equivalent approaches: the Multimonitor method and the Non-linear least-squares method, based on integral (reaction rate) techniques applied to thin foils of gold, zirconium, vanadium, dysprosium, copper, manganese and molybdenum, were used. The Non-linear least-squares approach was found superior to the Multimonitor method {{on the basis of}} smaller resulting uncertainties. The resulting parameters are: α = -. 0396 ±. 0104 and f = 16. 89 ± 1. 08 for the Rabbit and α = -. 0296 ±. 0089 and f = 19. 57 ± 1. 26 for the Susan, where the reported uncertainties represent one sigma values...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{related to}} reactor physics {{parameters}} {{were made in}} three heavy water lattices. The three lattices studied consisted of 0. 250 -inch-diameter, 1. 03 w/o U 2 3 5 uranium fuel rods arranged in triangular arrays and spaced at 1. 25, 1. 75, and 2. 50 inches. The following quantities were measured {{in each of the}} three lattices studied: the ratio of the average <b>epicadmium</b> U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod to the average subcadmium U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod ([sigma] 28); the ratio of the average <b>epicadmium</b> U 2 3 o fission rate in the fuel rod 7 to the average subcadmium U 35 fission rate in the fuel rod (625); the ratio of the average U 2 3 8 capture rate in the fuel rod to the average U 2 3 5 fission rate in the fuel rod (C); the ratio of the average U 2 3 8 fission rate in the fuel rod to the average U 2 3 5 fission rate in the fuel rod (628); and the effective resonance integral of U 2 3 8 in a fuel rod (ER 12 8). The results of an investigation of systematic errors associated with these measurements have-led to many changes and adjustments in the experimental techniques and procedure which have improved the general precision of the experimental results. A new method was developed to measure the ratio C * which simplified the experiment, significantly reduced the experimental uncertainty associated with the measurement, and avoided systematic errors inherent in the method used to measure C* in earlier work. The value of ER 12 8 was also measured by a new method in which the results of measurements made in an epithermal flux which had a 1 /E energy dependence are combined with the results of measurements made in a lattice. The experimental results were combined with theoretical results obtained from the computer programs THERMOS and GAM-I to determine the following reactor physics parameters for each of the three lattices studied: the resonance escape probability, p; the fast fission factor, E; the multiplication factor for an infinite system, k [infinity]; and the initial conversion ratio, C. Methods were developed to measure that portion of the activity of a foil which is due to neutron captures in the resonances in the activation cross section of the foil material. The resonance escape probability was determined by a new method, using the resonance activation date, in which the use of cadmium is not necessary. Statement of responsibility on title-page reads: W.

40|$|Reactor physics {{parameters}} {{were measured}} in eleven two-region subcritical assemblies moderated by heavy water. The {{regions of the}} assemblies consisted of nine different lattices of various fuel rod size, U 235 enrichment, and spacing. The following parameters were measured in the assemblies: bare and cadmium-covered gold foil radial traverses; bare gold foil axial traverses; the ratio of <b>epicadmium</b> to subcadmium capture r tes in U 238 (P 28); and the ratio of fissions in U 238 to fissions in U 233 (628) - From analysis of axial traverses at various radial positions, {{it was determined that}} the axial buckling was independent of radial position in the assemblies. A method was developed to apply the age equation to the experimental gold foil traverses. This analysis yielded the quantity [ [...] . ] for each region of the assemblies. Calculated values of [ [...] . ] were used to obtain values of the infinite multiplication factor from this parameter. For assemblies of sufficiently large inner regions, the values of km so found agreed within experimental uncertainty with independent determinations. The slowing-down spectra. arising from the age theory analysis were used to extrapolate two-region assembly measurements of P 28 to critical assembly values. General agreement was found between these extrapolated values and the results of measurements made in full, single region lattices. The heterogeneous expressions for uncollided flux derived by Pilat were extended to two-region assemblies and used to determine single rod values of 628 from two-region assembly measurements. The theory was also used to predict values of 628 for each of the lattices composing the two-region assemblies. Both the single rod values and the full lattice predictions agreed within experimental error with previously reported results. The determination of material buckling from two-region subcritical assemblies is also discussed. !Because {{of the nature of the}} assemblies investigated, satisfactory measurements of the material buckling could not be made.
