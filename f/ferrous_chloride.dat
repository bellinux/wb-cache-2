This followed concerns about its safety {{in the light of}} the increasing size and frequency of occurrence of longitudinal cracks in the webs of the beams, the cracks appearing to follow the trajectory of the post-tensioning tendons. Corrosion was suspected. Pre-demolition testing had not provided sufficient information for estimates to be made of the remaining capacity of the bridge. After demolition, three bridge beams were selected for very detailed evaluation. The load capacity of the most severely damaged beam was only half that of the apparently sound beam. It failed catastrophically. The more seriously damaged beams showed severe loss of ductility. Progressive failure of the strands in the tendons was recorded in each case. The corrosion of the conventional reinforcement was consistent with expectations.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate wastewater quality and the efficiency of removal of wastewater contaminants produced by a tile factory by using ferric <b>chloride,</b> <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, ferric sulfate, aluminum sulfate (alum) and poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) coagulants. Materials and Methods: This is an applied study. A composite sample was taken of the wastewater production line of the factory. Wastewater characteristics including pH, EC, temperature, turbidity, TSS, TDS, TS and COD were measured in accordance with the standard methods. In the next step, the jar-test experiment was used to investigate the effect of changing doses of coagulants (0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 25, 0. 3, 0. 35 g/L) and pH values (7, 9, 11) on the removal of contaminants. The effective dose and optimal pH were thus selected and the best coagulant was later determined. Results: The optimum pH of 11 was obtained for removal of contaminants by ferric <b>chloride,</b> ferric, <b>ferrous</b> sulfate and 7 for alum and PAC. The optimum concentration of the five coagulants was obtained at 0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 25, 0. 25 g/L respectively. PAC, with the turbidity removal EC, TSS, TS and COD removal of 99. 92 %, 17. 74 %, 99. 93 %, 89. 8 %, 75 % respectively, had best performance at lower doses and alum, <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, <b>chloride,</b> ferric and ferric sulfate were placed in the next rankings. Conclusion: Among the five studied coagulants, PAC is the most effective coagulant, and then alum, <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, ferric <b>chloride</b> and ferric sulfate are placed. Given that PAC is more expensive than other materials, care should be taken to select the most appropriate coagulant.  ...|$|R

To obtain porous Si with different morphology, wafers of varying resistivity (ρ) ranging from 0.01 to 100 Ω-cm were used. The concentration ratios of HF/DMF, formation current density (J), etching time (t) were also varied to obtain porous layers having different porosity. SPIONs were synthesized by chemical co-precipitation of ferrous and ferric ion. Briefly, ferric and <b>ferrous</b> <b>chlorides</b> were dissolved in 2 M HCl in 2 : 1 (w/w) ratio and bare iron oxide was obtained by addition of 1.5 M NaOH. All steps were performed under nitrogen environment. The formed black precipitate was washed several times by de-ionized (DI) water through magnetic decantation to remove excess ions. Then the precipitate was re-dispersed in citrate buffer of pH 4 and finally pH was adjusted to 7 to form aqueous stable colloidal SPION solution. The as-synthesized SPIONs were loaded onto the desired porous Si chips by placing the porous template in a dense aqueous solution of SPIONs under magnetic incubation for 24 h. An external magnetic field of 70 Gauss was applied so as to drive the SPIONs inside the pores. This was repeated twice, first without disturbing the system and secondly, by spraying DI water on the chip at certain intervals during magnetic incubation so that the particles can penetrate inside the pores without adhering on the surface only, due to drying up of the aqueous SPION solution.|$|R

40|$|Operating {{conditions}} such as load and speed of compressors are getting more aggressive to improve efficiency. Also, protection from beneficial surface layers, such as <b>ferrous</b> <b>chlorides,</b> on the critical interfaces is compromised as the refrigerants industry is moving from traditional (CFC/HFC) to environmentally friendly refrigerants. Thus, {{there is a need}} to have a closer look at the critical tribo-contacts and devise ways to make them more robust and wear-resistant. In this work, first of its kind studies were done to evaluate the possibility of using surface texturing for realistic gray cast iron compressor surfaces. Three types of micro-dimple patterns (40 ??m diameter and 10 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 7. 5 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 4 ??m depth) with two area densities of 5 % and 20 % were created on the pin surfaces by the method of laser surface texturing. The results of the controlled tribological experiments with the texture patterns were compared against untextured surfaces under starved lubrication conditions. Under identical conditions of load, the untextured pins failed while all the textured pins operated successfully. In addition, the textured pins survived the entire duration of three hours in durability type studies highlighting their long term usefulness. Selected tests were also done at different sliding speeds, lubricant types and refrigerants and the usefulness of surface texturing at aggressive conditions was realized. For the wear and durability experiments, the beneficial effect of the micro-dimples could be attributed to the lubricant storage ability. A trade-off between the effect of the material pile-ups or bulges around the micro-dimples and the lubricant storage volume of the micro-dimples determined the difference in performance between the texture patterns. In addition, step loading scuffing experiments were done using the texture patterns and the scuffing resistance was found to primarily depend on the lubricant storage ability of the micro-dimples. Even though surface texturing was found to have a positive effect, such behavior needs to be evaluated under specific lubricants and refrigerants, to fully understand the complex phenomena driving the improved performance. Overall, the research work done in this thesis developed new information about the application of surface texturing for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor applications. It was demonstrated successfully that texturing could be applied to compressor surfaces operating under realistic {{conditions such}} as starved lubrication and provide significant tribological benefits...|$|R
