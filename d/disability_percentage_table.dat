40|$|Background: The ongoing {{worldwide}} {{phenomenon of}} {{a shortage of}} about 4. 3 million nurses and midwives {{poses a threat to}} health service delivery. Limpopo province had the worst nurse shortage of over 60 % in 2010. Authors attribute this shortage to turnover of nurses. The quest to describe factors contributing to nurses’ turnover led to this study in Limpopo province,South Africa. Objectives: To explore and describe factors that contribute to nurses’ turnover in Limpopo province of South Africa by assessing public sector nurses’ job satisfaction in relation to common determinants of job satisfaction. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional approach used primary quantitative data collected from 141 of 380 respondents (31. 1 % response rate) contacted incidentally. Self-administered hand delivered questionnaires were used to gather ordinal data, which were analysed in terms off requency and <b>percentage</b> <b>tables</b> using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 6. The sum of positive and negative effects was used to determine satisfaction; if positive effects were greater than negative effects respondents were judged to be satisfied and vice versa. Results: Frequency and <b>percentage</b> <b>tables</b> revealed that nurses in Limpopo province were more dissatisfied (53. 9 %) than satisfied (37. 8 %) with their jobs. Factors which respondents were found to be dissatisfied with included staffing (85. 2 %), availability of workplace resources(83. 7 %), salaries (78. 8 %), workplace safety (73. 7 %), career development opportunities (64. 5 %) and hours of work (47. 6 %). Conclusion: Nurses’ turnover is attributed to nurses’ dissatisfaction with staffing, resources, salaries and workplace safety.

40|$|Because {{neither the}} degree of {{constriction}} of the spinal canal considered to be symptomatic for lumbar spinal stenosis nor {{the relationship between the}} clinical appearance and {{the degree of}} a radiologically verified constriction is clear, a correlation of patient’s disability level and radiographic constriction of the lumbar spinal canal is of interest. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a relationship between the degree of radiologically established anatomical stenosis and the severity of self-assessed Oswestry Disability Index in patients undergoing surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Sixty-three consecutive patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis who were scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and completed a self-assessment Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire. Quantitative image evaluation for lumbar spinal stenosis included the dural sac cross-sectional area, and qualitative evaluation of the lateral recess and foraminal stenosis were also performed. Every patient subsequently answered the national translation of the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire and the <b>percentage</b> <b>disability</b> was calculated. Statistical analysis of the data was performed to seek a relationship between radiological stenosis and <b>percentage</b> <b>disability</b> recorded by the Oswestry Disability Index. Upon radiological assessment, 27 of the 63 patients evaluated had severe and 33 patients had moderate central dural sac stenosis; 11 had grade 3 and 27 had grade 2 nerve root compromise in the lateral recess; 22 had grade 3 and 37 had grade 2 foraminal stenosis. On the basis of the <b>percentage</b> <b>disability</b> score, of the 63 patients, 10 patients demonstrated mild disability, 13 patients moderate disability, 25 patients severe disability, 12 patients were crippled and three patients were bedridden. Radiologically, eight patients with severe central stenosis and nine patients with moderate lateral stenosis demonstrated only minimal <b>disability</b> on <b>percentage</b> Oswestry <b>Disability</b> Index scores. Statistical evaluation of central and lateral radiological stenosis versus Oswestry <b>Disability</b> Index <b>percentage</b> scores showed no significant correlation. In conclusion, lumbar spinal stenosis remains a clinico-radiological syndrome, and both the clinical picture and the magnetic resonance imaging findings are important when evaluating and discussing surgery with patients having this diagnosis.
