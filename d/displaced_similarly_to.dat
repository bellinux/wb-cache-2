40|$|The {{renewal of}} protein in retinal rods and cones has been {{analyzed}} by quantitative electron microscope radioautography in adult frogs injected {{with a mixture}} of radioactive amino acids. Protein synthesis occurs predominantly in the ergastoplasm, localized in the myoid region of the photoreceptor cells. Much of the newly formed protein next flows through the Golgi complex. In rods, {{a large proportion of the}} protein then moves past the mitochondria of the ellipsoid segment, passes through the connecting cilium into the outer segment, and is there assembled into membranous discs at the base of that structure. Discs are formed at the rate of 36 per day in red rods and 25 per day in green rods at 22. 5 ° C ambient temperature. In cones, a small proportion of the protein is <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> <b>to</b> the outer segment. However, no new discs are formed. Instead, the protein becomes diffusely distributed throughout the cone outer segment. Low levels of radioactivity have been detected, shortly after injection, in the mitochondria, nucleus, and synaptic bodies of rods and cones. Nevertheless, in these organelles, the renewal process also appears to involve the utilization of protein formed in the ergastoplasm of the myoid...|$|R
5000|$|Late {{into the}} 20th century, Foggy Bottom {{witnessed}} a drastic change in demographics. There was a racial transformation within the area, {{as a white}} revival emerged. Many different factors forced out the black population, including the Foggy Bottom Taxpayers Protective Association opposing federal intervention. The renovations enacted by the Alley Dwelling Authority rendered the former inhabitants <b>displaced.</b> <b>Similarly,</b> the West End witnessed the same changes. Another factor {{of the change in}} demographics was orchestrated by Theodore G. Bilbo, who called for an [...] "Alley Moving Day" [...] forcing the black population out of the alleys.|$|R

40|$|The Indian Ocean tsunami of December, 2004 {{was one of}} {{the most}} severe natural {{disasters}} in human history and resulted in extensive relocation by people living in damaged areas. We describe post-tsunami geographic mobility in the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra in Indonesia, the area worst-affected by the tsunami. Data from a unique longitudinal survey of 10, 000 households who were interviewed both before and after the tsunami are used to quantify and map various dimensions of mobility and to provide insights into the individual, household and contextual factors that influence mobility. Levels of mobility increased dramatically with the extent of tsunami damage. Displacement from heavily damaged areas occurred primarily beyond the community of origin. Results from multivariate statistical models indicate that in damaged areas individuals were <b>displaced</b> <b>similarly</b> across demographic and socioeconomic lines, and that semi-voluntary decisions about mobility were influenced by household assets and prior livelihood strategies...|$|R
