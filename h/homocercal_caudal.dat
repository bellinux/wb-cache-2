Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, {{due to their}} evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. This is because the shark's vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a <b>homocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin.|$|E

This <b>homocercal</b> type of <b>caudal</b> fin ensures powerful and complex locomotion and is {{regarded as one of}} the most important innovations for teleosts during adaptive radiation in an aquatic environment [4 – 6]. However, the mechanisms that create asymmetric caudal fin remain largely unknown. The spontaneous medaka (teleost fish) mutant, Double anal fin (Da), exhibits a unique symmetrical caudal skeleton that resembles the diphycercal type seen in Polypterus and Coelacanth. We performed a detailed analysis of the Da mutant to obtain molecular insight into caudal fin morphogenesis. We first demonstrate that a large transposon, inserted into the enhancer region of the zic 1 and zic 4 genes (zic 1 /zic 4) in Da, is associated with the mesoderm-specific loss of their transcription. We then show that zic 1 /zic 4 are strongly expressed in the dorsal part of the ural mesenchyme and thereby induce asymmetric caudal fin development in wild-type embryos, whereas their expression is lost in Da. Comparative analysis further indicates that the dorsal mesoderm expression of zic 1 /zic 4 is conserved in teleosts, highlighting the crucial role of zic 1 /zic 4 in caudal fin morphogenesis...|$|R
5000|$|Tetras {{generally}} have compressed (sometimes deep), [...] bodies and are typically identifiable by their fins. They ordinarily possess a <b>homocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail fin whose {{upper and lower}} lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal fin characterized by a short connection to the fish’s body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal fin stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal fin and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose fin located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal fins. This adipose fin represents the fourth unpaired fin on the fish (the four unpaired fins include the caudal fin, dorsal fin, anal fin, and adipose fin), lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four. While this adipose fin is generally considered the distinguishing feature, some tetras (such as the emperor tetras, Nematobrycon palmeri) lack this appendage. Ichthyologists debate {{the function of the}} adipose fin, doubting its role in swimming due to its small size and lack of stiffening rays or spines.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow perch {{is often}} {{recognized}} by its dark vertical stripes and gold or yellow body color. Perca {{is derived from}} early Greek for [...] "perch" [...] and flavescens is Latin for [...] "becoming gold" [...] or [...] "yellow colored". Adult sizes typically range from 3.9-11.4 in (10-30 cm); though {{have been known to}} grow larger. The yellow perch has a laterally compressed body with an oval, oblong shape. The anal fins are a green or yellow-orange, the dorsal fin is an olive color, and the belly is cream-colored. The vertical bands fade as they near the belly. Spawning intensifies the bands in males, and they can be nonexistent in juveniles. The spiny anterior dorsal fin has 13 to 15 spines. The soft rear fins also have one or two spines, but which are mostly made up of rays that range from 12 to 15 in number. The pelvic fins are close together, and the <b>homocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin is forked. The operculum tip has one spine, and the anal fin has two spines. There are seven to eight branchiostegal rays. Yellow perch has many fine and sharp teeth. They are rough to the touch because of their ctenoid scales. Common names for the perch are yellow perch, American perch, and lake perch. Yellow perch are one of the smaller-sized members of the perch family (Percidae). Due to its ability to crossbreed and the similar morphology, the yellow perch is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the European perch.For over 100 years, Canada and the United States have been commercially harvesting yellow perch in the Great Lakes with trapnets, gillnets, and poundnets. In Canada, the estimated catch in 2002 was 3,622 tons with a value of $16.7 million, second only to walleye at $28.2 million. The greatest demand in the United States is in the north-central region, where nearly 70% of all yellow perch sales in the US occur within 80 km (49.7 mi) of the Great Lakes. Yellow perch is one of the easiest fish to catch, and can be taken in all seasons, and tastes great. Therefore, it is a desirable sport fish in some locations of the US and Canada. It even makes up around 85% of the sport fish caught in Lake Michigan.|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{advantages}} of realizing repeatable experiments, collecting data and isolating key factors, the bio-robotic model {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the study of}} biomechanics. The caudal fin of fish has long been understood to be central to propulsion performance, yet its contribution to manoeuverability, especially for <b>homocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin, has not been studied in depth. In the research outlined in this paper, we designed and fabricated a robotic caudal fin to mimic the morphology and the three-dimensional (3 D) locomotion of the tail of the Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We applied heave and pitch motions to the robot to model the movement of the caudal peduncle of its biological counterpart. Force measurements and 2 D and 3 D digital particle image velocimetry were then conducted under different movement patterns and flow speeds. From the force data, we found the addition of the 3 D caudal fin locomotion significantly enhanced the lift force magnitude. The phase difference between the caudal fin ray and peduncle motion was a key factor in simultaneously controlling the thrust and lift. The increased flow speed had a negative impact on the generation of lift force. From the average 2 D velocity field, we observed that the vortex wake directed water both axially and vertically, and formed a jet like structure with notable wake velocity. The 3 D instantaneous velocity field at 0. 6 T indicated the 3 D motion of the caudal fin may result in asymmetry wake flow patterns relative to the mid-sagittal plane and change the heading direction of the shedding vortexes. Based on these results, we hypothesized that live fish may actively tune the movement between the caudal fin rays and the peduncle to change the wake structure behind the tail and hence obtain different thrust and lift forces, which contributes to its high manoeuvrability...|$|E
