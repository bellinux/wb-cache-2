5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E

50|$|At {{specific}} {{points on}} Mercury's surface, an observer {{would be able}} to see the Sun rise part way, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same Mercurian day. This apparent retrograde motion of the Sun occurs because, from approximately <b>four</b> Earth <b>days</b> <b>before</b> perihelion until approximately <b>four</b> Earth <b>days</b> after it, Mercury's angular orbital speed exceeds its angular rotational velocity. Mercury's elliptical orbit is farther from circular than that of any other planet in the Solar System, resulting in a substantially higher orbital speed near perihelion.|$|R
