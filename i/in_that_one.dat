5|$|Monody {{is similar}} to melody-dominated {{homophony}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> voice becomes the melody, while another voice assumes the underlying harmony. Monody, however, {{is characterized by a}} single voice with instrumental accompaniment, whereas melody-dominated homophony refers to a broader category of homophonic music, which includes works for multiple voices, not just works for solo voice, as was the tradition with early 17th-century Italian monody.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

5|$|Linde {{made his}} major league debut with the Indians on September 11, 1947, which {{ended up being}} his only {{appearance}} of the season. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> appearance, he pitched ⅔ of an inning and allowed two earned run, finishing the game and season with an ERA of 27.00. During the off-season, Linde played basketball with the Olo Soaps, a team located in his native Beaver Dam. He took part in spring training {{with the rest of}} the Indians roster for the 1948 Cleveland Indians season. In late March, however, he was struck on the chin from a line drive hit by Indians manager Lou Boudreau, causing him to be sidelined for several days. By the end of spring training, Linde remained a part of the Indians roster. He pitched three games for the Indians early on in 1948, pitching ten innings, allowing six earned runs and finishing the season with a 5.40 ERA. After three games, he was demoted to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He spent the rest of the 1948 season as a starting pitcher for Baltimore. His performances included a one-hit victory in his first appearance for the club. Linde finished the season with a 5–9 record and a 4.50 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Marie Eline was cast in the film, likely as the newspaper boy. Eline had previously played a newspaper boy in Not Guilty. The role of the flower girl has been claimed to be Frances Gibson by an answer column in Motion Picture Story Magazine. This is disputable because Gibson is known only to have a single credit with the Thanhouser Company, in the 1912 release of Nicholas Nickleby. Around this time Gibson was appearing in Solax Studios productions. Both immediate before and after her only Thanhouser credit, Gibson was employed by Solax, leading Bowers to speculate that her appearance <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> film may have been as a special project. A different film still shows William Russell and opens the possibility of identifying the other actors. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E

25|$|A rigid lens is able {{to replace}} the natural shape of the contact (cornea) with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct astigmatism. Rigids can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. This is {{different}} from a spherical contact lens <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> or both surfaces of the lens deliver a toric correction. Rigids can also correct for corneal irregularities, such as keratoconus. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigids than through glasses. Rigids are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.|$|E
25|$|Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556): St. Ignatius had {{a number}} of mystical {{experiences}} in his life, the most significant was an experience of enlightenment by the river Cardoner, in which, he later stated, he learnt more <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> occasion than he did in the rest of his life. Another significant mystical experience was in 1537, at a chapel in La Storta, outside Rome, in which he saw God the Father place him with the Son, who was carrying the Cross. This was after he had spent a year praying to Mary for her to place him with her Son (Jesus), {{and was one of the}} reasons why he insisted that the group that followed his 'way of proceeding' be called the Society of Jesus.|$|E

The lack of European troops at Yen Bai – aside from Massimi's and Le Tacon's personal failures – had been pinpointed {{as the cause of}} the mutiny. The proposal held that if the local commanding officer had more European troops at his disposal, their presence would have deterred the Vietnamese soldiers from taking part in the mutiny. Although this was plausible <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> {{of the leaders of the}} mutiny had attempted to foment his Vietnamese colleagues by pointing to the weak French presence, this internal argument overlooked the haphazard command and security procedures that had left Yen Bai vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|A stadimeter, a type {{of optical}} rangefinder, is an optical device for {{estimating}} the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between {{the top and bottom}} of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> dials in the height of the object. The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.|$|E

25|$|Symbolic {{communication}} systems are distinguished from writing systems <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> must usually understand {{something of the}} associated spoken language to comprehend the text. In contrast, symbolic systems, such as information signs, painting, maps, and mathematics, often do not require prior knowledge of a spoken language. Every human community possesses language, a feature regarded by many as an innate and defining condition of mankind (see Origin of language). However the development of writing systems, and their partial supplantation of traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven, and slow. Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts and often preserve features and expressions that no longer exist in the spoken language. The greatest benefit of writing is that it provides the tool by which society can record information consistently and in greater detail, something {{that could not be}} achieved as well previously by spoken word. Writing allows societies to transmit information and to share knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Homer {{relates the}} events of Polypites birth and the attack of the centaurs, when the ritual {{procession}} to gift a girdle in the sanctuary of Artemis is interrupted. While nearing the sanctuary, the procession is set upon by a gang of centaurs, precipitating a brawl, much as had happened at the wedding feast. The first slab of the Centauromachy, BM 526, focuses {{on a pair of}} Greeks clad in mantles and fighting barehanded. Although they face in opposite directions, their poses are nearly identical, differing only <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>one,</b> BM 526:2, folds his lower left leg under the thigh as he kneels {{on the back of his}} adversary. On the next slab, BM 524, the goal of the procession, the ritual sanctuary of Artemis, is indicated by a tree hung with a lion or panther skin in thanksgiving for a successful hunt. The Greek (BM 524:1) who defends the two women against the centaur has no attributes save for the weapon that was held in his right hand. The roughly cut form that extends from the bottom of the fist seems to be the stump of a club. Into the top of the fist is fitted a metal club, requiring a stronger anchor than did the bronze swords attached to fists elsewhere. The hole for the club is therefore twice as wide and deep as those used for swords. This club identifies the hero as Theseus. The two victims of the centaur flank a small statue of Artemis. The axis of the statue is slightly off vertical, for it is not fixed to a base but carried by the priestess, BM 524:3. No base is actually seen, and the poses of the two women preclude there being one behind them. The left leg of the woman who gestures with extended arms, BM 524:4, reaches backward below the statue, where the base would be. The woman who holds the statue, BM 524:3, wraps her peplos around part of its back. As the centaur pulls the garment off her proper left shoulder, it passes behind her neck but does not appear between her nude torso and the statue. It reappears in the priestess’s left hand, being drawn from the left, up and to the right. As a result, it must be understood as partially encompassing the lower parts of the statue.|$|E
