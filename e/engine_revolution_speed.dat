50|$|The Octavia RS, {{available}} {{in both the}} hatchback and estate body styles, was premiered at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2013. It features the 162 kW (220 PS) 2.0 TSI engine from the newly launched Golf 7 GTI and the 135 kW (184 PS) 2.0 TDI engine from the Golf 7 GTD. With top speed 248 km/h, the Octavia RS with petrol engine and manual gearbox was acclaimed to be the fastest production Octavia ever. In comparison with standard car, the sports Octavia features progressive steering (variable-ratio steering), sports chassis, electronic differential lock (XDS) and so-called ‘Performance Sound Generator‘, that enhances sporty sound of the engine. The source of sound vibrations is the electromagnetic pulse generator placed in the area under/in front of the windshield. The sound vibrations are spreading into the car’s cabin through {{the body and the}} windshield. The frequency and intensity of the sound is dependent not only on the profile chosen, but also the <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions,</b> driving <b>speed</b> and <b>engine</b> load (the throttle pedal position). The generated sound is directed inside the cabin, especially to the front seat area. Skoda used the 2015 Geneva motor show to shine the spotlight on its new and more powerful Octavia RS 230. The car has 230 PS (10 PS more than stock) and this helps it shave a tenth off its benchmark sprint time and adds 2 km/h to the car’s top speed which increases to 250 km/h (155 mph); it also gets a standard electronic differential in this version and lower, stiffer springs.|$|R

40|$|Shorter product {{development}} cycles, densely packed engine compartments and intensified noiselegislation increase {{the need for}} accurate predictions of IC-engine air intake noise at earlystages. The urgent focus on the increasing CO 2 emissions and the efficiency of IC-engines, aswell as new techniques such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mightworsen the noise situation. Nonlinear one-dimensional (1 D) gas dynamics time-domainsimulation software packages are used within the automotive industry to predict intake andexhaust orifice noise. The inherent limitation of 1 D plane wave propagation, however, limitsthis technique to sufficiently low frequencies where non-plane wave effects are small. Thereforethis type of method will first fail in large components such as air cleaners. Further limitations,that might not be important for simulation of engine performance but indeed for acoustics,include difficulties to apply frequency dependent boundary conditions and losses as well as toinclude effects of vibrating walls. The {{first part of this}} thesis treats two different strategies to combine nonlinear and linearmodelling of intake systems in order to improve the accuracy of the noise predictions. Paper Adescribes how a linear time-invariant one-port source model can be extracted using nonlineargas dynamics simulations. Predicted source data for a six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine isvalidated using experimental data obtained from engine test bench measurements. Paper Bpresents an experimental investigation on the influence of mean flow and filter paper on theacoustics of air intake systems. It also suggests how a linear source, extracted from nonlinearsimulations can be coupled to acoustic finite elements describing the intake system and toboundary elements describing the radiation to the surroundings. Simulations and measurementsare carried out for a large number of <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>speeds</b> {{in order to make the}} firstsystematic validation of an entirely virtual intake noise model that includes 3 D effects for awide engine speed range. In Paper C an initial study on a new technique for the use of two-portsin the time domain for automotive gas dynamics applications is presented. Tabulated frequencydomaintwo-port data representing an air cleaner unit on the impedance form is inverselytransformed to the time domain and used as FIR filters in nonlinear time-domain calculations. The second part of the thesis considers detailed modelling of sound propagation in capillarytubes. Thermoviscous boundary effects and interaction between sound waves and turbulencecan, for sufficiently narrow tubes, yield significant attenuation. Several components in the gasexchange system of IC-engines are based on arrays of narrow ducts and might haveunderestimated silencing capabilities. In particular the sound transmission properties of chargeair coolers (CAC) have so far gained interest from very few authors. In Paper D a detailedinvestigation of the acoustic properties of CACs is presented. As a result the first linearfrequency-domain model for CACs, which includes a complete treatment of losses in the narrowtubes and 3 D effects in the connecting tanks, is proposed. Interesting low frequency dampingmost likely due to interaction between sound and turbulence is observed in the experimentaldata. A new numerical model that describes this dissipative effect in narrow tubes is suggestedin Paper E. Validation is carried out using experimental data from the literature. Finally, inPaper F the CAC-model presented in Paper D is updated with the new model for interactionbetween turbulence and acoustic waves proposed in Paper E. The updated model is shown toyield improved predictions. QC 2010072...|$|R

3000|$|In this study, strains {{that are}} caused by wood-based panels on {{horizontal}} milling machines and other cutting devices were examined. In order to fulfill this aim, samples of wood-based panels such as particleboard, medium density fiberboard (MDF), blockboard, okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) plywood, poplar (Populus × euramericana) plywood, and oriented strand board (OSB) were examined. The strains that milling machines and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an amperemeter using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different engine revolution speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min). Using the experimental data and the data derived from wood-based panels, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>speed,</b> and drive forward speed, several regression equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains {{for each of the}} wood-based panels. As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, blockboard, and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity.

30|$|During the planing {{process in}} which the <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>speed</b> and drive forward speed were high, the {{electrical}} current was seen to increase and the panels were seen to show a higher strain against the machine and the engine. In order not to over-wear the engine and the cutters using an unnecessary amount of current that can increase electrical consumption, {{it is important not to}} use the engine at high revolution when not needed. If the desired quality of the wood-based panel can be achieved at a slower speed then there is no need to use the engine and the cutters at higher speeds. If the manufacturers choose wood-based panels that are found to be more efficient according to this experiment, they will easily decrease their electricity consumption and machinery, engine, and cutter wear.|$|E
30|$|When {{the engine}} {{revolution}} or drive forward speed was increased, the strain was also seen to increase. This {{is thought to}} have resulted from the increase in the work (planed sawdust) to be done on each cutting teeth in a unit of time [8, 28]. In addition to this fact there are some other several facts, which were stated in the literature, that must be taken into consideration such as the increase in strains cannot be said to have resulted from the necessary current quantity as it can also be said to result from the necessary power needed by the engine to realize its own revolution. This fact also complies with what is stated in the literature [9, 13]. In the experiments we carried out the cutters were examined under high and low cutting speeds to see the different results. When the cutting speed is high, it is thought that the cutters realize the cutting work without undergoing a high strain and without experiencing a break on the fibers by having a shocking effect. In other words, the cutters and the machine have to have more inaction power to get easily over even the highest strains shown by the wood-based panels. Power, speed, and the factors related to it can be said to affect the power directly [29]. When the cutting speed is low, the breakings of the fibers on the surface are seen to be high during planing, which testifies the fact that when speed is low the breakings of the fibers are to be high. It is also thought that during planing with breakings of the fibers, the cutting end is exposed to friction under pressure with the fibers (sawdust) over a longer period. As a result, it can be stated that under this kind of a circumstance, the material causes a higher strain on the machine and the cutters thereby need a higher electrical current. This shows that there is a strong interaction between drive forward speed, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> <b>speed,</b> and the type of wood-based panel, which is in agreement with the literature [5, 7, 10].|$|E

With this model, calculation of crankshaft stresses and displacements is possible. Then, simulations are made with engine speed variations to evaluate the effect of inertia. Due to the complex shape of the crankshaft, the CPU time and computer resources can be important. As simulations with a variable rotation speed have to be carried out on a larger number of <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions,</b> it becomes difficult to work with the fully detailed crankshaft geometry.
