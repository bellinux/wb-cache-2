40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the nominal and verbal {{morphology}} of Assamese {{and the role}} of indexed markedness constraints in accounting for these exceptions. Assamese vowel harmony is a 'directional' right-to-left regressive harmony system, which normally ignores morphological boundaries. In contrast to the general process of harmony, this work shows that some morphemes can influence vowel harmony and result in exceptional patterns. Following Pater (2006) it is shown that indexation of markedness constraints can account for these <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences.</b> This work also shows that the caveat in Pater (2006) about such constraints' ability to subvert the universal constraint ranking ROOT FAITH >> AFFIX FAITH is indeed borne true. Consequently, the Assamese examples show that indexed constraints lead to an exceptional alternation where [±Back] harmony occurs only in the root and the suffixal [±Back] values remain unaltered. I argue that this reversal is a result of confluence of several factors leading to the theoretically motivated observation that some unexpected processes in OT may be emergent. The paper also deals with another exceptional pattern where the combined outcome of vowel harmony and a morphological requirement of avoiding vowel-vowel sequences results in an exceptional pattern of syllabification. Contextualising these occurrences to the need for indexed markedness constraints, it is shown that the indexation of *HIATUS is able to analyse these occurrences. Furthermore, it is shown that hiatus avoidance can be the result of varying markedness requirements and it need not be the result of a single motivation of unmarkedness dictated by the overarching grammatical structure. *HIATUS is satisfied by both epenthesis as well as vowel deletion, and in one instance a morpheme even prefers a hiatal situation over non-hiatus. The <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> show that markedness requirements and reversals may be often emergent, and therefore a result of a particular relation that a specific morpheme construes to be the least marked...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe regular {{realm of}} vowel harmony in Assamese {{consists}} of right-to-left regressive [ATR] harmony. In contrast with this regular pattern of vowel harmony, the exceptional Assamese processes {{dealt with in}} this paper are symptomatic {{of the behavior of}} a pair of morphemes that trigger additional processes not seen elsewhere in the language. This pair of morphemes allows raising of the otherwise opaque vowel // and fronting/backing of // depending on the [Back] quality of a mid vowel adjacent to //. Raising is strictly local in the presence of preceding high and low vowels, but there is also another pattern which shows backness assimilation to a previous vowel if there are mid vowels preceding the // of the input. This exceptional raising occurs to allow [ATR] harmony to spread regressively by changing the [–ATR] low vowel into a [+ATR] mid vowel. I analyse these cases within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993 / 2004) and show that these <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> are morpheme-specific. It is also shown that these <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> lend themselves to an account based on indexation of markedness constraints (Flack 2007; Ota 2004; Pater 2000, 2006, 2009). Consequently, the Assamese examples show that indexed markedness constraints are able to deal with an exceptional alternation where a low vowel undergoes harmony locally. This article also shows that an emergence of the unmarked analysis is required to account for the low back vowel that alternates with a front vowel if there is a preceding front vowel. This article goes beyond the problems encountered in Assamese, and claims that {{there is no need to}} invoke locality in exceptional blocking in vowel harmony, as both exceptional and non-exceptional blocking in vowel harmony are always local and bounded. The goal of this paper is to shed light on exceptional and emergent processes, arguing that they are always local and governed by strong universal properties of grammar...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} pattern mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} important researches and a major concern in data mining. The significant patterns are very useful since it can reveal a new dimension of knowledge in certain domain applications. There are three categories of significant patterns named frequent patterns, least patterns and significant least patterns. Typically, these patterns may derive from the absolute frequent patterns or mixed up with the least patterns. In market-basket analysis, frequent patterns are considered as significant patterns and already make a lot of contribution. Frequent Pattern Tree (FP-Tree) {{is one of the}} famous data structure to deal with batched frequent patterns but it must rely on the original database. For detecting the <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> or events that have a high implication such as unanticipated substances that cause air pollution, unexpected degree programs selected by students, unpredictable motorcycle models preferred by customers; the least patterns are very meaningful as compared to the frequent one. However, in this category of patterns, the generation of standard tree data structure may trigger the memory overflow due to the requirement of lowering the minimum support threshold. Furthermore, the classical support-confidence measure has many limitations such as tricky in choosing the right support-confidence value, misleading interpretation based on support-confidence combination and not scalable enough to deal with significant least patterns. Therefore, to overcome these drawbacks, in this thesis we proposed a Hybrid Model for Discovering Significant Patterns (Hy-DSP) which consist of the combination of Efficient Frequent Pattern Mining Model (EFP-M 2), Efficient Least Pattern Mining Model (ELP-M 2) and Significant Least Pattern Mining Model (SLP-M 2). The proposed model is developed using the latest. NET framework and C# as a programming language. Experiments with the UCI datasets showed that the Hy-DSP which consist of DOSTrieIT and LP-Growth* outperformed the benchmarked CanTree and FP-Growth up to 4. 13 times (75. 78 %) and 10. 37 times (90. 31 %), respectively, thus verify its efficiency.

The list is organised in Classes, Orders and Families according to Nelson (1994). The scientific names are, for the most part, those used in Fishes of the North-eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (FNAM) (Whitehead et al. 1989), and they are organised in alphabetical order within the families. Clofnam numbers (see Hureau & Monod 1979) are included for reference. Information is given if the species is not cited for the Azores in FNAM. Vernacular names are always both presented in Portuguese (Azorean names) and English. Synonyms, misspellings and misidentifications found in the literature in reference to the occurrence of species in the Azores are also quoted. The 460 species listed, belong to 142 families; 12 species are cited for the first time for the Azores.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of multiculturalism in Slovenia, {{as well as}} in Europe, is nowadays a current topic. In this diploma thesis is multiculturalism explored {{in the context of a}} total institution. This work demonstrates how multiculturalism manifests itself, and what challenges it presents in the case of juveniles in Reeducation Home of Radeče. In the theoretical part, first the term of multiculturalism is described, followed by cultural differences and three aspects of the individual: (national) identity, language and religion. Also the term of intercultural dialogue is introduced. It continues with the description of multicultural image of Slovenia, which is manifested in multilingualism, multinational and migrations, {{as well as in}} religious landscape of population in Slovenia. Furthermore, it is focused on challenges that arise in multicultural society. It defines the terms stereotype, prejudice and discrimination. This part focuses on term juvenile delinquency. There is substantiated re-education measure of detention in re-education facility with the education measures in Slovenia, and finally with the description of Reeducation Home of Radeče. The empirical part of the diploma thesis is focused on juveniles themselves, and with the help of six interviews (with juvenile members of non-majority cultures) tries to gain insight into their experience of belonging to minority culture. Multiculturalism is connected with negative stereotypes and discrimination among the juvenile, by the personnel of the re-education facility and the entire legal system. In the foreground of the entire research is the experience of the juveniles as members of non-majority culture in Slovenia, especially in Reeducation Home of Radeče (minority religion, ethnicity, the fact that a person is an immigrant). The results, gathered with qualitative research demonstrate relatively high rate of intolerance among the juvenile population, especially intolerance of members of other groups towards the members of Roma population. The Roma juveniles are the most excluded and stigmatized ethnic group in the re-education facility, as well as in the Republic of Slovenia. Quite often with the juveniles, the problems of closed institution, and consequently of forced contact of various cultures and their members also emerge. Interviewed report occasional, <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> of discrimination by the professional stuff.

40|$|Continental shelves {{represent}} {{areas of}} highest economical and ecological importance. Nevertheless, these sedimentary systems remain poorly understood {{due to a}} complex interplay of various factors and processes which results in highly individual construction schemes. Previous studies of sedimentary shelf systems have mainly focused on {{a limited number of}} cores, retrieved from Holocene fine-grained depocentres. As such, the relation between shelf architecture and sedimentary history remains largely obscure. Here, we present new data from the NW Iberian shelf comprising shallow-seismic profiles, a large number of sediment cores, and an extended set of radiocarbon dates to reveal the Late Quaternary evolution of a low-accumulation shelf system in detail. On the NW Iberian shelf, three main seismic units are identified. These overly a prominent erosional unconformity on top of the basement. The lowermost Unit 1 is composed of maximal 75 -m thick, Late Tertiary to Pleistocene deposits. The youngest sediments of this unit are related to the last glacial sea-level fall. Unit 2 was controlled by the deglacial sea-level rise and shows a maximum thickness of 15 m. Finally, Unit 3 comprises deposits related to the late stage of sea-level rise and the modern sea-level highstand with a thickness of 4 m in mid-shelf position. Two pronounced seismic reflectors separate these main units from each other. Their origin is related to (1) exposure and ravinement processes during lower sea level, and (2) to reworking and re-deposition of coarse sediments during subsequent sea-level rise. According to the sediment core ground-truthing, sediments of the Late Tertiary to Pleistocene unit predominantly display homogenous fine sands with <b>exceptional</b> <b>occurrences</b> of palaeosols that indicate an ancient exposure surface. Fine sands which were deposited in the run of the last sea-level rise show a time-transgressive retrogradational development. The seismic reflectors, bounding the individual units, appear in the cores as 0. 1 to 1 -m thick deposits consisting either of shell gravels or siliceous coarse sands with gravels. The modern sea-level highstand stage is characterised by zonal deposition of mud forming a mud belt in mid-shelf position, and sediment starvation on outer shelf zones. Radiocarbon ages indicate that this mud belt was the main depocentre for river-supplied fine material on the NW Iberian shelf at least over the past 5. 32 ka BP. The initial onset of this depocentre is proposed to be related to a shift in the balance between rate of sea-level rise and amount of terrigenous sediment supply. Various other stratigraphical shelf reconstructions reveal analogies in architecture which indicate that timing and shaping of the individual units on low-accumulation shelves is fundamentally controlled by eustatic sea-level changes. Other factors of local importance such as differential elevation of the basement and the presence of morphological barriers formed by rocky outcrops on the seafloor have additionally modifying influence on the sedimentary processes...|$|E
