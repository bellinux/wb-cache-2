Marine and terrestrial biologic data-sets (pollen, ostracods, benthic and planktonic foraminifera, coccolithophores, teleostean fishes, mollusks) are compared with the high resolution astronomically-tuned benthic oxygen isotope curve {{in order to provide}} accurate paleonvironmental reconstruction and acquire additional climatostratigraphic and biostratigraphic constraints within a chronostratigraphic framework which also includes the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of three volcaniclastic layers. Environmental and climatic events (e. g. Termination IX, substages 19. 3, 19. 2, and 19. 1, maximum flooding and climate optimum, maximum depth) highlight a succession of clear paleoenvironmental changes close to MIS 19, showing a remarkable correspondence between the response of marine and terrestrial proxies. Such changes have stratigraphic implication and high potential of correlation as they evidence wide scale climate changes, stressing the tight interconnection between the Mediterranean region and North Atlantic Ocean.
