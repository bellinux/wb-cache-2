50|$|Before 2004, all {{previous}} highly pathogenic avian flu (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> strains circulated only among domesticated poultry and by culling {{all of them}} in the area, the strains were made extinct. Previous HPAI strains only existed in domesticated birds. A wild bird's LPAI would mutate in a domestic flock into an HPAI strain, all domestic birds in the area would be killed, and the HPAI strain would no longer have any hosts and thus would no longer exist. This current HPAI H5N1 strain {{has turned out to be}} different. In October 2004 researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than previously believed because waterfowl, especially ducks, were directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic. Nonetheless, there is still hope it will mutate into some low pathogenic strain over time and no longer exist in its current high pathogenic set of strains. But as time has gone on, the hope has come to look less and less likely. The result is that billions of dollars every year are going to be needed in expenditures that would not be required if it did go away. Poultry farming is especially hard hit. How to best spend pandemic mitigation funds and poultry farming protection funds is a question that to be answered requires billions in flu research and new flu vaccine manufacturing factories.|$|E
40|$|Understanding of ecologic factors favoring {{emergence}} {{and maintenance}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses</b> is limited. Although low pathogenic avian influenza viruses persist and evolve in wild populations, <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> evolve in domestic birds and cause economically serious epizootics that only occasionally infect wild populations. We propose that evolutionary ecology considerations can explain this apparent paradox.

Because viral fitness is highly dependent on host survival and dispersal in nature, virulent forms are unlikely to persist in wild populations if they kill hosts quickly or affect predation risk or migratory performance.

Two out of 24 H 5 N 1 -infected voles displayed evident respiratory distress, while H 7 N 1 -infected voles remained asymptomatic. Viable virus was isolated from nasal washes collected from animals infected with both <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses,</b> and extra-pulmonary infection was confirmed in both experimental groups. Histopathological lesions were evident in the respiratory tract of infected animals, although immunohistochemistry positivity was only detected in lungs and trachea of two H 7 N 1 -infected voles.

Pre-existing immunity to AI virus {{has been shown to}} modulate the outcome of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> infection in multiple domestic avian species, but few studies have addressed this effect in wild birds. In this study, the effect of pre-exposure to homosubtypic (homologous hemagglutinin) and heterosubtypic (heterologous hemagglutinin) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses on the outcome of a H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection in wood ducks (Aix sponsa) was evaluated. Pre-exposure of wood ducks to different LPAI viruses did not prevent infection with H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus,</b> but did increase survival associated with H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection. The magnitude of this effect on the outcome of the H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection varied between different LPAI viruses, and was associated both with efficiency of LPAI viral replication in wood ducks {{and the development of a}} detectable humoral immune response.

However {{the evolution of}} a LPAI virus into highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> results in the generation of a virus that can cause severe disease and death. The classification of these two pathotypes is based, in part, on disease signs and death in chickens, as assessed in an intravenous pathogenicity test, but the effect of LPAI viruses in turkeys is less well understood. During an investigation of LPAI virus infection of turkeys, groups of three-week-old birds inoculated with A/chicken/Italy/ 1279 / 99 (H 7 N 1) showed severe disease signs and died or were euthanised within seven days of infection. Virus was detected in many internal tissues and organs from culled birds. To examine the possible evolution of the infecting virus to a highly pathogenic form in these turkeys, sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene cleavage site was carried out by analysing multiple cDNA amplicons made from swabs and tissue sample extracts employing Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing. In addition, a RT-PCR assay to detect <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> was developed.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses {{are highly}} contagious, extremely variable viruses that are widespread in birds. Wild birds in aquatic habitats {{are thought to}} be their natural reservoir hosts, but domesticated poultry and other birds can also be infected. Most viruses cause only mild disease in poultry, and are called low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses</b> can develop from certain LPAI viruses, usually while they are circulating in poultry flocks. <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> can kill up to 90 - 100 % of the flock, and cause epidemics that may spread rapidly, devastate the poultry industry and result in severe trade restrictions. In poultry, the presence of LPAI viruses capable of evolving into <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> can also affect international trade. Avian influenza viruses can occasionally affect mammals, including humans, usually after close contact with infected poultry. While infections in people are often limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some viruses can cause severe illness.

The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a model to back-calculate the day <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> is introduced into a flock, based on within-flock mortality data. The back-calculation method was based on a stochastic SEIR (susceptible (S) - latently infected (E) - infectious (I) - removed (= dead; R)) epidemic model. The latent and infectious period were assumed to be gamma distributed. Parameter values were based on experimental H 7 N 7 within-flock transmission data. The model was used to estimate the day of virus introduction based on a defined within-flock mortality threshold (detection rule for determining AI). Our results indicate that approximately two weeks can elapse before a noticeable increase in mortality is observed after a single introduction into a flock. For example, it takes twelve (minimum 11 - maximum 15) days before AI is detected if the detection rule is fifty dead chickens on two consecutive days in a 10 [*] 000 chicken flock (current Dutch monitoring rule for notification). The results were robust for flock size and detection rule, but sensitive to the length of the latent and infectious periods.

40|$|Duck {{populations are}} {{considered}} to be a reservoir of Highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> H 5 N 1 in some agricultural production systems, as they are able to shed the virus for several days without clinical signs. Countries endemically affected with HPAI in Asia are characterised by production systems where ducks are fed on post-harvest spilled rice. During this scavenging process it is common for ducks to come into contact with other duck flocks or wild birds, thereby providing opportunities for virus spread. Effective risk management for HPAI has been significantly compromised by a limited understanding of management of moving duck flocks in these countries, despite of a small number of recent investigations. Here, for the first time, we described the management of moving duck flocks and the structure of the moving duck flock network in quantitative terms so that factors influencing the risk of HPAIV transmission can be identified. By following moving duck flock farmers over a period of 6 months in Java, Indonesia, we were able to describe the movement of flocks and to characterise the network of various types of actors associated with the production system. We used these data to estimate the basic reproductive number for <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> spread. Our results suggest that focussing HPAI prevention measures on duck flocks alone will not be sufficient. Instead, the role of transporters of moving duck flocks, hatcheries and rice paddy owners, in the spread of the <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> needs to be recognised...|$|E
40|$|Influenza viruses are RNA viruses in {{the family}} Orthomyxoviridae that can affect birds and mammals {{including}} humans. Influenza B and C viruses are maintained only in human populations, although they are isolated occasionally from other mammals. 1 - 9 Influenza A viruses can affect many species, with {{the vast majority of}} these viruses occurring among birds. Waterfowl and shorebirds seem to the reservoir hosts for avian influenza viruses, which are usually carried asymptomatically in these populations. 1, 10 - 17 Avian influenza viruses can also become established among poultry, causing two forms of disease. Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, the form usually carried in wild birds, generally cause asymptomatic infections, mild respiratory disease or decreased egg production in poultry. 11, 13, 14, 18, 19 Some LPAI viruses can mutate in poultry populations to become high pathogenicity avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses.</b> <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> cause a severe illness that can kill up to 90 - 100 % of a flock. 10, 11, 13 A few influenza A viruses have become adapted to mammals including humans, swine, horses and dogs, and circulate in thes...|$|R

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses {{are highly}} contagious, extremely variable viruses that are widespread in birds, particularly wild waterfowl and shorebirds. Most of these viruses, {{which are usually}} carried asymptomatically by wild birds, cause only mild disease in poultry. Others, the high pathogenicity avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses,</b> can kill up to 90 - 100 % of a poultry flock. Epidemics of high pathogenicity avian influenza can spread rapidly, devastate the poultry industry and result in severe trade restrictions. <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> have been eradicated from domesticated poultry in many nations including the U. S.; however, {{these viruses can be}} reintroduced in imported poultry, wild birds or pet birds. Some avian influenza viruses can also infect mammals including humans. The severity of zoonotic avian influenza varies with the virus. Although many human infections are limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some viral strains cause severe disease and death. Generally, avian influenza viruses do not spread efficiently in mammals, and infections are limited to individual animals or small groups. However, some viruses can become adapted to a new species and cause epidemics or pandemics...|$|R
40|$|The poultry {{epidemic}} of H 7 N 7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> in the Netherlands in 2003 {{was probably the}} result of the introduction of an H 7 N 7 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus (by interspecies transmission from wild birds) and the subsequent intraspecies transmission of this virus in poultry. The intraspecies transmission of the ensuing H 7 N 7 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> was very successful both within and between flocks. Consequently, in the two poultry-dense areas that were affected, the epidemic could only be stopped by eliminating all poultry in the region. According to the spatial models these are the only areas where this {{was the case in the}} Netherlands. There was also interspecies transmission to mammals, i. e. to pigs and to humans. For pigs it was shown that possible subsequent intraspecies transmission was negligible (R 0 < 1). With hindsight the same was probably also true for human...|$|E

To develop broadly protective H 5 subunit vaccine, a recombinant consensus HA sequence (rHA) was constructed and expressed in virus-like particles (rHA VLPs) in the baculovirus-insect cell system. The efficacy of the rHA VLPs vaccine with or without immunopotentiator (CVCVA 5) was assessed in chickens. Compared to the commercial Re 6 or Re 6 -CVCVA 5 vaccines, single dose immunization of chickens with rHA VLPs or rHA-CVCVA 5 vaccines induced higher levels of serum hemagglutinin inhibition titers and neutralization titers, mucosal antibodies, IFN-γ and IL- 4 cytokines in sera, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. The rHA VLPs vaccine was superior to the commercial Re 6 vaccine in conferring cross-protection against different clades of H 5 subtype viruses.

40|$|The role of {{wild birds}} in the {{epidemiology}} of the Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> subtype H 5 N 1 epizootic and their contribution {{to the spread of}} the responsible viruses in Eurasia and Africa are unclear. To better understand the potential role of swans and geese in the epidemiology of this virus, we infected 4 species of swans and 2 species of geese with an <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> of Asian lineage recovered from a whooper swan in Mongolia in 2005, A/whooper swan/Mongolia/ 244 / 2005 (H 5 N 1). The highest mortality rates were observed in swans, and species-related differences in clinical illness and viral shedding were evident. These results suggest that the potential for HPAI (H 5 N 1) viral shedding and the movement of infected birds may be species-dependent and can help explain observed deaths associated with HPAI (H 5 N 1) infection in anseriforms in Eurasia. The first indication of wild bird involvement in the Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> (H 5 N 1) epizootic occurred late in 2002 and 2003, when HPAI (H 5 N 1) was isolated from captive and wild birds in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China (1).

To better understand {{the basis of the}} increased pathogenicity of recent Asian H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> in chickens, we compared the fevers and mean death times (MDTs) of chickens infected with the Asian H 5 N 1 A/chicken/Yamaguchi/ 7 / 04 (CkYM 7) strain with those infected with the H 5 N 1 Duck/Yokohama/aq 10 / 03 (DkYK 10) strain, using a wireless thermosensor. Asian H 5 N 1 CkYM 7 caused peracute death in chickens before fever could be induced, whereas DkYK 10 virus induced high fevers and had a long MDT. Real-time PCR analyses of cytokine mRNA expressions showed that CkYM 7 quickly induced antiviral and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expressions at 24 h postinfection (hpi) that suddenly decreased at 32 hpi. In contrast, these cytokine mRNA expressions increased at 24 hpi in the DkYK 10 group, but decreased from 48 hpi onward to levels similar to those resulting from infection with the low-pathogenicity H 5 N 2 A/chicken/Ibaraki/ 1 / 2004 strain. Sequential titrations of viruses in lungs, spleens, and kidneys demonstrated that CkYM 7 replicated rapidly and efficiently in infected chickens and that the viral titers were more than twofold higher than those of DkYK 10. CkYM 7 preferentially and efficiently replicated in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, while DkYK 10 grew moderately in macrophages.
