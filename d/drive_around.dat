5|$|In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater {{built in}} {{what was to be}} the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first {{purpose-built}} Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside <b>Drive.)</b> <b>Around</b> this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.|$|E

5|$|The Rio film unit {{captured}} aerial {{shots of}} the city including Sugarloaf Mountain, Fort Copacabana, Ipanema Beach, the Dona Marta lookout point and the Christ the Redeemer statue. Establishing {{shots of the}} heist team members were taken as each arrived in Rio. Gibson was filmed arriving in character at Galeão International Airport but, when it became publicly known that a scene was being shot at the airport, {{the cast and crew}} were mobbed. A similar situation occurred while Ludacris was shooting a scene in which his character buys a car to <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> the city. A scene where the completed heist team walk down a beach was filmed in Copacabana.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to her clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
5|$|No.1 ITS's inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Wing Commander Wilfred Lampe. Tiger Moths began arriving at Archerfield on 4January 1952, {{and the first}} course commenced two days later. It graduated on 27March, having flown a total of some 1,000 hours. The unit was renamed No.1 Initial Flying Training School on 28May. As well as RAAF pilots, the school trained students from the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and gave Air Training Corps cadets flying experience. Six of its Tiger Moths went on a recruiting <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> Kingaroy and Bundaberg in August 1952, the same month that its first graduates commenced {{the next phase of}} their training at No.1 BFTS. Those students selected to be navigators rather than pilots went on to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. No.1 IFTS was responsible for staging aerial pageants as part of Air Force Week in September 1952, and again in September 1953. Ground staff from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency held at Liverpool, New South Wales, in December 1953. In April 1954, the Tiger Moths practised bombing and strafing troops in an exercise with the Australian Army's 9th Battalion.|$|E

5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one to <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> Kensington Palace {{before they were}} old enough to drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
