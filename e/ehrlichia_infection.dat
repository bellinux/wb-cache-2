Antibodies can protect susceptible SCID mice from fatal Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection, an observation that has been hypothesized to involve the opsonization of bacteria released from host cells. To determine whether humoral immunity plays an essential role during <b>ehrlichia</b> <b>infection</b> in immunocompetent mice, we utilized a murine model of fatal monocytotropic ehrlichiosis caused by Ixodes ovatus ehrlichia. Mice lacking either B cells or FcγRI were unable to resolve a low-dose (sublethal) I. ovatus <b>ehrlichia</b> <b>infection,</b> which suggested that humoral immunity is essential for resistance. Polyclonal sera generated in I. ovatus ehrlichia-infected mice recognized a conserved ehrlichia outer membrane protein and, when administered to infected mice, caused a significant decrease in bacterial infection. Mice experimentally depleted of complement, or deficient for complement receptors 1 and 2, were also susceptible to sublethal I. ovatus <b>ehrlichia</b> <b>infection,</b> as were mice that lacked the phox 91 subunit of NADPH oxidase. The data are consistent with a mechanism whereby bacteria released from infected cells are lysed directly by complement or undergo antibody-mediated FcγR-dependent phagocytosis and subsequent exposure to reactive oxygen intermediates.

40|$|Severe hepatic {{inflammation}} is {{a common}} cause of acute liver injury following systemic infection with Ehrlichia, obligate Gram-negative intracellular bacteria that lack lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have previously shown that type I IFN (IFN-I) and inflammasome activation are key host-pathogenic mediators that promote excessive inflammation and liver damage following fatal <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection.</b> However, the underlying signals and mechanisms that regulate protective immunity and immunopathology during <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection</b> are not well understood. To address this issue, we compared susceptibility to lethal Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE) infection between wild type (WT) and MyD 88 -deficient (MyD 88 -/-) mice. We show here that MyD 88 -/- mice exhibited decreased inflammasome activation, attenuated liver injury, and were more resistant to lethal infection than WT mice, despite suppressed protective immunity and increased bacterial burden in the liver. MyD 88 -dependent inflammasome activation was also dependent on activation of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1), inhibition of autophagic flux, and defective mitophagy in macrophages. Blocking mTORC 1 signaling in infected WT mice and primary macrophages enhanced bacterial replication and attenuated inflammasome activation, suggesting autophagy promotes bacterial replication while inhibiting inflammasome activation. Finally, our data suggest TLR 9 and IFN-I are upstream signaling mechanisms triggering MyD 88 -mediated mTORC 1 and inflammasome activation in macrophages following <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection.</b> This study reveals that Ehrlichia-induced liver injury and toxic shock are mediated by MyD 88 -dependent inflammasome activation and autophagy inhibition...|$|E

40|$|Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate, {{intracellular}} bacterium, {{transmitted by}} the tick Amblyomma americanum, {{and is the}} causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis infections. We previously demonstrated that E. chaffeensis is capable of growing in Drosophila S 2 cells. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that E. chaffeensis can infect adult Drosophila melanogaster. Adult Drosophila organisms were experimentally challenged with intra-abdominal injections of bacteria. Ehrlichia-infected flies showed decreased survival compared to wild-type flies, and bacteria isolated from flies could reinfect mammalian macrophages. <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infections</b> activated both the cellular and humoral immune responses in the fly. Hemocytes phagocytosed bacteria after injection, and antimicrobial peptide pathways were induced following infection. Increased pathogenicity in flies carrying mutations in genes in both the Toll and Imd pathways suggests that both immune defense pathways participate in host defense. Induction of Drosophila cellular and humoral responses and the in vivo replication of E. chaffeensis suggests that D. melanogaster is a suitable host for E. chaffeensis.

Seropositive sheep were not found in southeast, east or northern Norway. Thirty-two flocks were seropositive, although tick-borne fever had only been diagnosed earlier in half of these. In 78 % of the seropositive flocks, more than 80 % of the sheep were seropositive. A total of 35. 7 % and 36. 3 % of lambs and adults were found seropositive, respectively. However, the overall seroprevalence among animals that had been grazing on Ixodes pastures were 0. 80 for the lambs and 0. 84 for the adults.

40|$|Autophagy is {{an innate}} {{anti-microbial}} host defense that maintains tissue homeostasis. Autophagy is negatively {{regulated by the}} nutrient-sensing mTORC 1 complex. In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and inflammasome activation during <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection.</b> Monocytic Ehrlichia is a Gram negative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes fatal human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Ehrlichia lacks LPS, but induces inflammasome activation leading to acute liver damage. In humans, the potentially fatal human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) mimics sepsis and toxic shock-like syndrome [1, 2], making Ehrlichia a viable model system for these conditions {{in the absence of}} LPS. During virulent <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection</b> confocal data shows that autophagy increased with infection, despite clear activation of the autophagy inhibitor mTORC 1. This is likely due to a balance of mTORC 1 dependent and independent autophagy. Employing bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) from mice deficient in MyD 88 and TLR 9 we reveal a novel signaling pathway for IOE mediated autophagy regulation and inflammasome activation centered around IFNβ production. We have previously shown that the virulent Ehrlichia strain Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE) expresses higher levels of IFNβ than the avirulent strain Ehrlichia muris (EM) [3]. When IFNβ is added to BMM mTORC 1 activation increases, a phenomenon further increased when IFNβ is added to IOE infected BMM. Both IOE and IFNβ mediated mTORC 1 activation are abrogated by knockout of the TLR 9 receptor. This placed IFNβ upstream of TLR 9 in the IOE mediated mTORC 1 signaling pathway. As both TLR 9 is activated by dsDNA, we have hypothesized that these receptors are activated by mitochondrial DNA released in response to IFNβ mediated DAMP production. These data suggest that LPS-negative Ehrlichia regulates autophagy with mTORC 1, and that this mTORC 1 activation is achieved via IFNβ mediated TLR 9. Our findings reveal a novel regulation of autophagy and the inflammasome in macrophages via MyD 88 and mTORC 1 during infection with intracellular pathogens...|$|E

40|$|B cell {{activating}} {{factor of}} the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) is an essential survival factor for B cells and {{has been shown to}} regulate T cell-independent (TI) IgM production. During <b>Ehrlichia</b> muris <b>infection,</b> TI IgM secretion in the spleen was BAFF dependent, and antibody-mediated BAFF neutralization led to an impairment of IgM-mediated host defense. The failure of TI plasmablasts to secrete IgMwas not a consequence of alterations in their generation, survival, or early differentiation, since all occurred normally in infected mice following BAFF neutralization. Gene expression characteristic of plasma cell differentiation was also unaffected by BAFF neutralization in vivo, and except for CD 138, plasmablast cell surface marker expression was unaf-fected. IgMwas produced, since it was detected intracellularly, and impaired secretion was not due to a failure to express the IgM secretory exon. Addition of BAFF to plasmablasts in vitro rescued IgM secretion, suggesting that BAFF signaling can directly regulate secretory processes. Our findings indicate that BAFF signaling canmodulate TI host defense by acting at a late stage in B cell differentiation, via its regulation of terminal plasmablast differentiation and/or IgM secretion.

Twenty 5 -month-old lambs of the Dala and Rygja breeds were used. Ten lambs were inoculated intravenously with a stabilate of an ovine E. phagocytophila strain. On {{the third day of}} fever, 4 lambs were given long-acting oxytetracycline (Terramycin prolongatum vet ®, Pfizer) (20 mg/kg) intramuscularly and another 4 lambs were given short-acting oxytetracycline (Terramycin vet ®, Pfizer) (10 mg/kg) intravenously for 5 consecutive days. The lambs were examined for the presence of <b>Ehrlichia</b> <b>infection</b> by blood smear evaluation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody titre against E. equi. One month after the last antibiotic treatment, 250 ml citrate blood from each of these lambs were inoculated into each of 10 susceptible lambs, which were observed during the following 6 weeks. The results indicate that oxytetracycline given in the acute stage of the infection may effectively teminate the development of fever, rickettsemia and weight reduction in E. phagocytophila infected lambs. No difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups. However, at least 3 of 8 antibiotic treated lambs (37. 5 %) were still infected with granulocytic Ehrlichia 3 months after treatment. sheep; antibodies; Ehrlichia equi; persistence; tick-borne fever...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{determine}} the seroprevalence of <b>Ehrlichia</b> canis <b>infection,</b> {{as well as to}} identify risk factors associated to the seropositivity, a serological survey was conducted in 109 dogs assisted at the Hospital Veterinário/Centro de Saúde e Tecnologia Rural (CSTR) /Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Campus de Patos, Paraíba State, Northeastern Brazil. Serological diagnosis of ehrlichiosis was performed by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and sera presenting antibody titers >; 40 were considered positive. Of the 109 samples, 72. 5 % were positive (95 % CI = 63. 1 % - 80. 6 %). Animals that had contact with other dogs (odds ratio = 3. 59; 95 % CI = 1. 41 - 9. 12), contact with ponds (odds ratio = 8. 39; 95 % CI = 1. 01 - 69. 87) or with free access to the street (odds ratio = 6. 24; 95 % CI = 1. 28 - 30. 39) were more exposed to the risk of infection...|$|R
40|$|To {{escape from}} {{reactive}} oxygen species generated in response to infection, intracellular pathogens, such as Salmonellae and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, can modulate the expression and distribution of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase components. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of <b>Ehrlichia</b> chaffeensis <b>infection</b> {{on the ability of}} human monocytic THP- 1 cells to produce superoxide anion. Phorbol ester-stimulated superoxide generation and mRNAs for gp 91 phox, p 47 phox, and p 67 phox were significantly increased in E. chaffeensis-infected THP- 1 cells. These increases were also achieved in THP- 1 cells cultured in medium conditioned by the E. chaffeensis-infected cells, indicating that bystander cells can be activated for superoxide generation and implicating soluble factors in the response. Heat-stable and -unstable factors represented one-third and two-thirds of this activity, respectively. These results suggest that immature human monocytic cells increase their ability to generate superoxide anion in response to E. chaffeensis infection regardless they have been directly invaded or not...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The lymphoreticular {{response}} of dogs to <b>Ehrlichia</b> canis <b>infection</b> was studied after immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide or antilymphocyte serum. Immu-nosuppression {{did not increase}} mortality, nor did it prevent or significantly modify the clinical manifestations of acute ehrlichiosis. The clinical, hematologic and serum biochemical char-acteristics of acute ehrlichiosis appeared seven or more days later in immunosuppressed than in immunologically intact infected dogs. Immunosuppressive therapy generally attenuated the lesions of acute ehrlichiosis. Lympho-reticular tissues were partially depleted of lymphocytes, {{as would be expected}} following cyclophosphamide therapy, but the hemopoietic tissue of cyclophosphamide-treated principals was much more cellular than that of the controls, perhaps demonstrating a direct stirnulatory effect of E. canis infection on bone marrow. Antilymphocyte serum therapy reduced cellularity of the thymic-dependent areas in both the spleen and lymph nodes, but B-cell areas were not affected. The B-cell areas did not increase in activity during infection in the antilymphocyte serum-treated dogs, suggesting the need for an intact T-cell compartment for the lymphocytic proliferation that occurs in nonsuppressed infected dogs. Renal vasculitis and lympho-plas...|$|R
