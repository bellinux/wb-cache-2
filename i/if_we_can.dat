5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

25|$|Integral linear {{programs}} are of central {{importance in the}} polyhedral aspect of combinatorial optimization since they provide an alternate characterization of a problem. Specifically, for any problem, the convex hull of the solutions is an integral polyhedron; if this polyhedron has a nice/compact description, then we can efficiently find the optimal feasible solution under any linear objective. Conversely, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> prove that a linear programming relaxation is integral, then it is the desired description of the convex hull of feasible (integral) solutions.|$|E

In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical {{computer}} science seeks to understand which computational {{problems can be}} solved by using a computer (computability theory) and how efficiently (computational complexity theory).

Such an algorithm can be implemented as a computer program that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from input, performs some computation, and produces the solution as output. Formalisms such as random access machines or universal Turing machines can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.|$|E
