Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E

25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou {{thought a}} lot about the human crave for meaning, and about the absurdity of the human condition, rooted in matter but yearning for spirit. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning in and of itself. At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E

25|$|During {{the same}} years, Daniel Bernoulli {{published}} his book Hydrodynamics (1738), {{in which he}} derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with {{the walls of a}} container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume. Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion {{as a result of his}} experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of the vis viva principle.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, Unomásuno fired 70 employees, {{including}} {{four of its}} founders: Christa Cowrie, Jorge Reyes Estrada, Fernando Belmont Acero, and Patricia Cardona. Most of them accepted the 33% severance plan the newspaper offered; Editorial Uno {{did not have the}} financial support to pay them what was required by law. The founders and eleven more employees, however, sued Unomásuno and asked for the company to fully pay for their severance plan. The employees wrote a petition stating that they were fired because PRI politician Francisco Labastida Ochoa was not winning the 2000 presidential race. They said that the owners poured {{a lot of money in}} his campaign, including money that was to be used to pay its employees. Alonso Muñoz told the press that Unomásuno was going through financial difficulties and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of selling the newspaper. The newspaper had MXN$85 million in debt and MXN$20 million in assets (totaling a negative net worth of MXN$65 million). Alonso Muñoz said he was considering partnering with Alonso Coratella's Mundo Ejecutivo media group and starting a new era for Unomásuno.|$|E
25|$|George Beurling {{was born}} in 1921 in Verdun (now part of Montreal), Quebec into a {{religious}} family and was the third of five children in the family. His father, Frederick Gustav Beurling, was a Swedish and a commercial artist working for the Claude Neon Company. His mother, Hetty Florence Gibbs, is of English descent and {{was born in}} the Montreal suburb of Pointe-Saint-Charles. George Beurling began to develop an interest in flying at the age of 6 when his father built him a model aircraft. His parents wanted him to study in McGill University and become successful commercial artist just like his father. At the age of 15, he quit school and took up a job to increase his income. One year later, he had 150 flying hours and managed to pass all examinations for a commercial pilot license. Wanting to increase his flying experience, he went to China, hoping to join the Chinese Nationalist Air Force by crossing the US border. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> to head to San Francisco and work for somewhile in China and later sign up for the job. Eventually, he was arrested as an immigrant at the border and was repatriated back home. He first took the controls of an aircraft in 1933 and was flying solo by 1938. He left school to work for an air freight company in Gravenhurst, Ontario, and soon gained a commercial license. Beurling joined the Royal Air Force in September 1940.|$|E

25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E

[...] He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as [...] "1859".|$|E

Just before the season started, Wiggins was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a utility role, feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting position. He believed {{that he could be}} an asset in the leadoff batting slot.|$|E

Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer.

Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of cutting me back to one column a week.
