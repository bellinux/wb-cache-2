He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its materialism, {{and at the same time}} wishes he could connect better with the people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick as the end of the month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. <b>He</b> <b>settles</b> on a brothel run by a Russian mob.

It was their first film with cinematographer Roger Deakins, a key collaborator for the next 25 years.|$|E

25|$|Bachelor Sanson Carrasco is seen {{covering}} a bookcase with wallpaper, while Antonina is putting some rusty old armour and a helmet made of pasteboard into a cupboard. Don Quixote de la Mancha enters, reading a book. He {{goes to the}} bookcase and, not finding it, believes it has been stolen by evil magicians. Then <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> into an armchair and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, {{but most of all}} Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be so lovely and noble that she must be divinity. Gradually he nods and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.|$|E
25|$|Professor Fr. Arsenius John Baptist Vuibert (S.S.), a 19th-century historian, {{observed}} that Biblical Chronologies are uncertain due to discrepancies in {{the figures in}} Genesis and other methodological factors, accounting for hundreds of different chronologies being assigned by historians. In {{the case of the}} Fathers of the Sixth Ecumenical Council, who assigned 5509 BC. as the date of the creation of man, he writes that it was in response to the emperor's wishes to fix an era or convenient starting point for historical computation. Therefore, it was a decision of mere historical convenience, not respecting either faith or morals, which are what is truly of intrinsic value in the Scriptures. Having made this disclaimer, <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> on the Benedictine Chronology of 4963 BC for the purposes of his history.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in Mostly Harmless (published in 1992), Vogons {{take over}} The Hitchhiker's Guide (under {{the name of}} InfiniDim Enterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After {{abruptly}} losing Fenchurch and travelling around the galaxy despondently, Arthur's spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella, where <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of simple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into The Guide's offices, gets himself an infinite expense account from the computer system, and then meets The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II, an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast power and a hidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine's aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for safety ("Oh yes, whose?"—Arthur).|$|E

25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw {{to learn to be}} a young lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and {{is in the middle of}} the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.|$|E
25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E
500|$|Guybrush also {{encounters}} {{the governor}} and is instantly smitten, and she soon reciprocates. However, as he completes the tasks set for him, the island is raided by LeChuck and his undead crew, who abduct Elaine and then retreat to their secret hideout on Monkey IslandTM. Guybrush takes {{it upon himself to}} rescue her, buying a ship and hiring Carla, Otis, and Meathook as crew before setting sail for the fabled island. When Guybrush reaches Monkey Island, he discovers a village of cannibals in a dispute with Herman Toothrot, a ragged castaway marooned there. <b>He</b> <b>settles</b> their quarrel, and then recovers a magical [...] "voodoo root" [...] from LeChuck's ship for the cannibals, who provide him with a seltzer bottle of [...] "voodoo root elixir" [...] that can destroy ghosts.|$|E

500|$|Connor, {{despite being}} {{the son of}} two [...] "vampires," [...] {{is meant to be}} [...] "human" [...] with {{otherwise}} super powers. Due to this, he wasn’t given the vampire makeup of the series. Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this, considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that the lack of it saved him much time. Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin, and his attire was said to resemble 'Peter Pan' and 'Robin Hood'. He was also wearing, as a trophy, a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell. After <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> in this world, he drops the necklace and is given a more casual set of clothes: jeans, T-shirts, and jackets. The concept behind Connor’s wardrobe was that, unconcerned with this world’s fashion sense, he [...] "just took whatever was available." [...] Yet, one interviewer notices his clothing to be [...] "conservative [...] for somebody who's never seen an advert". Connor's hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife. Afterward he's given a modern and cleaner look with longer, styled hair. Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style calling it 'David Cassidy hair-do' and feeling it was a 'little bit heavy'.|$|E
500|$|Adam Williams is {{a serial}} womaniser who lives a {{carefree}} lifestyle until <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> down with Rachel—though {{he is still}} tempted by the next-door neighbour and women in fast cars. Bullen based Adam's womanising personality on how he saw himself during his twenties. He is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer during the second series, a storyline developed by Bullen to directly contrast Adam's Lothario characterisation. Adam marries Rachel in Series 3 and their son, Matthew, is born in Series 4. In Series 5, Adam's estranged father Bill Williams arrives in Manchester. Adam moves to patch up the relationship after Bill comes out as a bisexual. After Rachel's death, Adam and Matthew leave their old house to see Bill. Adam's backstory was inconsistent; the first series established that Adam and Pete {{had known each other}} since their childhood when they attended the same school in Manchester. To justify Adam's accent, his Northern Irish origins were developed in Series 3 and it was explained on screen that he spent his school holidays there. His background is reinforced when his father is introduced in Series 5. Bullen admitted that Adam's biography was never fully planned but conceded that Cold Feet was [...] "full of gaffes".|$|E
500|$|Olivero soon {{tires of}} the first ledge, and leaving Siloēn behind {{he moves to the}} second, where he learns to cut and polish crystals, the most sacred of objects in this {{subterranean}} world. Eventually he is allowed to move to the highest ledge of all, [...] "the final stage of life". There he is taught the [...] "basic principles of the universe", that there is only Order and Disorder. [...] "Order... the space-filling Mass about them... Disorder is empty space". Disorder is caused by the senses, which, [...] "being confined to the body... create the illusion of self-hood". Olivero selects a grotto in which to spend what remains of his life alone, contemplating the [...] "natural and absolute beauty" [...] of the crystals he accepts from the crystal-cutters. Food and water is brought regularly, and <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> to the task of preparing his body for [...] "the perfection of death", which when it comes he meets with a [...] "peculiar joy". Removing Olivero's body from the grotto the attendants encounter another group carrying Siloēn, who died {{at the same time as}} Olivero. The pair are laid together in a petrifying trough, to [...] "become part of the same crystal harmony", as is customary when any of the Green people die.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, {{he became}} a nationally {{sponsored}} artist (komponistgasje) and had started receiving state income for artists. After World War II broke out in 1940, moved to Nordfjord where he lived until 1947, when <b>he</b> <b>settled</b> in Gausdal in Oppland and lived there until 1966, <b>he</b> <b>settled</b> in Lillehammer.|$|R

500|$|Wilde hesitated about {{submitting}} {{the script}} to Alexander, worrying {{that it might}} be unsuitable for the StJames's Theatre, whose typical repertoire was relatively serious, and explaining that it had been written in response to a request for a play [...] "with no real serious interest". When Henry James's Guy Domville failed, Alexander turned to Wilde and agreed to put on his play. Alexander began his usual meticulous preparations, interrogating the author on each line and planning stage movements with a toy theatre. In the course of these rehearsals, Alexander asked Wilde to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts. The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr. Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to arrest the profligate [...] "Ernest" [...] (i.e.,Jack) for his unpaid dining bills. Algernon, who is posing as [...] "Ernest", will be led away to Holloway Jail unless <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> his accounts immediately. Jack finally agrees to pay for Ernest, everyone thinking that it is Algernon's bill when in fact it is his own. The four-act version was first played on the radio in a BBC production and is still sometimes performed. Peter Raby argues that the three-act structure is more effective, and that the shorter original text is more theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Peter Neal {{was making a}} short film {{documentary}} about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking). [...] On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". [...] The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced. [...] For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand. [...] Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar. [...] After a false start, <b>he</b> <b>settles</b> into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "100 percent country blues... s with great feeling, however artificial {{the circumstances of the}} session may have been". [...] Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James. [...] Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as [...] "Big Fat Mama" [...] and [...] "Big Road Blues". [...] The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C–F–B–E–G–C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style. [...] At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with [...] "Did you think I could do that?" [...] In addition to the 1968 documentary, the [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] performance is included in the 1973 film Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack album (re-released on Blues). [...] In the UK, it was released by Reprise Records as a single in 1973 with the Experience's adaptation of B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby" [...] recorded at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 as the B-side.|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, Gun Runner {{returned}} in the $1 million Louisiana Derby, {{also at the}} Fair Grounds, {{where he was the}} third betting choice at odds of almost 4-1. He was close behind a slow early pace, then drew away in the stretch to win by [...] lengths in a dominant performance. [...] "The good thing is he's very easy to manage," [...] said Geroux. [...] "He has so many gears. <b>He</b> <b>settles</b> really nicely, and when you ask him to go, he has a nice turn of foot." ...|$|E
