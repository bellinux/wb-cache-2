The anthraquinone-based Reactive Blue 19 dye, {{which is more}} resistant to biodegradation owing to its fused aromatic structure compared to azo based one, is utilized as a model compound in this research to demonstrate the photodegradation effect of TiO 2 on reactive dyes. It is shown that a layer of TiO 2 nanoparticles is homogeneously coated on fiber surfaces and their particle sizes are smaller than those remaining in the residual <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquors.</b> The crystallinity and optical property of the resultant PA fabrics are changed due to this hydrothermal-dyeing process. In comparison with the solely dyed PA fabrics, the PA fabrics dyed and simultaneously modified with anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibit better color fastnesses against artificial light (Xenon) while maintain similar grades of color fastnesses against washing with soap, wet scrubbing, dry cleaning as well as dry/wet rubbing. While changes in the tensile strength, elongation and water absorbency of the resultant PA fabrics were not found, the addition of tetrabutyl titanate in the <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquor</b> is proved to facilitate the reaction of reactive dye with PA fabric and the resultant PA fabric shade.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{stability}} (in terms of half-life time) and decolourisation efficiency of free and immobilised laccase was determined in four industrial dyeing effluents. The <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquors</b> composition and the chemical {{structure of the}} dyes influence significantly the stability and the decolourisation ability of the enzyme. The dyeing in enzymatically decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent provided consistency of the colour with both bright and dark dyes. Additionally the number of washing cycles necessary to remove the hydrolyzed dyestuff from dyed textiles was reduced using an enzymatic pre-treatment. In decolourisation experiments with immobilised laccase, two phenomenons were observed - initial decolourisation due to adsorption on the support and dye degradation due to the enzyme action. This research focuses on the stability and decolourisation ability of free and immobilised laccase in industrial dyeing effluents and their reuse for dyeing. In our experiments {{the stability of the}} immobilised laccase in <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquors</b> was unexpectedly lower than the stability of the free enzyme. The stability of the laccase in dyeing effluents {{is a result of the}} additive effect of all components presented. The decrease of enzymatic activity could be associated with the potential protein – dyeing effluent components interactions. Azoaromatic sulfonate dye anions could provide enzyme stabilisation. However, the structure of the immobilised laccase possibly became less accessible than the free enzyme for interaction with the anionic dyes, and thereby the stabilisation was not efficient. Non-ionic surfactants present in the <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquors</b> are able to stabilise the enzyme in solution by formation of a surrounding shell. The surfactant stabilisation was effective only on free enzyme. The salts in the dyebaths also displayed enzyme stabilising properties. The presence of CrVI and CrIII in the mordant dyeing effluent could cause significant loss of activity. The colour removal with immobilized laccase is due to the additive effects of dye-support adsorption, dye-protein adsorption and enzymatic dye degradation. In the decolourisation experiments carried out in pure dyes, the higher the hydrophilicity of the dye, the lower was the decolourisation. The Reactive Blue 158 adsorbed on the alumina support could act as mediator in laccase-assisted reactions, explaining the higher decolourisation of Reactive Black 5 with immobilized enzyme. The decolourisation efficiency in dyeing effluents was affected by the stabilization/destabilisation interactions in the dyeing formulation. Acceptable colour difference was achieved in dyeing with dyebaths prepared with laccase decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent. Enzymatic treatment of dyed textiles provided water savings, reducing the number of the after-dyeing washing cycles. E...|$|R

The chemical structure of the used colouring matter is observed to have all the characteristics of a typical disperse dye.

40|$|Abstract: Direct or {{substantive}} dyes {{are widely}} used in the dyeing process of cellulosic fibres because of their easy handling. In contrast to natural dyes which must be mordanted {{in order to be}} applied on the same kind of substrates, direct dyes can be used directly. These dyes contain solubilizing sulfonic acid groups that are ionized in aqueous solution, and therefore the dye molecule is present in the dyebath as the anion. As result, an electrolyte must be added to the <b>dye</b> <b>liquor</b> because cellulose fibers have a negative surface charge in water, which would repel the dye anion. The cations of the electrolyte neutralize the negative charge and favor the adsorbtion of the dye ions on the fiber. The dye sorption can be described with the help of Nernst, Freundlich or Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The aim of the present work was to establish the influence of two important parameters (temperature and electrolyte concentration) on the dyeing of a cellulosic substrate- mercerized cotton- with one disazo direct dyes, through the study of the equilibrium isotherms. The dyeings were carried out at three different temperatures: 60 o, 86 o and 96 oC and at two sodium chloride concentrations: 4 g/L and 10 g/L. The study of the dyeing process was performed by comparing the experimental isotherms of the studied dyes with the classical sorption isotherms: Nernst, Freundlich and Langmuir.

It has used 30  kHz frequency level, effective power of 120 and 350  W heating power in ultrasonic machine. In this work, wool dyeing was carried out on single jersey knitted fabric using an acid dye with and without ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 70, and 80  °C. Dye exhaustion was measured using UV/visible absorbance of the dye bath {{before and during the}} dyeing cycle. For the measurement of nodal/anti-nodal point of energy, at 60, 70, and 80  °C dyeing was done in open bath of ultrasonic machine with and without sonication at high liquor ratio. To compare the dye uptake (%) at high/conventional process, sample was dyed at 95  °C. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the diameter and surface changes of the fiber, respectively.

40|$|A {{large number}} of papers of the {{literature}} quote dyeing intensification based on the application of ultrasound (US) in the <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquor.</b> Mass transfer mechanisms are described and quantified, nevertheless these experimental results in general refer to small laboratory apparatuses with a capacity {{of a few hundred}} millilitres and extremely high volumetric energy intensity. With the strategy of overcoming the scale-up inaccuracy consequent to the technological application of ultrasounds, a dyeing pilot-plant prototype of suitable liquor capacity (about 40 L) and properly simulating several liquor to textile hydraulic relationships was designed by including US transducers with different geometries. Optimal dyeing may be obtained by optimizing the distance between transducer and textile material, the liquid height being a non-negligible operating parameter. Hence, mapping the cavitation energy in the machinery is expected to provide basic data on the intensity and distribution of the ultrasonic field in the aqueous liquor. A flat ultrasonic transducer (absorbed electrical power of 600 W), equipped with eight devices emitting at 25 kHz, was mounted horizontally at the equipment bottom. Considering industrial scale <b>dyeing,</b> <b>liquor</b> and textile substrate are reciprocally displaced to achieve a uniform coloration. In this technology a non uniform US field could affect the dyeing evenness to a large extent; hence, mapping the cavitation energy distribution in the machinery is expected to provide fundamental data and define optimal operating conditions. Local values of the cavitation intensity were recorded by using a carefully calibrated Ultrasonic Energy Meter, which is able to measure the power per unit surface generated by the cavitation implosion of bubbles. More than 200 measurements were recorded to define the map at each horizontal plane positioned at a different distance from the US transducer; tap water was heated at the same temperature used for dyeing tests (60 °C). Different liquid flow rates were tested to investigate the effect of the hydrodynamics characterizing the equipment. The mapping of the cavitation intensity in the pilot-plant machinery was performed to achieve with the following goals: a) to evaluate the influence of turbulence on the cavitation intensity, and b) to determine the optimal distance from the ultrasound device at which a fabric should be positioned, this parameter being a compromise between the cavitation intensity (higher next to the transducer) and the US field uniformity (achieved at some distance from this device).

(III) In case the adsorption being below the saturation value in the presence of a large 	amount of salt， the amount of dye on the fibre was greater than the value calculated by the 	Gilbert-Rideal equation.

The present doctoral research accepts the challenge to the UK's archaic fabric printing technology by suggesting an alternative route of dye uptake and surface design. The study is guided by the following research problem: How might lasers/intense pulsed light radiation be used to increase the uptake of dye at the surface of a fabric weave, while minimising the potential degradation in a particular fibre? The problem is resolved through five main questions and two distinct methodologies. The section comprising Questions 1 to 4 successfully investigates (a) pyrolysis in natural and man-made fibres in the course of laser-marking, (b) surface heating of a fabric weave without impairing fabric strength, (c) computer-aided transfer of artwork to the laser-marking program: specifically, how tonal images may be encoded in a limited palette of grey tones; and (d) the laser-marking process, generating interaction between dye and fibre through selective absorption of a single wavelength of radiation. An experimental scientific method is employed to calibrate all findings. The fifth research question examines how these scientifically monitored findings might be applied in commercial garment production. Collaboration was set up between `haute couture' designers and a laser machinery manufacturer, in which the author's intermediary role put to the test her theoretical and practical experience of design and lasers. The process of collaboration were closely monitored, and raw data in the form of organisational meeting talk, annotated drawings, laser-marked fabric samples, have been analysed using the `Framework' method. Based on this research, future investigations will aim to (a) explore the selective absorption of a single wavelength of radiation by dye, fibre and <b>dye</b> <b>liquor,</b> (b) investigate the tonal marking of a 4 -colour design on dyed impregnated fabrics, and (c) explore niche market strategy in a wide spectrum of collaboration between industry and `haute couture'...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{under the}} consumed of {{water quality and}} the quantity of generated waste water {{is second only to}} water-intensive production areas such as ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemical and pulp - paper industry. These industries technological water is used for three main purposes: cooling equipment, technological solutions to prepare and wash. Painted in one kilogram of tissue consumption of 30 – 60 liters of water. This represents about 16 % of the total water consumed in production. Such production volumes generated by large quantities of liquid wastewater. Wastewater contaminated with synthetic organic pollutants and their proper treatment {{is one of the biggest}} environmental problems. Their treatment can be used in a variety of methods: biological treatment, chemical treatment, membrane filtration, adsorption, ozonation, Fenton's reagent, photo-catalytic, oxidative processes, electrocoagulation, and ion exchange. This study used the most effective treatment methods - adsorption, ozonation, and both of these methods together. This study used artificially manufactured synthetic wastewater - methylene blue, Astrazon Red and Realan Golden Yellow solution. Methylene blue was chosen due to its wide use, light transparency and the degradation can be identified by fading. Astrazon Red and Realan Golden Yellow paint was chosen so that the creation of the most complex water treatment scenario. These paints are the most difficult to be broken down. Sorption process selected the most effective absorbent – Norit Nrs Carbon GA 0. 5 – 2. 5 activated carbon and determined the most effective of its points (2 g). Using ozone method Astrazon Red and Golden Real Yellow dye concentration decreased about 20 %, and methylene blue treatment efficiency was as high as about 80 %. Color of the <b>dye</b> <b>liquor</b> over the entire experimental period (one hour) was removed. Total organic carbon (TOC) content of this method has been removed up to 16 %. The most efficient results were obtained applying ozone – sorbent system. Probably removed methylene blue dye (80 %). The full paint was cleaned after 15 minutes. On average, clean up - Astrazon Red paint, after 5 minutes of system operation concentrations decreased by about 50 %, the longest eliminated Real Golden Yellow paint, after 5 min concentrations decreased only about 30 %. This system is effective not only in color removal but also TOC removal. TOC reduced by about 50 %, depending on the type of paint. To evaluate the effectiveness of activated carbon and the ability to innovate has undergone regeneration. This showed that the selected activated carbon it is appropriate to reuse. After using it to four times its efficiency decreased by only about 1 %. The following work was proposed optimal parameters and effective methods of technological recommendations, paint, textile industry wastewater disposal...|$|E
40|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of biochemical reactions, the investigation of microflow behavior, and the confirmation of simulation results in microfluidics, experimentally quantitative measurements are indispensable. To characterize the mixing and reaction of fluids in microchannel devices, we propose a mixing quality index (Mqi) to quantify the cross-sectional patterns (also called mixing patterns) of fluids, captured with a confocal-fluorescence microscope (CFM). The operating parameters of the CFM for quantification were carefully tested. We analyzed mixing patterns, flow advection, and mass exchange of fluids in the devices with overlapping channels of two kinds. The mixing length of the two devices derived from the analysis of Mqi is demonstrated {{to be more precise}} than that estimated with a commonly applied method of blending <b>dye</b> <b>liquors.</b> By means of fluorescence resonance-energy transfer (FRET), we monitored the hybridization of two complementary oligonucleotides (a FRET pair) in the devices. The captured patterns reveal that hybridization is a progressive process along the downstream channel. The FRET reaction and the hybridization period were characterized through quantification of the reaction patterns. This analytical approach is a promising diagnostic tool that is applicable to the real-time analysis of biochemical and chemical reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), catalytic, or synthetic processes in microfluidic devices...|$|R
40|$|The hydrodynamics of a {{dyeing machine}} affects the {{exchange}} mechanisms between a textile {{material and the}} liquid medium to a large extent. Namely, the transfer of dyes and chemicals from the <b>dyeing</b> <b>liquor</b> {{and the release of}} non-bonded substances during subsequent rinsing steps can be altered by relative movement between phases. Such aspects have not been investigated thoroughly, although the typical approach of chemical engineering can offer a relevant contribution in this view. As a practical result, important benefits may follow in various operations of the dyeing process, aimed at optimising the equipment use or saving resources, in particular water. The attention of this study was focused on hank-dyeing machinery, since this production demands a considerable amount of water due to the large liquor ratios. The experimental study was carried out at a textile industry facility by operating on two units of equipment at significantly different scales. The rinsing operation was monitored by sampling the liquid at several positions along the vertical direction of the liquor: colour, conductivity and other chemical properties were measured in order to devise an optimal production policy aimed at saving water. A mathematical model of the equipment, based on a simple hydrodynamic hypothesis and proper mass balances, was proposed, and its outputs were compared with the experimental results. Both practical considerations and the theoretical analysis suggest that water requirement during rinsing can be halved by modifying the procedure without affecting the final quality of product...|$|R
