5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art {{was reflected in the}} story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E
5|$|His career ended abruptly. During {{his brief}} tenure as {{co-owner}} of the Red Sox, McAleer quarreled with longtime <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Ban Johnson, president of the American League. In the wake of this disagreement, he sold off his shares in the Red Sox and broke off his relationship with Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|After the band's acrimonious {{split with}} their second manager, Allen Klein, in 1971, Jagger {{took control of}} their {{business}} affairs after speaking with an up-and-coming frontman, J. B.

Mick Taylor, Jones' replacement, left the band in December 1974 {{and was replaced by}} Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood in 1975, who also operated as a mediator within the group, and between Jagger and Richards in particular.|$|E
30|$|To {{conclude}} this section, informed guessing by <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> was {{not highly}} successful and participants could not authenticate. However, {{questions in the}} public, <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> domain were vulnerable to guessing. The abuse case scenario is discussed below to examine challenge questions in the individual themes.|$|R

5|$|Alex North's unused {{music had}} its first public {{appearance}} in Telarc's {{issue of the}} main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. All the music North originally wrote was recorded commercially by North's <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Jerry Goldsmith with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and was released on Varèse Sarabande CDs shortly after Telarc's first theme release but before North's death. Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which had survived in the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{decision}} {{to name a}} character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague,</b> the former opera singer Edgar P. Jacobs, in the story, adding a figure named Jacobini to the billing on the opera performance alongside Castafiore. He also inserted a cameo {{of himself as a}} reporter into the final scene of the story.|$|E
5|$|Pickett was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 8th Infantry Regiment. He soon gained national recognition in the Mexican–American War when he carried the American colors over the parapet during the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847. Wounded {{at the base of}} the wall, Pickett's <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Lieutenant James Longstreet handed him the colors. Pickett carried the flag over the wall and fought his way to the roof of the palace, unfurling it over the fortress and announcing its surrender. He received a brevet promotion to captain following this action.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the project}} was in {{development}} and discussions were taking place as early as September 2012, the recording did not start until the Spring of 2013, being delayed by Gaga's hip surgery and cancellation of her Born This Way Ball tour. The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> of Gaga, played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet. Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn were also enlisted as musicians.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

30|$|Summary of Security Abuse Case: In summary, {{personal}} and academic questions {{are likely to be}} known to <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleagues.</b> The challenge questions in the personal theme received one matched answer using an informed guessing attack. The questions in the personal theme were reported with positive efficiency, however, answer to personal questions can be guessed by <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> using the equality algorithm. Questions in the contact and academic themes can also be prone to guessing attacks by <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family with one question each being successfully guessed by <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Although, the use of a relaxed algorithm may enhance the usability of challenge questions, however, it can also increase the security risks.|$|R

5|$|Hillcourt was tasked {{to write}} a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> E. Urner Goodman, the {{national}} program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, to be near Schiff Scout Reservation, the BSA's national training center, {{so he could be}} in place to put this theories to a practical test. In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16years.|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested on her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 (later {{known as}} Europe Day) {{occurred}} after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy. France was thus the first government {{to agree to}} surrender sovereignty in a supranational Community. That decision {{was based on a}} text, written and edited by Schuman's <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague,</b> the Foreign Ministry lawyer, professor Paul Reuter with the assistance of economist Jean Monnet and Schuman's Directeur de Cabinet, Bernard Clappier. It laid out a plan for a European Community to pool the coal and steel of its members in a common market.|$|E

5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague,</b> Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E
5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E

5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's closest <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> and {{pastor of}} St. Peterskirche, {{publicly}} {{called for the}} removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and iconoclastic activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the mass and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, St. Laurent {{considered}} recommending {{the appointment}} of Howe as governor general. The governor general {{had always been a}} British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed with them. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953, by which time Howe would be 68. St. Laurent saw this as a way of allowing his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> to step away from politics for a quieter life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister. He was also reluctant to exchange real power for the nominal power of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended {{the appointment of}} Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, after {{originally}} {{being placed}} as a radio operator, {{he was moved}} to research duties regarding sound ranging due to his specialist knowledge. In 1921, Born returned to Göttingen, arranging another chair for his long-time <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> James Franck. Under Born, Göttingen {{became one of the}} world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925, Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.|$|E
