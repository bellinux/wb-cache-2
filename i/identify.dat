5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and <b>identify</b> particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to <b>identify</b> organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to <b>identify</b> organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
