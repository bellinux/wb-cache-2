40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between employment duration, unemployment duration and general skill accumulation in a search equilibrium. I show how the level of general skills and the duration of employment are positively correlated, and both variables are negatively correlated with the duration of unemployment spells. With search frictions, general skill accumulation {{is associated with a}} hold up problem since it benefits future job vacancies which workers expect to be matched with. However, if vacancies direct their search to workers of different skill levels, workers indirectly internalise this externality. I show how Becker’s <b>general</b> skill <b>finance</b> <b>rule</b> is modified for a search economy. Extensions analyse the decision of whether to accumulate skills through training or education...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{explanation}} for why centralisation of political decision making results in overspending in some policy domains, whereas too low spending persists in others. We study a model in which delegates from jurisdictions bargain over local public goods provision. If all {{of the costs of}} public goods are shared through a common budget, policy makers delegate bargaining to `public good lovers', resulting in overprovision of public goods. If a sufficiently large part of the costs can no be shared, underprovision persists because policy makers delegate bargaining to `conservatives'. We derive <b>financing</b> <b>rules</b> that eliminate the incentives for strategic delegation. Centralised decision making, strategic delegation, <b>financing</b> <b>rules.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|The Electoral Commission of New Zealand (ECNZ), {{the body}} that organises elections, is also in charge of {{collecting}} and monitoring financial reports by parties and candidates. However, its mandate to investigate, enforce and sanction political <b>finance</b> <b>rules</b> is not very strong. The ECNZ does not carry out investigations and it would only report if the case went to court (after being investigated by the police). Following the 2005 election the ECNZ reported 17 potential offences (some of them relating to campaign <b>finance</b> <b>rules)</b> to the police, which did not prosecute any of the cases. [...] Because the rules (as detailed above) are ridden with loopholes, their enforcement does not significantly influence the real flow of funds into party coffers and out of them. In 2005, both major parties exceeded the statutory spending limits without being sanctioned.|$|R
