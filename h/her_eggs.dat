5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide <b>her</b> <b>eggs,</b> but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Clifford E. Trafzer's A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe retells {{the story}} of Sinawavi (Coyote)'s love for Poowavi (Louse). <b>Her</b> <b>eggs</b> are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.|$|E

She ceases the attacks when <b>her</b> <b>egg</b> hatches.|$|R
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} {{protecting}} her while she moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b> Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E

Minutes before the queen lays <b>her</b> <b>egg,</b> the workers will regurgitate their food into the cell. The queen will lay <b>her</b> <b>egg</b> {{on top of this}} food and then the cell will be closed rapidly by the workers.

Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen and asks her what she is doing and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives.|$|E
5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling {{to the surface of}} the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E

5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of <b>her</b> <b>eggs,</b> such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
50|$|In the bee {{species of}} Euglossa cordata, {{dominant}} reproductive females will display brood parasitism by replacing <b>her</b> daughterâ€™s <b>eggs</b> with <b>her</b> own <b>eggs,</b> diverting <b>her</b> resources from producing grand-offspring to producing {{more of her}} own offspring. In addition, to increase her longevity and fecundity, a mother will also eat <b>her</b> daughterâ€™s <b>eggs</b> to gain more nutrients.|$|R

5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, {{such as the}} solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> in individual cells and provides each egg {{with a number of}} live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Defending a {{breeding}} territory is fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or a particular substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b> There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E
50|$|Are You My Mother? is {{the story}} about a {{hatchling}} bird.

He does not understand where his mother is so he goes to look for her.

5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay <b>her</b> <b>eggs</b> which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin is {{territorial}} {{during the}} breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2ha (0.6â€“3acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males {{have been seen}} to face one another 30cm to 1m (12â€“40in) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b> Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been 36km (22mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower State Forest in northern Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays <b>her</b> <b>eggs.</b> During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2â€“2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22Â°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E
