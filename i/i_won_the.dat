5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance {{that there would be no}} more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How <b>I</b> <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E

25|$|In {{this part}} of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji <b>I</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E

500|$|As Lennon {{was either}} touring or recording, {{supposed}} family holidays in 1966 were skiing in St. Moritz, with producer George Martin and his girlfriend, or {{staying at a}} castle in Ireland, with George Harrison and Pattie Boyd (Harrison's wife).

500|$|The anti-war, black comedy How <b>I</b> <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> War, {{featuring}} Lennon's only {{appearance in}} a non–Beatles full-length film, {{was shown in}} cinemas in October 1967. McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its soundtrack release, featuring Lennon's acclaimed, Lewis Carroll-inspired [...] "I Am the Walrus", was a success. With Epstein gone, the band members became increasingly involved in business activities, and in February 1968 they formed Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture {{as an attempt to}} achieve, [...] "artistic freedom within a business structure", but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with Yoko Ono, and McCartney's own marriage plans, left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon approached Allen Klein, who had managed The Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion. Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{began writing}} {{the song in}} Almería, Spain, during the filming of Richard Lester's How <b>I</b> <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> War in September–October 1966. The {{earliest}} demo of the song, recorded in Almería, had no refrain and only one verse: [...] "There's no one on my wavelength / I mean, it's either too high or too low / That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right / I mean it's not too bad". He revised the words to this verse {{to make them more}} obscure, then wrote the melody and part of the lyrics to the refrain (which functioned as a bridge and did not yet include a reference to Strawberry Fields). He subsequently added another verse and the mention of Strawberry Fields. The first verse on the released version was the last to be written, close to the time of the song's recording. For the refrain, Lennon was again inspired by his childhood memories: the words [...] "nothing to get hung about" [...] were inspired by Aunt Mimi's strict order not to play in the grounds of Strawberry Field, to which Lennon replied, [...] "They can't hang you for it." [...] The first verse Lennon wrote became the second one in the released version of the song, and the second verse he wrote became the last.|$|E

500|$|In 1960 Hordern played Admiral Sir John Tovey in the British war film Sink the Bismarck!, {{based on}} the book Last Nine Days of the Bismarck by C. S. Forester and with a plot {{reminiscent}} of his naval days. With a few smaller roles in between, Hordern started work on the American epic historical drama film Cleopatra. It was made in 1962 and according to the actor, was [...] "the most extraordinary piece of film-making in which I had the pleasure to take part". He played the Roman orator Cicero and was hired on an eight-week contract which due to various setbacks, including cast sickness and adverse weather conditions, was extended to nine months. Much to Hordern's annoyance, the film would require him to once again work with Rex Harrison, who was cast as Caesar. Despite the animosity between them, they agreed to endure each other's company {{for the sake of the}} film. [...] The agreement was short-lived; Harrison made a drunken quip at a cast dinner about Nina which prompted Hordern to assault him. [...] The incident almost resulted in Hordern's dismissal, but the matter was quickly resolved by producers and the two were kept separate in between filming. In 1993 Hordern claimed the incident had [...] "cleared the air" [...] between them and they eventually became friends. After Cleopatras release, Hordern made a return to films, appearing in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), How <b>I</b> <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> War (1967), and Where Eagles Dare in 1968. He also featured in the Roman farce A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum in 1966.|$|E
