5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts.

5|$|British General Edmund Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), had won {{a decisive}} victory against the German General Erich von Falkenhayn, {{commander}} of Ottoman forces in Palestine, at the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 November. The British Empire victory forced von Falkenhayn to withdraw his Seventh and Eighth Armies (commanded by Fevzi Pasha and Kress von Kressenstein respectively) and move his headquarters <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to Nablus on 14 November. As the Ottoman III Corps (Seventh Army) reached Jerusalem via the Hebron road after its defeat at Beersheba, it was ordered to develop defences around Jerusalem. This corps held the city while the XX Corps retreated from Junction Station into the Judean Hills towards Jerusalem. As they retired the XX Corps left strong rearguards to stop or slow the British advance. Time was needed to construct defences and for reorganisation of the depleted and disorganised Seventh Army. When they arrived in the city XX Corps took over responsibility for Jerusalem's defences, while III Corps continued to move northwards <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> along the Nablus road.|$|E
5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|Following the Caliph's instructions, Yazid {{proceeded}} to Caesarea, {{and once again}} laid siege to the port city. Amr and Shurahbil marched to complete the occupation of Palestine, a task that was completed {{by the end of}} the year. Caesarea, however, could not be taken until 640, when at last, the garrison surrendered to Muawiyah I, then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to conquer all of northern Syria. This ended with the conquest of Antioch in late 637. In 639, the Muslims invaded and conquered Egypt.|$|E

5|$|In 1179, William {{was one of}} {{the delegates}} <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> and the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, {{archbishop}} of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. William was absent <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> for two years, returning home in 1180.|$|E

5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful {{speech to the}} crowd in the company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|E
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E

The pro-Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to the Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E

Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and {{the freedom of the}} Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
5|$|The 21st century {{began with}} two more cup titles for Maccabi Tel Aviv, before two seasons in a row saw {{respective}} firsts for the Israel State Cup. In 2003 Hapoel Ramat Gan became the first side to win the cup final from outside the top division, {{and a year later}} Bnei Sakhnin became the first club from a mostly Arab-Israeli town to lift the trophy. Three more second-tier clubs, Hapoel Haifa, Maccabi Herzliya and Hapoel Ashkelon, reached the final in 2004, 2005 and 2007 respectively, but none of these won the deciding match. Following Bnei Sakhnin's victory teams <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> and Tel Aviv reclaimed dominance—Maccabi Tel Aviv lifted the cup in 2005, Beitar Jerusalem won two titles in a row in 2008 and 2009 and Hapoel Tel Aviv twice in a row in 2006 and 2007, and then three times consecutively from 2010 to 2012.

5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their own hands. Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders <b>from</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E
