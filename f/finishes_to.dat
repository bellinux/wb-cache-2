5|$|Richmond raced {{for three}} teams in 1981. He started the season by {{competing}} in 15 events for Ulrich. He {{had his first}} career top 10 finish, taking sixth place at Talladega Superspeedway, soon followed by a seventh-place finish at Texas World Speedway. After Kennie Childers hired him away from Ulrich mid-season, Richmond had top 10 finishes at Pocono and Bristol. For the final seven races of the season, he drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International Speedway. Overall for the season, Richmond had six top 10 <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> place 16th in season points.|$|E
5|$|Loeb's win was {{his fourth}} at Monte Carlo and twenty-ninth in WRC.

5|$|Hornish {{moved to}} Penske's NASCAR program {{part-time}} in the Xfinity Series (then {{known as the}} Busch Series) during the 2006 season, and began driving part-time in the Sprint Cup Series (then known as the Nextel Cup Series) in 2007. He raced full-time in the Sprint Cup Series the following year, struggling at first, with eight top-ten finishes over his first three seasons and a top points placing of 28th (in 2009). Hornish returned part-time to the Xfinity Series (then known as the Nationwide Series) in 2011, winning one race. He drove full-time in the series the following year, finishing fourth in points. In 2012 Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger (suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test) in Penske's No. 22 car midway through the season, earning one top-five finish. The following year {{he returned to the}} Nationwide Series, winning one race and earning 16 top-five and 24 top-ten <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> place second in points (three behind series champion Austin Dillon). Hornish drove part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing in an eight-race 2014 season, with one win and four top-five finishes. He returned to the Cup Series in 2015 with Richard Petty Motorsports, scoring three top-tens and finishing 26th in points. He returned part-time to the Xfinity Series in 2016, winning a race for JGR and finishing sixth or better in all three races he entered for Richard Childress Racing. In 2017, he returned to Penske's Xfinity program for a three-race schedule in the No. 22.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, the Taupō Bypass was {{constructed}} shifting the original SH 1 from the township and lakeside {{to the eastern}} outskirts of Taupō. The bypass starts at Wairakei near the existing SH 1/SH 5 intersection and <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> the north of Taupō Airport. The concurrency with SH 5 also follows part of the bypass.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the efforts}} of {{acquisitions}} researchers and professional museum staff, and donations of individuals, many original Palace objects have been returned. Government grants and private donations funded reproduction of original fabrics and <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> restore Palace rooms to their monarchy era appearance.

In the basement is a photographic display of the Palace, orders and decorations given by the monarchs, and an exhibit outlining restoration efforts.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{construction}} is prevalent among {{the homes and}} buildings in Scales Mound. Adam Rittweger constructed numerous distinctive concrete porches, garages, and foundations between 1908 and his death in 1933. There are several surviving examples of poured concrete constructed buildings in Scales Mound including the 1923 one story electrical generating plant, and Lewis Richard's 1911 restaurant. There is one surviving example in Scales Mound of a stucco clad and poured concrete construction combination, Louis Durrstein's implement dealership. It is presumed that Rittweger also introduced stucco <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> Scales Mound between the late 1900s and early 1910s.|$|E
25|$|By 1903, Kosyakov {{brothers}} {{produced a}} complete album containing nearly a thousand graphic sheets detailing the structure, exterior and internal design of yet unbuilt cathedral. Physically, the graphics were executed by Georgy Kosyakov. Plan, structure, external outline is credited to Vasily Kosyakov; detailed artwork of interior <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> Georgy. Interior features were clearly influenced by Art Nouveau, skillfully {{integrated into a}} Byzantine shell and complemented with modern engineering systems. Vasily Kosyakov’s layout also demonstrates influence of Romanesque architecture, notably in the twin belltowers by {{the sides of the}} main portal — an extremely uncommon feature in Russian practice.|$|E

25|$|Demolition {{work was}} {{conducted}} by demolition contractors who competed for the various contracts offered by the HAT. The complexity of these contracts led to confusion sometimes between the contractors and the HAT. In one case, between the HAT and Demolition Services Ltd., where Demolition Services Ltd. had been contracted to demolish two 13-storey tower blocks and remove asbestos from the insulation panels, legal advice was sought by the contractor after they discovered further asbestos in the <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> the ceilings, walls and floors. Demolition Services Ltd. wanted an additional payment of £300,000 but the HAT argued that the removal of these features {{were part of the}} contract. Nonetheless, the HAT were forced to make the additional payment in court.|$|E
25|$|Harvick {{started the}} season by {{finishing}} {{second in the}} Daytona 500. At Atlanta, he led 116 laps, but finished second to Jimmie Johnson. At Las Vegas, Harvick held off Martin Truex, Jr. to win his first race of the season. It was also his first win at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Harvick won again the very next week for his fourth straight win at Phoenix and a record seventh win at the track overall. At Auto Club, Harvick managed to finish second, this time to Brad Keselowski. This brought his streak of Top 2 <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> eight races overall. It appeared Harvick was on track to tie Richard Petty for most straight Top 2 finishes, but this streak {{came to an end}} with an eighth-place finish at Martinsville.|$|E
25|$|The {{first race}} {{of the season in}} Australia saw Irvine {{involved}} in a race ending first lap crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. At the next race in Brazil, he could only manage sixteenth place, having found his car difficult to drive. Two weeks later he finished a career high second place in Argentina, where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for the lead, who was suffering with a stomach ailment, and his car with brake problems. The result ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine to be sacked. A third place at the next race in San Marino, and another in Monaco two weeks later, gave Irvine his best string of <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> date. At the Spanish Grand Prix Irvine finished only twelfth and was given a 10-second stop-go penalty, after he held up Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi when running a lap down.|$|E

25|$|Busch {{started off}} the 2016 season {{bringing}} home a 10th-place {{finish in the}} Daytona 500 and winning two consecutive poles for the Atlanta and Las Vegas. However, {{he was given the}} pole position for the former at Atlanta because his brother, Kyle Busch, earned that spot in qualifying but started dead-last after his time was disallowed due to failing post-qualifying inspection. He got his first and only victory of the season at Pocono, ironically the only race of the season when his crew chief Tony Gibson was suspended. Busch had a very consistent season, breaking a record for most consecutive lead-lap <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> start the year. His streak ended, however, when he got his first DNF of the season during the 23rd race at Bristol after suffering contact from Joey Logano. He remained in top ten in points throughout the year and finished 7th in the championship standings.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Rude and Madusa left The Dangerous Alliance and feuded with Nikita Koloff. Rude {{challenged}} reigning World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons {{on several}} occasions but failed to win the title. In December 1992, Rude suffered a legitimate neck injury {{and was forced to}} forfeit the United States Championship, thus ending his reign of nearly 14 months, a reign that still stands today as the second longest reign in the almost 40-year history of the title. Rude returned alone in April 1993 and tried to reclaim the title from Dustin Rhodes, who had won it while he was injured. The title was eventually held up after several controversial <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> matches between the two. After a 30-minute Iron Man Match ended in a 1-1 draw at Beach Blast on July 18, a best-of-three series was set between the two on Saturday Night; Rude won the first match on August 28, but lost to Rhodes twice on September 4 and 11, losing his chance at regaining the U.S. title.|$|E
25|$|Elliott was {{replaced}} by rookie driver Kasey Kahne, a successful open-wheel racer just starting to gain respect in the Busch Series, who left a development contract with Ford to sign with Evernham's Dodge team for the 2004 season. Tommy Baldwin, Jr. would serve as crew chief for the No. 9 team. Kahne was arguably the least accomplished driver in a strong rookie class that included Busch Series winners Brian Vickers (the 2003 Champion), Scott Riggs, Scott Wimmer, and Johnny Sauter as well as Craftsman Truck Series winner Brendan Gaughan. Kahne would have the strongest performance {{out of all the}} young drivers, earning three second-place finishes through the first eleven races and five on the season, including two close finishes with Matt Kenseth and Elliott Sadler. Kahne earned four poles and 14 Top 10 <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> score a 13th-place finish in points, winning the Rookie of the Year honors by over 100 points. In 2005, he won the spring Richmond race, but finished a disappointing 23rd in the final point standings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1879, the {{drawings}} were sent to Sir William Pearce of John Elder & Co. Pearce agreed to build it, and in August Tsar Alexander II gave his assent. Pearce {{and the head of}} the Baltic Shipyard Mikhail Casi, representing Alexander II, signed the contract on September 5, 1879. Pearce agreed to complete the job by July 1, 1880. The deal excluded interior <b>finishes,</b> <b>to</b> be completed in Russia. Unusually for the period, Pearce agreed to guarantee the speed of an experimental craft. According to the contract, the full price was payable only if the ship attained 15 knots. Under-performance was punishable by hefty liquidated damages, and the Russians reserved the right for a full money back guarantee if the ship failed to make 14 knots. They agreed to pay generous premiums if speed and engine power exceeded design targets of 15 knots and 12,000 indicated horsepowers. Pearce was instructed to build his own state-of-the-art steam engines, with no cap on maximum power output. The Russians subscribed to supply the complete electrical system, including arc lighting by Yablochkov candles. The British press discussed the unusual project and concluded it was a test bed for future military ships and their powerplants in particular.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki passed Dale Jarrett with 27laps {{left at the}} Food City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take {{a narrow}} victory. It was his fourthWinston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the topfive in season points. Andrews {{attributed}} Kulwicki's consistently strong <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, [...] "It was hard to control them, and the driver's ability to work with that car during practice {{in order to get}} the car set up meant so much more than it ever did." [...] Kulwicki's second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention. He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th.|$|E
500|$|Australian riders won each of {{the lesser}} jersey awards. Evans won the points classification, {{represented}} in 2010 with a red jersey in {{a return to the}} original colour scheme for the three minor classifications that reflected the colours of the Italian flag. Evans's victory came about by way of nine top-ten finishes, including a stage win, {{over the course of the}} race. This classification was tightly contested throughout the race; six different riders held the jersey, and it changed hands nine times. Matthew Lloyd of [...] won the green jersey for the mountains classification, taking maximum mountains points during his stage-winning breakaway in stage 6. He made morning breakaways later on in mountain stages to take points on other climbs and consolidate his lead. Porte won the white jersey as best young rider, holding it for all but three stages. Success was widespread among the 22 teams in the race. In sharp contrast to the 2009 Giro, the only rider to win multiple stages in this year's race was Farrar, who took the sprint <b>finishes</b> <b>to</b> stages 2 and 10. , , , , , , , and [...] each won one stage. [...] had two stage wins, first with Wouter Weylandt in a depleted sprint finish to stage 3 in the Netherlands, and two stages later Jérôme Pineau led a winning breakaway across the finish line. 's Chris Anker Sørensen won stage 8 on Monte Terminillo after figuring into a morning breakaway, and their time trial specialist Gustav Larsson won the final race against the clock in Verona. [...] won multiple sprint stages, first with leadout man Matthew Goss when ace sprinter André Greipel missed out on the opportunity, and later Greipel himself took a win. [...] took back-to-back stage wins, first with Petrov in L'Aquila and then with Filippo Pozzato, who won a 10-man sprint after a late breakaway in stage 12. After there had been no Italian stage winners for the first 11 days of racing, Pozzato's stage win was the first of five in a row and six overall for Italian riders. Nibali and Basso were among those stage winners; as they also won the stage 4 team time trial, theirs was the only squad with more than two stage wins. They also won both teams classifications, the time-based Trofeo Fast Team and the points-based Trofeo Super Team. , , and [...] did not win any stages, but Vinokourov's and Arroyo's stints in the pink jersey and Tom Stamsnijder's win in the Traguardo Volante classification meant that they did not come away from the Giro empty-handed. Only , , , , and [...] came away from the Giro with nothing, even though Milram had one of their riders (Paul Voss) wearing the Mountains jersey at some point.|$|E
