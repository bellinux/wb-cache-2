5|$|For {{purposes}} of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There {{is a mixture of}} high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.|$|E

The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b> The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|At the {{designated}} time of 05:25, the British opened {{up with an}} artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man's land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong point {{to the east of}} Augustus Wood in the centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him under fire <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, {{and created a}} unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a full, {{360-degree}} field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, {{and behind the}} dragon. Enemies come <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.|$|E

Pythagoras theorem (3 - 4 - 5) was followed by leaving 1  m space <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>direction</b> to control border effects (Mengistu et al. 2014).

5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b> The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

Furthermore, its establishment is the first in the district of Batang Padang, which will help the education sector in the district to surge.

25|$|A spherical {{secondary}} {{can achieve}} higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes in <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> toward the same spot.

The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields {{of a few hundred}} kilotons.|$|E

25|$|Windscreens (or {{windshields}} – {{the terms}} are interchangeable) {{provide a method}} of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.|$|E
