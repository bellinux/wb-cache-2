5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we <b>do</b> <b>say,</b> and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you <b>do</b> <b>say,</b> but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

Pinker further argued {{that since the}} ten most {{frequently}} occurring English verbs (be, have, <b>do,</b> <b>say,</b> make ...) are all irregular, while 98.2% of [...] the thousand least common verbs are regular, there is a [...] "massive correlation" [...] of frequency and irregularity. He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has {{to be committed to}} memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized. Any irregular verb that falls in popularity past a certain point is lost, and all future generations will treat it as a regular verb instead.|$|E

500|$|In 1940 Tunis {{received}} $200 {{from his}} publisher {{to visit the}} Dodgers' spring training camp in Clearwater, Florida. He then began work on his first baseball novel. The Kid from Tomkinsville became {{the first in a}} series of eight books about the Brooklyn Dodgers. In it, Tunis introduced rookie pitcher Roy Tucker and his teammates: [...] "Bones" [...] Hathaway, [...] "Razzle" [...] Nugent and [...] "Fat Stuff" [...] Foster. Tunis says in a note at the beginning of the book that [...] "all the characters in this book were drawn from real life." [...] Though his papers only list Tucker as [...] "Number 36", they <b>do</b> <b>say</b> that, among others, [...] "Gabby" [...] Gus was based on Leo Durocher and Tucker's Rabbi was inspired by Luke Sewell. Kirkus gave it another starred review, saying it [...] "struck a new note". Tucker's story continues in 1941's World Series.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Darren Gawle of Drop-D magazine criticised the lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths, stating: [...] "The only shocking thing about Black Eye {{lies in a}} band trying to pass themselves off as Riot Grrls {{when in fact they}} pack as much 'Grrr' as a slightly vexed Yorkshire Terrier." [...] In contrast, Colin Weston of Drowned in Sound commented: [...] "The thing about Fluffy, is they aren't the most lyrically challenging of bands, but their music more then [...] makes up for it, and what they <b>DO</b> <b>say,</b> you understand immediately... not messing about with 'Deep and meaningful' lyrics, these girls have got something to say, and say it the only way they know how... in your face!!!" [...] Although Black Eye was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996, Christgau placed it at number 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I <b>do</b> <b>say</b> gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: [...] "It is a lamentable fact if, in {{the midst}} of our civilisation, and {{at the close of the}} nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious {{labourer}} at the end of a long and honourable life. I do not enter into the question now in detail. I do not say it is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but I <b>do</b> <b>say</b> this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members".

2500|$|Paleoanthropological {{estimates}} of the time frame {{for the evolution of}} monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism. [...] According to Reno et al., the sexual dimorphism of Australopithecus afarensis, a human ancestor from approximately 3.9–3.0 million years ago, was within the modern human range, based on dental and postcranial morphology. [...] Although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids, the authors <b>do</b> <b>say</b> that reduced levels of sexual dimorphism in A. afarensis “do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny”. [...] However, Gordon, Green and Richmond claim that in examining postcranial remains, A. afarensis is more sexually dimorphic than modern humans and chimps with levels closer to those of orangutans and gorillas. [...] Furthermore, Homo habilis, living approximately 2.3 mya, is the most sexually dimorphic early hominid. [...] Plavcan and van Schaik conclude their examination of this controversy by stating that, overall, sexual dimorphism in australopithecines is not indicative of any behavioral implications or mating systems.|$|E

2500|$|The Use and {{application}} of maxims is clearly a location where the principles of Irish law could be recorded. Any number of maxims may be found within the Early Irish Laws and perhaps {{the reason why we}} are unable to derive a coherent theory of law from them is because there are a great many different topics. Some do seem to represent a legal theory, such as the maxim in Bechbretha that [...] "no-one is obliged to give something to another for nothing" [...] and that in Bretha Crólige that [...] "the misdeed of the guilty should not affect the innocent". These maxims <b>do</b> <b>say</b> more than one might think since legal systems often have problems balancing the interests of all. The majority of maxims, however, treat with more specific problems. The main problem, however, with our understanding of maxims is that while one law text tells us that they were used as a basis of judgment we know little else about them; we do not even know how exactly maxims could be used for judgment. A further complication is that we know very little about the origin of maxims (or even what the jurists thought was the origin) and similarly we do not know whether jurists were introducing new maxims regularly or whether all maxims were supposed to be from time immemorial.|$|E
