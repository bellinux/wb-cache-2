50|$|The saffron siskin {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 10 to 10.5 cm. Like other siskins, the colours of this bird are black, olive and yellow, with black wings with a {{prominent}} yellow band on the bases of the flight feathers and another on the wing coverts. The male differs from the male <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus magellanica) in having an unstreaked, golden-olive back and bright yellow underparts. The female differs from the female <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> by being altogether yellower, with yellow underparts rather than grey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus magellanicus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family (Fringillidae), {{native to}} South America. It belongs to the putative clade of Neotropical siskins in the genus Spinus sensu lato.|$|E
50|$|The thick-billed siskin has {{an adult}} length of between 13.5 and 14 cm. The bill often has a silvery base and is {{noticeable}} thicker than other related siskins. The male closely resembles the <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> (Carduelis magellanica) {{and has a}} black head and throat, greenish-yellow upper parts (sometimes streaked with dark markings) and bright yellow underparts. It differs from the <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> in having a whitish-grey midbelly. The immature male has a black head but is otherwise less conspicuous than the mature male, being more greyish-olive above and greyish below. The female is similar but lacks the black head and is altogether much duller in appearance, more greyish-olive, with paler underparts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hooded</b> <b>siskins</b> are 10 to 14 cm in length. The male {{is largely}} green above and yellow below {{with a black}} head. It has a narrow yellow collar and a yellow rump. The tail is black with yellow sides to the base and the wings are black with a broad yellow band. Females are duller with a {{green-brown}} head, yellow-green breast and sides and a whitish belly.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} green-and-yellow finch. According to some sources, it is the {{smallest}} species of finch on average, although others give this title to the lesser goldfinch. The total length can range from 9.5 to 11 cm. A weight of 11.5 g {{may be at the}} high end. Few standard measurements are known, although the bill has been recorded at 1.1 cm and the wing chord length is reportedly around 6.4 cm. The Andean siskin has deep green upperparts with black and yellow coloration on the wings and tail. The adult male has a distinctive black cap. Female lacks this cap and is generally a duller olive color, with white from the belly to the undertail-coverts. The female differs from female yellow-bellied siskin in being paler and brighter, also by lacking the olive throat and yellow undertail-coverts of that species. Female <b>hooded</b> <b>siskins</b> are also similar but the Andean has distinctive white undertail-coverts and more olive-green rather than gray color. The Andean siskin race S. s. nigricauda is generally duller or darker green on upperparts than the nominate, in this subspecies the underparts are dull green and lacking any trace of yellow. The tail is all black and the wings lack greenish-yellow tips to the coverts but the race does retain bright yellow bases to the inner primaries and secondaries. The race S. s. capitanea is similar but the underparts are generally paler olive without any of the dark olive centers to the feathers, it also has yellow on sides of the base of the tail and on the tips of the median and greater coverts.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cabecita negra" [...] (literally, {{little black}} head) is an oft-used, {{historic}} racist term in Argentina. The word was coined after the Spanish {{name of a}} native bird, the <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin.</b> It is used to disparage a somewhat nebulous sector of society associated with people that have black hair and medium-dark skin, belonging to the working class.|$|E
50|$|The {{behaviour}} of the saffron siskin {{is similar}} to that of the <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> but it usually occurs at lower elevations. It feeds mainly on plant material, such as seeds, leaves and buds, but also on insects, foraging among tall grasses and plants and on the ground. It breeds between January and May but little is known of its nesting habits.|$|E
50|$|The olivaceous siskin is an active, social species, usually seen {{in pairs}} or small groups, but {{sometimes}} forms larger flocks, especially in winter. It feeds on seeds, {{mainly on the}} ground and in low shrubs, but sometimes higher in trees. Its behaviour and appearance is generally {{similar to that of the}} <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> but they differ in range and habitat choice.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} common to locally common. It occurs in {{subtropical}} and p√°ramo zones of the northern Andes. The Andean siskins is usually found between elevations of 1800 and 3700 m, though occasionally ranges as low as 1500 m in Colombia. It inhabits scrub or low bushes in open cloud or elfin forests or {{along the edges of}} forests. It may also be seen on open hillsides with scattered trees or bushes and occasionally range to edges of cultivation. Usually, the Andean siskin is found in pairs or small flocks of up to 20, occasionally mixed with other species of finch, such as <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> in northern Ecuador. It often perches high in tops of trees, but generally feeds on or near the ground. This species feeds on a variety of plant seeds, with a particular fondness for Espeletia seeds and flowers.|$|E
50|$|The black-chinned siskin {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 13 cm. The male has the crown and {{the centre of the}} upper throat black. The rest of the head and the upper parts of the body are yellowish-olive {{streaked}} with black. The rump is yellow and the wings are black with two yellowish bars and a yellow patch on the primary feathers. The underparts are greenish-yellow and the belly is white. The appearance of the female is similar to the male but the colouring is more muted. She lacks the black on head and throat. The head and back are a greyish-olive above with pale yellowish-olive underparts and a whitish belly. The only other bird with which {{it is likely to be}} confused is the <b>hooded</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus magellanica); however, that bird is not found so far south, the male has a larger area of black on head and throat, and the female has a yellow rump.|$|E
