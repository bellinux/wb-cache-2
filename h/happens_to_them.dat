25|$|Crake tells Jimmy {{about another}} very {{important}} project, a Viagra-like super-pill called BlyssPluss, which also promises health and happiness, but secretly has other major and ultimately fatal effects. Crake officially hires Jimmy to help market it. At the Rejoov compound, Jimmy eventually sees a human in the Craker habitat and recognizes {{her as the}} girl from the pornographic video. Unaware of Jimmy's obsession with her, Crake explains that her name is Oryx {{and that he has}} hired her as a prostitute for himself and a teacher for the Crakers. Oryx notices Jimmy's feelings for her and makes herself sexually available to him. As their relationship progresses, Jimmy becomes increasingly fearful that Crake has found out about it. He also makes a promise to both Oryx and Crake that he will look after the Crakers if anything <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, {{is carried}} over {{directly}} from Valkyira Chronicles. During missions, players select each unit using a top-down {{perspective of the}} battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns {{at the expense of}} other characters' turns. Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out if something <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific [...] "Potentials", skills unique to each character. They are divided into [...] "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and [...] "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique [...] "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate [...] "Direct Command" [...] and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her [...] "Valkyria Form" [...] and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.|$|E
500|$|StarClan is a {{group of}} the Clans' {{deceased}} ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured).StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the Moonpool, a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can [...] "just get glimpses of" [...] the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they will fade away-it is unknown what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> after this.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have claimed that}} people think good things are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, whereas bad events were less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.But others {{have pointed out that}} prior work tended to examine good outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be rare (such as being struck by lightning).Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism. People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> than <b>to</b> others.|$|R

50|$|Another {{example of}} {{defensive}} attribution is optimism bias, {{in which people}} believe positive events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> more often than to others and that negative events <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> less often than to others.

2500|$|The book {{elicited}} both strongly {{supportive and}} strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included {{the contents of}} the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to Benedict Carey's story in The New York Times, [...] "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of political correctness on academic freedom." [...] Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist Alice Dreger argues that [...] "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself." ...|$|E

[...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country."

60|$|That this is so, we {{have some}} kind of {{evidence}} in our very bodies, all whose particles, whilst vitally united to this same thinking conscious self, so that WE FEEL when they are touched, and are affected by, and conscious of good or harm that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> are a part of ourselves; i.e. of our thinking conscious self. Thus, the limbs of his body are to every one a part of himself; he sympathizes and is concerned for them. Cut off a hand, and thereby separate it from that consciousness he had of its heat, cold, and other affections, and it is then no longer a part of that which is himself, any more than the remotest part of matter. Thus, we see the SUBSTANCE whereof personal self consisted at one time may be varied at another, without the change of personal identity; there being no question about the same person, though the limbs which but now were a part of it, be cut off.|$|E
