25|$|The EU <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax (EU FTT) is a {{proposal}} {{made by the}} European Commission in September 2011 to introduce a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax within the 27 member states of the European Union by 2014. The tax would only impact financial transactions between financial institutions charging 0.1% against the exchange of shares and bonds and 0.01% across derivative contracts. According to the European Commission it could raise €57 billion every year, of which around €10bn (£8.4bn) would go to Great Britain, which hosts Europe's biggest financial center. It is unclear whether a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax is compatible with European law.|$|E

25|$|Smart cards, often colloquially {{referred}} to as “chip cards” were {{designed to provide a}} more secure <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> than a traditional credit card. They contain simple embedded integrated circuits designed to performed cryptographic functions. They connect directly to a card reader which provides the power necessary to perform an encrypted <b>financial</b> <b>transaction.</b> Many side-channel attacks {{have been shown to be}} effective against smart cards because they obtain their power supply and clock directly from the card reader. By tampering with a card reader, it is simple to collect traces and perform side-channel attacks. Other works, however, have also shown that smart cards are vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks as well.|$|E
