5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 â€” barely a year after the mall's original opening. The <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E

50|$|Individual hinged <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> used in piping {{systems are}} {{restricted}} to pure angular rotation by its hinges. As a pair, hinged <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> will function together to absorb lateral deflection.

5000|$|Pipe <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are {{necessary}} in systems that convey high temperature substances such as steam or exhaust gases, or to absorb movement and vibration. A typical joint is a bellows of metal (most commonly stainless steel), plastic (such as PTFE), fabric (such as glass fibre) or an elastomer such as rubber. A bellows {{is made up}} of a series of convolutions, with the shape of the convolution designed to withstand the internal pressures of the pipe, but flexible enough to accept axial, lateral, and angular deflections. <b>Expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are also designed for other criteria, such as noise absorption, anti-vibration, earthquake movement, and building settlement. Metal <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> have to be designed according to rules laid out by EJMA, for fabric <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> there are guidelines and a state-of-the-art description by the Quality Association for Fabric <b>Expansion</b> <b>Joints.</b> Pipe <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are also known as [...] "compensators", as they compensate for the thermal movement.|$|R

25|$|Joints {{are used}} in {{continuous}} welded rail when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes straight across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut {{at an angle to}} give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an <b>expansion</b> <b>joint)</b> gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.|$|E
5000|$|The angular {{compensation}} of thermal expansion requires at least two, and for full compensation even three, angular <b>expansion</b> <b>joints.</b> Angular <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> offer {{a wide variety}} of combination options in so-called two-hinge or three-hinge systems.|$|R
5000|$|Lateral <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> permit angular {{movement}} around the bolts and hinge axes. This {{can be used}} to absorb pipe sag between the pipe supports. Lateral and angular <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are frequently combined in three-hinge systems.|$|R
5000|$|Doctor Muirs {{description}} of how <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> worked is inaccurate. The description in the show implies that the <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> {{played a significant role}} in the structural abilities of the ship. However, <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> were placed into the superstructure only, and not the primary form of her hull. The hull is what bore structural stresses, working in the sea, while the superstructure merely [...] "floated" [...] on top of the primary hull.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, an expedition, {{funded and}} filmed by the History Channel, brought {{together}} fourteen skilled divers {{to help determine}} what caused the quick sinking of Britannic. After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was kicked up, causing zero visibility conditions, and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on Britannics boiler room, but {{it was discovered that}} photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department within the Greek Ministry of Culture. Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented. Underwater Antiquities later recognised the importance of this mission and has since extended an invitation to revisit the wreck under less stringent rules. On this expedition, divers found a bulb shape in her <b>expansion</b> <b>joint.</b> This proved that her design was changed following the loss of Titanic.|$|E
25|$|By 2:15a.m., Lightoller, Moody {{and others}} were {{struggling}} to retrieve Collapsible Boats A and B from their places of storage {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters. They rigged up makeshift ramps from oars and spars down which they slid the boats onto the Boat Deck. Unfortunately for all concerned, the boat broke through the ramp and landed upside-down on the deck. It reached the Boat Deck upside-down but there was no time to right it as Titanic began her final break-up and plunge to the seabed. Water swept across the Boat Deck, washing the upside-down lifeboat and many people into the sea. Wireless operator Harold Bride found himself trapped underneath the overturned hull. Titanics increasing angle in the water and an opening <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> caused the stays supporting the forward funnel to snap and crash into the water, crushing swimmers in its path and pushing Collapsible B away from the sinking ship. As Titanic went under, the lifeboat was left in the midst of hundreds of people swimming in the water. Several dozen people climbed onto its hull, including Lightoller, who then took charge of it. Also aboard were Jack Thayer (whose mother was saved with her maid in Boat #4, but whose father died), military historian Colonel Archibald Gracie, who later wrote a popular account of the disaster, and Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Bride managed to escape from the air pocket beneath the boat and made it onto the hull.|$|E

[...] A minor landslide near the freeway caused some traffic congestion, but structural damage were reported. Caltrans replaced an <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> on an Interstate 5 truck overpass at the El Toro Y Interchange. [...] The roof of Placentia's public library nearly collapsed; afterwards, the building was closed for repairs.|$|E
50|$|In highly {{variable}} climates which undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles, the concrete blocks will be separated by <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> {{to allow for}} thermal expansion without breakage. The use of <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> in sidewalks may not be necessary, as the concrete will shrink while setting.|$|R
5000|$|Because angular <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> (as hinged <b>expansion</b> <b>joints)</b> {{themselves}} {{absorb the}} compressive forces {{released by the}} bellows, the fixed points in the pipeline are only loaded by their adjusting forces and torques, by the frictional forces of the pipe guides and by the flow forces.|$|R

500|$|The bow hit {{the bottom}} {{at a speed}} of about , digging about [...] deep into the mud, up {{to the base of}} the anchors. The impact bent the hull in two places and caused it to buckle {{downwards}} by about 10Â° under the forward well deck cranes and by about 4Â° under the forward <b>expansion</b> <b>joint.</b> When the bow section hit the sea bed, the weakened decks at the rear, where the ship had broken apart, collapsed on top of each other. The forward hatch cover was also blown off and landed a couple of hundred feet in front of the bow, possibly due to the force of water being pushed out as the bow impacted the bottom.|$|E
500|$|The arch varies between [...] wide by [...] deep at {{the bases}} to [...] wide and [...] deep at the top.

The deck {{is supported by}} piled abutments, which incorporate areas for bearing and <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> inspection and maintenance. The arch is kept in shape by a number of internal stiffeners and diaphragms, with the top section filled with concrete. To minimise internal rust, the lower sections of the arch were coated with a vapour corrosion inhibitor, with portholes with removable covers inserted into the arch so that the inside can have additional coats applied in the future.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the Republic of Belarus {{the roads}} {{with a high}} {{intensity}} of transport most widely employ <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> with rubber and steel compensators fastened to the reinforced concrete base with embedded therein studs. While operated <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are exposed to various kinds of operational and climatic impacts causing their damage. <b>Expansion</b> <b>joints</b> destruction results in {{a sharp increase in}} dynamic effects of transport on the structural elements of a bridge with the pavement most affected {{in the area of the}} junction. Since the greatest stresses occur in the area of the <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> fastened to the concrete base leading to its destruction it is suggested using high-strength concrete able to receive elastically the dynamic loading. In this case the content of joints comes down to a timely tightening of nuts and their sealing.

2500|$|Long also {{suspected}} that Titanics breakup {{may have begun}} with the premature failure of the ship's after <b>expansion</b> <b>joint,</b> and ultimately exacerbated {{the loss of life}} by causing Titanic to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on Titanics younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of Britannics expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the Titanic. To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary Titanic's Achilles Heel, partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that Titanics expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. [...] They played no role in the breaking of the hull. [...] They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.|$|E
