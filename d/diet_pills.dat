Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E

25|$|Unresearched nonprescription {{products}} or programs {{for weight loss}} are heavily promoted by mail and print advertising and on the internet. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends caution with use of these products, {{since many of the}} claims of safety and effectiveness are unsubstantiated. Individuals with anorexia nervosa and some athletes try to control body weight with laxatives, <b>diet</b> <b>pills</b> or diuretic drugs, although these generally have no impact on body fat. Products that work as a laxative can cause the blood's potassium level to drop, which may cause heart and/or muscle problems. Pyruvate is a popular product that may result in a small amount of weight loss. However, pyruvate, which is found in red apples, cheese, and red wine, has not been thoroughly studied and its weight loss potential has not been scientifically established.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse <b>diet</b> <b>pills,</b> and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé is then {{announced}} by the contest's host as [...] "Miss 3rd Ward", and she then appears on stage, smiling and singing the first verse of the song a cappella.

5000|$|When Peer-to-Peer {{become a}} popular way to {{download}} music in mid-2000s, My <b>Diet</b> <b>Pill</b> fans used unusual promotional techniques: they included copies of the band's songs inside archives of other bands' music that are distributed on file sharing networks such as eMule. This {{had the advantage of}} giving them targeted exposure to fans of similar bands, and downloaders were likely to give this free music a chance even if they'd never heard of the band. This gave My <b>Diet</b> <b>Pill</b> unexpected popularity which resulted in a raise of album sales, merchandising and the creation of fan-clubs (in Argentina and France).|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. And it felt like we had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming <b>diet</b> <b>pills</b> and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{different}} standards of beauty {{for men and}} women, men are often not diagnosed as anorexic. Generally men who alter their bodies do so to be lean and muscular rather than thin. In addition, men who might otherwise be diagnosed with anorexia may not meet the DSM IV [...] criteria for BMI since they have muscle weight, but have very little fat. [...] Men and women athletes are often overlooked as anorexic. Research emphasizes the importance to take athletes' diet, weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia, [...] instead of just looking at weight and BMI. For athletes, ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on weight, which may promote the development of eating disorders among them. [...] While women use <b>diet</b> <b>pills,</b> which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder, men use steroids, which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders. This also shows men having a preoccupation with their body, which is an indicator of an eating disorder. In a Canadian study, 4% of boys in grade nine used anabolic steroids. Anorexic men are {{sometimes referred to as}} manorexic.|$|E

Hassan continued that it does not cross Lynsey's mind that Silas would want to hurt Cheryl, but opined that [...] "the penny will eventually drop for her". The actress added that Silas is trying to [...] "blacken" [...] Lynsey's name. Discussing the storyline, Waugh later promised that there would be some [...] "really good" [...] stuff coming up.
