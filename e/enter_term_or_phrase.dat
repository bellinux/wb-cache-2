40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the 'orientation' of {{multiple}} lexical terms and special language verb phrases. Orientation is a necessary step for two main reasons: ascertaining the most logical placing of multiple lexical terms and special language verb phrases (combinants) in a dictionary; providing the most apposite terminological and terminographical background data for a multiple lexical <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase,</b> these data being determined by the subject field of the text in which the <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> appears. The research has drawn together aspects such as collocation and valency, and analyses of corpora {{have resulted in the}} development of a model for special language verb phrases in English and French which it is proposed can be applied and adapted to different specialised subject fields. Past research into special language verb phrases has been sparse and, in contrast to general language, it does not appear that a model pertaining to this construction has been developed previously. Of additional novelty is the application of the model to special language verb phrases in French, because it is hoped that the results will act as a precursor for a dictionary of verb collocations in that language. It is intended that the results of the research will benefit: learners of a foreign language who may become translators, to enable them to seek a <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> easily and efficiently; subject specialists who prepare papers in a language which is not their mother tongue; technical writers; pre-editors of texts for machine translation; terminographers who need guidelines for <b>entering</b> compound <b>terms</b> and phrases in: (i) printed dictionaries and (ii) computerised systems such as terminology data banks (term banks). The results are supported by statistical data acquired from the compilation by the author of two special language corpora, one in English and the other in French, of restricted areas of virology and bacteriology...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we propose a novel {{approach}} were 3 days of raw Yahoo! News search query logs are analyzed to find semantic relations among queries. The analysis is based on two independent contributions. The first use session data extracted from the query logs. By finding the term best describing each session, we get a vocabulary of queries related to that term. Sessions with similar terms are merged to create larger groups of queries with one common <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase.</b> The second contribution {{is the use of}} temporal correlation to give a measure of frequency variation similarity. Queries that show a similar variation over time have a high chance of either being semantically related or appear in the same situations. These two contributions are then merged into related term groups, based on their session group label and the most prominent <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> of the correlation query. With the use of non strict parameter settings on the contribution calculations, a great number of queries are found. With the intersection of the results this leaves high accuracy groups of related queries with a <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> as group label. A prototype search application was developed to use the created term groups in a search environment. The groups of queries were converted into a tree structure with their group label as the main node. This navigation tree structure let the user navigate {{up and down in the}} tree or click directly on a tree node to view its results. When a users search match one of the generated groups, he or she is presented with the first search results of the trees main node together with its children. </p...|$|R

50|$|A gag {{name is a}} {{false name}} used to elicit humour through its {{simultaneous}} resemblance to a real name on the one hand, and to a <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> that is funny, strange, or vulgar on the other hand.

5000|$|Another {{problem for}} {{abstinence}} {{education is the}} definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like [...] "postponing sex" [...] or [...] "never had vaginal sex," [...] while also using moralistic <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> like virgin, chaste, and [...] "making a commitment". This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including mutual masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed technical virginity.|$|R

The editors were clearly more interested in presenting Roosevelt's thought than in producing a guide to familiar quotations, though most of the famous quotations were included in the book. The quotations given are often lengthy, thereby preserving much of the original context, and providing an accurate view of Roosevelt's thinking.|$|R

30|$|Level 3 – Major Difficulty: A {{significant}} {{departure from}} the source language {{would be necessary to}} render the item into the target language. Examples include having no corresponding <b>term</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> with the same meaning (or scope of meaning) as the original source text, or making an addition or omission necessary in order to convey the same concept as the source text. For example, an available idiom or more than one term might be necessary to match the scope of meaning of a source item. Also, the item may contain words that would typically be translated with a term already used elsewhere in the questionnaire (which have distinct meanings in the source language but are expressed with a single term in the target language).|$|R
5000|$|Through to the 1950s and 1960s, {{discussions in}} {{translation}} studies tended to concern {{how best to}} attain [...] "equivalence". The term [...] "equivalence" [...] had two distinct meanings, corresponding to different schools of thought. In the Russian tradition, [...] "equivalence" [...] was usually a one-to-one correspondence between linguistic forms, or a pair of authorized technical <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrases,</b> such that [...] "equivalence" [...] was opposed {{to a range of}} [...] "substitutions". However, in the French tradition of Vinay and Darbelnet, drawing on Bally, [...] "equivalence" [...] was the attainment of equal functional value, generally requiring changes in form. Catford's notion of equivalence in 1965 was as in the French tradition. In the course of the 1970s, Russian theorists adopted the wider sense of [...] "equivalence" [...] as something resulting from linguistic transformations.|$|R

Counseling psychologists share with others the occupational requirement of {{having to deal with}} uncertainty in test results and communicate it to others. The use and meaning of probabilistic expressions used in the context of psychological test interpretation is investigated. Specifically, the quantitative meanings of verbal probability expressions used in two different assessment reports are examined with a goal of describing the variability of meanings ascribed to probabilistic <b>terms</b> <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> used within the reports.
