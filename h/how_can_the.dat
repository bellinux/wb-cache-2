25|$|The {{question}} is, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> {{differences between}} social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less}} likely to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. The issues are currently being investigated.|$|E
25|$|<b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> {{accelerating}} frame {{be discovered}} to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything {{appears to be}} subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather {{it is based on the}} simplicity of the physical explanation for this compression.|$|E

500|$|Biographers have characterised Pick {{as being}} [...] "very shy", and [...] "brilliant but lonely". Christian Barman {{described}} {{him as a person}} who inspired conflicting opinions about his personality and his actions: [...] "a man about whom so many people held so many different views". Pick acknowledged that he could be difficult to work with: [...] "I have always kept in mind my own frailties – a short temper. Impatience with fools, quickness rather than thoroughness. I am a bad hand at the gracious word or casual congratulation." [...] His moralistic character led to friends giving him the nickname [...] "Jonah". Pick valued criticism and savoured challenging debate, though he complained that he found it difficult to get people to stand up to him. UERL board member Sir Ernest Clark considered Pick to be perhaps too efficient and unable to fully delegate and relinquish responsibility: [...] "his own efficiency has a bad effect on the efficiency of others... <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> housemaid take pride in a job to which the mistress will insist on putting the finishing touch?"

2500|$|..... the {{difficulty}} in the Ramban which says that the mitzva of kibush prevails in our time against the oath, dissolves. The oath, shelo yaalu bechoma means explicitly that we cannot storm eretz-Yisrael from chutz-laaretz. But when the Jews are in eretz-Yisrael, there is surely a hechsher mitzva of kibbush-haaretz. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> Jews be in eretz-Yisrael without the aliyah [...] "bechoma"?

There was never an oath upon the people who were in eretz-Yisrael.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 the Jaynes–Cummings {{model was}} {{developed}} describing {{the system of}} a two-level atom interacting with a quantized field mode (i.e. the vacuum) within an optical cavity. It gave nonintuitive predictions such as that an atom's spontaneous emission could be driven by field of effectively constant frequency (Rabi frequency). In the 1970s experiments were being performed to test aspects of quantum optics and showed {{that the rate of}} spontaneous emission of an atom could be controlled using reflecting surfaces. These results were at first regarded with suspicion in some quarters: it was argued that no modification of a spontaneous emission rate would be possible, after all, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>the</b> emission of a photon be affected by an atom's environment when the atom can only [...] "see" [...] its environment by emitting a photon in the first place? These experiments gave rise to cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), the study of effects of mirrors and cavities on radiative corrections. Spontaneous emission can be suppressed (or [...] "inhibited") or amplified. Amplification was first predicted by Purcell in 1946 (the Purcell effect) and has been experimentally verified. This phenomenon can be understood, partly, in terms of the action of the vacuum field on the atom.|$|E
