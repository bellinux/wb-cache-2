50|$|Interesterified fat {{is a type}} of oil {{where the}} fatty acids have been moved from one {{triglyceride}} molecule to another.

50|$|Yudkin’s {{interest}} in sugar arose indirectly from his {{studies of the}} alarming increase in many countries {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century in the incidence of coronary thrombosis. This increase was of great concern to health professionals, and it was widely attributed to an increase in the amount of fat, or of a particular type of fat, in the diet. In a paper published in 1957 Yudkin analysed diets and coronary mortality in different countries for the year 1952, and also analysed trends in diet, and trends in coronary mortality, in the UK between 1928 and 1954. The first of these analyses produced no evidence for the view that total fat, or animal fat, or <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> was the direct cause of coronary thrombosis; in fact the closest relationship between coronary deaths and any single dietary factor was with sugar. The second analysis, that of historical trends in the UK, found no good relationship with any single dietary factor. Instead, it suggested that some change or changes in lifestyle during the past several decades was contributing to the increased incidence of coronary deaths. One obvious change was reduced exercise, and another was alterations in diet.|$|E
5000|$|Recently, {{in a study}} {{funded by}} the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Sundram et al. [...] {{compared}} the effects of three types of fat: native palm olein, a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils. They concluded both the IE blend and the partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> blend increased the fasting ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p<0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p<0.05). As was pointed out {{in a letter to}} the Editor by Destaillats et al., a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition. The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein. The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets (Mensink 2003).|$|E

5000|$|Commonly, {{the natural}} oils are {{hydrogenated}} by passing hydrogen through {{the oil in}} the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus [...] "hardening" [...] it. This is due to the increase in van der Waals' forces between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines made in this way are said to contain <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat.</b> This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium. If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the [...] "trans" [...] form. If these particular bonds aren't hydrogenated during the process, they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats, the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. For this reason, partially hardened fats are used less and less in the margarine industry. Some tropical oils, such as palm oil and coconut oil, are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the lipid profiles of the hepatic and adipose tissues of Wistar rats treated for 21 days with a diet high in saturated fat (high saturated fat, n= 6) or high in <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> that is, having 50 % partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in its composition (high <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> n= 6), and compare them to those of a control group (control group, n= 6). METHODS: Adipose tissue and total hepatic fat were higher in the saturated fat group than in the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was greatest in the saturated fat group, with consequent lower hepatic vitamin E and A levels. In contrast, serum vitamin A was highest in the saturated fat group. Analysis of hepatic lipid fractions found more cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. The <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group had the highest levels of triacylglycerols, followed by the saturated fat group. RESULTS: Significant amounts of trans fatty acids were detected in the hepatic and adipose tissues of the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Among the identified fatty acids, 18 : 1 n 9 had a higher positive association with hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and a higher negative association with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil promotes greater accumulation of cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the liver than saturated fats. CONCLUSION: Trans fatty acids were incorporated into hepatocytes and adipocytes in a highly efficient manner...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-Two {{vegetable}} fats {{commonly used in}} commercial and home deep-fat frying of foods, and fractions thereoF, were tested for carcinogenicity in NIH Black rats. The following fractions of fresh and heated (used re-peatedly for deep-fat frying) hydrogenated vegetable fat and corn oil were prepared and tested: urea adduct, non urea adduct, nonsaponifiable fraction, and volatiles. Intramuscular injections of the non urea adducts of fresh and heated <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> and of corn oil, repeated every 2 weeks for 14 - 17 months, induced sarcomas {{at the site of}} injection in NIH Black rats. The incidence was higher in rats receiving the non urea adducts from corn oil than from <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> and higher also in the nonurea adducts from heated than from fresh fats. Few tumors, except papillomas of the forestomach, were induced in the alimentary tract or at other sites in 426 rats by the daily feeding for 17 months of fresh and heated fats and the urea and non urea adducts of corn oil, with and without added benzo[a]pyrene.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} fat type {{in the structure of}} ice cream, during its production by means of rheo-optical analysis. Fat plays an important part in the ice cream structure formation. It's responsible for the air stabilization, flavor release, texture and melting properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} use a rheological method to predict the fat network formation in ice cream with three types of fats (hydrogenated, low trans and palm fat). The three formulations were produced using the same methodology and ratio of ingredients. Rheo-optical measurements were taken before and after the ageing process, and the maximum compression force, overrun and melting profile were calculated in the finished product. The rheological analysis showed a better response from the ageing process from the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> followed by the low trans fat. The formulation with palm fat showed greater differences between the three, where through the rheological tests a weaker destabilization of the fat globule membrane by the emulsifier was suggested. The overrun, texture measurements and meltdown profile has shown the distinction on the structure formation by the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> from the other fats...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Using rats we {{examined}} whether maternal intake of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> rich in {{trans fatty acids}} affects brain fatty acid profile, hypothalamic content of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate- 1 proteins, and the hypophagic effect of centrally administered insulin in 3 -mo-old male progeny. Methods: Throughout pregnancy and lactation, Wistar rats ate isocaloric/normolipidic, diets with soybean oil (control) or soybean oil-derived <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> (trans diet) as a fat source. Upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group). Results: Compared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain - levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. Compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate- 1 levels were significantly lower (44 % and 38 %, respectively) in trans than in control rats. in trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26 % lower (P < 0. 05), whereas insulin receptor substrate- 1 was 50 % lower, than in control rats. Insulin decreased 24 -h feeding in control (27 %) and trans (38 %) rats but {{failed to do so}} in trans-control rats. the latter group had increased-serum glucose levels. Conclusions: the data suggest that the early (intrauterine/perinatal) exposure to <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> rich in trans fatty acids programmed the hypothalamic feeding control mechanisms. As young adults, only trans-control animals showed loss of insulin-induced hypophagia, indicating that the mismatch between early and later nutritional environments was relevant. However, the trans group also, showed signs of altered appetite signaling mechanisms, suggesting that the early adaptations may have deleterious consequences later in life. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
