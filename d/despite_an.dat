However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), <b>despite</b> <b>an</b> earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E
5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, <b>despite</b> <b>an</b> increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers <b>despite</b> <b>an</b> anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery.

5|$|As Canada's {{starting}} goalkeeper at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany, McLeod {{appeared in}} two of three matches in the group stage, allowing six goals. <b>Despite</b> <b>an</b> impressive effort, the Canadian team did not advance past the group stage and finished last. Some have stated that the team was burned out following the extensive residency program {{leading up to the}} World Cup. Players were also critical of the decision of head coach Carolina Morace to hold the camp in Italy as opposed to Canada. Following the tournament, McLeod appeared in two friendlies against the United States and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time <b>despite</b> <b>an</b> early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
