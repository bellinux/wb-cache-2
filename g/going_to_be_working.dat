However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does not really love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> at a summer camp in Shimla. Rahul tells his daughter that she is not allowed to attend the summer camp and heads to a conference, only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him, having left a letter for him. They travel to the camp, with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well, and the two Anjalis meet each other. One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met Rahul's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes a fever, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion. Throughout the days spent at the camp, Rahul and Anjali feel themselves falling in love. Just as they are about to share a heated moment, Anjali thinks about her upcoming engagement and feels guilty. She runs away in tears, after which Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali's fiancee. Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali. She takes this as him rejecting her again, so she leaves the summer camp and decides to get married to Aman as soon as possible.|$|E

Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his esteem in {{the writing}} community, Serling found the series {{difficult}} to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, Mike Wallace asked a question illustrative of the times: [...] "...ou're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> obviously, <b>working</b> so hard on The Twilight Zone that, in essence, {{for the time being}} and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?"

Prospective employees could not be told they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was {{headed in the right direction}} was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E

40|$|California’s {{new economy}} is {{fostering}} far more growth among high- and low-wage jobs compared to middle-income jobs. The {{development of the}} hourglass economy {{means that there is}} a growing number of low-wage workers who cannot support their families even if they work full-time. As a consequence, they must turn to public assistance to meet the basic needs of their families. This study by Carol Zabin, Arindrajit Dube, and Ken Jacobs <b>is</b> the first <b>to</b> quantify how much it costs the public to provide what paychecks don’t. In California, two million working families received public assistance in 2002. The price tag for this assistance was $ 10 billion per year, with most support <b>going</b> <b>to</b> families with full-time workers who earned near the minimum wage. The authors analyzed the ten largest means-tested public assistance programs that Californians participate in: Medi-Cal, the Earned Income Tax Credit, CalWORKs, Food Stamps, Free or Reduced Price Lunch, Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program, Low Income Heat and Energy Assistance, Healthy Families, and Section 8 Rental Assistance. They matched 2002 administrative data from the programs with 2002 detailed demographic and employment data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey. They estimated how many program participants <b>are</b> in <b>working</b> families and the savings that could accrue if workers earned higher wages and received benefits. The authors found that half of all means-tested public assistance dollars <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> families who <b>are</b> <b>working</b> and that most workers on public assistance earn wages that <b>are</b> close <b>to</b> the minimum wage. They conclude that full-time employment at low wages does not bring self-sufficiency to these families and that small improvements in wages could move many off public programs, freeing up scarce resources for families currently on waiting lists. If all workers in the state earned a minimum of $ 8 an hour, program costs would be reduced by $ 2. 7 billion. A movement to $ 14 per hour would reduce expenditures by 5. 6 billion dollars. Likewise, if jobs included health benefits, even at current wage levels, $ 2. 1 billion in expenditures could <b>be</b> put <b>to</b> other uses...|$|R

2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars.

Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors who are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with {{a lot of things that}} they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E
