40|$|Just like animals, insects {{also make}} use of {{digestive}} enzymes to obtain their essential amino acids through the digestion of <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> Because the generation of free amino acids is critical for the growth {{and development of the}} insect, the digestive system would be a very interesting target for the development of new (bio) pesticides. A very promising method of blocking the digestive process in the insect gut was found in their host plants. Plant protease inhibitors (PIs) are major components of the natural plant defensive mechanisms. When present in the insect gut, these antimetabolites can block the <b>hydrolyses</b> of <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> which will lead to a state of amino acid deficiency in the insect. Despite being very promising, successful use of this method in crop protection has been hindered by the ability of most insects to adequately respond to the uptake of these inhibitors. These rapid counterdefenses are the result of a long coevolution between insects and their host plants. Although these responses have been described in detail in most insects, the regulation of these adaptive mechanisms is still poorly understood. It has become clear that if we want to target the digestive system of insects in future methods of pest management, we will have to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms driving this physiological process. In this project, we will create a transcriptome profile of the midgut of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), an infamous pest insect, using RNA-Sequencing. This will give a crucial insight in how the digestion and the PI induced responses are regulated. The generated data can eventually lead to the detection of essential components which can be targeted for combating pest insects. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The primary {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was to determine the association between the source of dietary protein intake and the sum of plasma concentration of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) in patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU). A secondary aim of the study was to examine the effect of dietary compliance on plasma concentration of LNAA. Methods: The analysis included combined participant data from two previous studies conducted at the Emory University School of Medicine. Subjects are males (n= 34) and females (n= 43) with PKU ages 4 - 50 years. A Student t-test was used to compare total combined plasma LNAA (excluding tryptophan and phenylalanine) by dietary compliance status (alpha= 0. 05). Correlation statistics were used to determine the association between the ratio of reported intact <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> on plasma levels of LNAA. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the contribution of intact <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> ratio and other variables to plasma LNAA. Results: The median ratio of intact <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> reported was 0. 354 (IQR: 0. 188, 0. 914). Median percent of PHE intake over the PHE intake recommendation was 31. 64 (Interquartile range [IQR]; 7. 44, 104. 98). Plasma concentration of LNAA did not differ significantly between those with plasma PHE levels within the therapeutic range μmol/L (compliant; 611. 7 μmol/L [n= 19]) vs levels above the therapeutic range (non-compliant; 595. 3 μmol/L [n= 47]); p= 0. 613). There was an inverse marginal correlation between the ratio of intact <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> and plasma concentration of LNAA for those who were compliant (r = - 0. 436, r = 0. 1) although the association was not statistically significant (p= 0. 08). No correlation was found for patients who were non-compliant. Regression analysis revealed that plasma concentration of LNAA was not significantly affected by the ratio of intact <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> ratio, age, or gender. Conclusions: Although not statistically significant, a negative trend was observed between plasma LNAA concentration and the intact <b>protein</b> to medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> ratio in patients compliant with the PHE prescription. This suggests that the ratio of intact dietary protein to protein coming from medical food, as reported by patient diet records, may promote increased plasma LNAA levels in the effective treatment of PKU. The majority of the sample (74 %) were non-compliant with diet based on plasma PHE levels. Future studies are needed to determine the consequences of non-compliance by decreased intake of medical <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> or increased intake of intact protein on plasma LNAA concentration and downstream health effects...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{cross-reactivity}} {{and primary}} sensitization and allergy by new food proteins: the goal and contents of this thesis. Allergies to new <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> {{can result from}} cross-reactivity in existing sensitized or allergic individuals and thereby thus immediately manifest themselves in elicitation of allergic reactions upon consumption (elicitation phase). However, allergies to new <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> may also result from de novo sensitization of - and development of new allergies in - susceptible individuals, in this case thus first requiring these individuals to become sensitized (sensitization phase) before subsequent exposure or intake may elicit allergic reactions (elicitation phase). The aim of this thesis was to develop and test a structured approach to assess the cross-reactive and de novo allergenicity of potential new <b>food</b> <b>proteins,</b> and examine the allergenic risks of insects as potential new <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> sources {{as a case study}} for the structured approach, with specific focus on mealworm as one of the candidate insects as new <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> source. There is no substantial history of use of insects in food in Europe. However, in some other regions of the world, consumption of insects is more common. Reports of food allergy to insects are known, mostly from Asia, where insects are {{high on the list of}} causing anaphylactic symptoms. Detailed descriptions and assessment of the relevance with respect to a possible introduction of insects as a new <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> source in Europe were not available prior to the start of our study. In Chapter 2, the background and proposed structured approach for allergenicity assessment of new <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> and protein sources is presented and studies on mealworm and other insects are presented and discussed in the following chapters. Both in cross-reactive allergy, such as apple allergy in pollen-related-food allergy, and primary allergy, such as generally is the case for peanut, changes in allergenicity caused by heating have been described. Different forms of processing therefore need to be considered in allergenicity assessment. In Chapter 3, this is illustrated for the case for mealworm. Chapters 4 and 5 address risks of cross-reactivity of mealworm proteins in patients with allergies to phylogenetically related allergenic sources (shrimp and house dust mite) and risks of sensitization in patients with unrelated allergies. Primary sensitization and allergy caused by mealworm exposure is described in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7 it is addressed whether and to what extend risks identified for mealworm may also apply to other insects that may candidate as new <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> source, with emphasis on two identified at-risk populations: shrimp and primary mealworm allergic individuals. The results of this thesis are summarized and discussed in the final chapter, in light of the risks of insect proteins for different risk groups in the general population...|$|R

40|$|Nobel Laureate Charles Richet {{demonstrated}} over {{a hundred}} years ago that injecting a protein into animals or humans causes immune system sensitization to that protein. Subsequent exposure to the protein can result in allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. This fact has since been demonstrated {{over and over again in}} humans and animal models. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) confirmed that <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> in vaccines cause food allergy, in its 2011 report on vaccine adverse events. The IOM’s confirmation is the latest and most authoritative since Dr. Richet’s discovery. Many vaccines and injections contain <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> Many studies since 1940 have demonstrated that <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> in vaccines cause sensitization in humans. Allergens in vaccines are not fully disclosed. No safe dosage level for injected allergens has been established. As a result, allergen quantities in vaccines and injections are not regulated. Allergen quantities in vaccine excipients are also not regulated. It has been demonstrated that a smaller quantity of allergen is needed to cause sensitization than elicitation. It is well recognized that many currently approved vaccines have enough allergen to cause anaphylaxis. Therefore, they contain more than enough allergen to cause sensitization. Children today have fewer childhood infectious diseases. They have less exposure to helminths. C-section birth rates have increased in the last few decades by 50 %. C-section births are known to result in sub-optimal gut micro biome in the newborn. All the above result in an immune imbalance biased towards atopy. Vaccine schedules today include 30 - 40 shots. Up to five shots may be simultaneously administered in one sitting. Vaccines contain adjuvants such as pertussis toxins and aluminum compounds that also bias towards allergy. Adjuvants also increase the immunogenicity of injected <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> This combination of atopic children and <b>food</b> <b>protein</b> injection along with adjuvants, contributes to millions developing lifethreatening food allergies. Given the scale and severity of the food allergy epidemic, urgent action is needed to change vaccine policy concerning vaccine specifications, manufacture, vaccine package insert documentation requirements, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the National Vaccine Injury compensation program. Many researchers have called for the removal of <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> from vaccines and re-evaluation of adjuvants such as aluminum compounds. In the interim, food allergy warnings can be included in vaccine package inserts.

40|$|Food allergy {{can present}} as {{immediate}} hypersensitivity [manifestations mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig) E], delayed-type hypersensitivity (reactions associated with specific T lymphocytes), and inflammatory reactions caused by immune complexes. For reasons {{of ethics and}} efficacy, investigations in humans to determine sensitization and allergic responses of IgE production to innocuous <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> are not feasible. Therefore, animal models are used a) to bypass the innate tendency to develop tolerance to <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> and induce specific IgE antibody of sufficient avidity/affinity to cause sensitization and upon reexposure to induce an allergic response, b) to predict allergenicity of novel proteins using characteristics of known food allergens, and c) to treat food allergy by using immunotherapeutic strategies to alleviate life-threatening reactions.

The main concern of acquiring the FFA from the food waste is the challenge which lies during its extraction due to high water content. Prior to the pre-treatment of food waste via the natural biological cycle, the selection of best FFA extraction method was performed on the fresh food waste. It was found that the use of Reflux method is more effective compared to the Soxhlet method. Both extraction methods used two solvents, dichloromethane and n-hexane. Despite of using the different solvent, similar profile FFA and amount have been observed during both extractions. The effectiveness of choosing Reflux method is because it does not require the drying process, when compared to Soxhlet. The following experimentation was carried out to extract the FFA on the <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>food</b> waste during its liquefaction process. This experiment used two types of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>food</b> waste, natural liquefaction and enhanced liquefaction process, with and without introduction of seed sludge, respectively. Both liquefaction processes had undergone beyond the hydrolysis stage, which has included the acidification stage. Results have shown that the natural liquefaction of food waste had provided higher yield of FFA, specifically in 72 hours liquefaction stage. In a different experiment, major FFA profiles which were obtained during the natural 72 hours of liquefaction process was transesterification and found to produced highly unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) ranging from C 16 to C 18. Nevertheless when the transesterification of such FFA using C 2 -C 5 modelled compound, the process had produced the opposite profiling of FAME, which mainly saturated.
