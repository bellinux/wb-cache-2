2500|$|The {{conditions}} made {{it impossible}} to place a line through the town of Horten, forcing the Norwegian National Rail Administration to consider three routes which entirely bypassed the town. Three proposals were made. The two eastern most, denoted Bakkenteigen and Skoppum East, would largely be carried on a large viaduct over the landscape. The third, Skuppum West, would run entirely west of the existing track and pass west of the village of Skoppum. Either way the new station will need a <b>feeder</b> <b>bus</b> <b>service</b> as well as be built with significant park and ride facilities.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} design and {{operational}} problems have been identified. Despite having an 'exclusive' bus lane, unauthorised vehicles illegally using the lanes {{in an attempt to}} more quickly navigate through the traffic jams are a common problem. Depot maintenance shops and special gas stations (most buses use compressed natural gas (CNG)) often have long lines of buses, restricting the availability of buses for service. The CNG powered buses also have suffered from higher fuel consumption than expected (1 litre for 1.3km vs. 2.1km as specified) and high oil and moisture content requiring extra maintenance. Other problems identified were: a lack of feeder bus services, a lack of adequate transfer information and transfer facilities and a lack of articulated buses. [...] A 2010 survey showed 75% of passengers transferred from medium or micro buses to the TransJarkara buses and it was estimated if 'direct service' operations were implemented (i.e., multiple stopping points at some stations with bypass lanes and some services continuing beyond the trunk corridors) patronage would increase by 50%. [...] A <b>feeder</b> <b>bus</b> <b>service</b> called APTB was introduced in 2012.|$|E
