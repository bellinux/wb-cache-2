Coincidence of sensitivity to drought, increasing occurrence of defoliation, and elevated pollutant deposition has produced speculation that northern hardwood forests may be susceptible to the increased climatic stresses projected for the Great Lakes region. The objective of our {{study was to examine}} relationships among environmental stress factors, vigor, mortality, and growth in northern hardwood forests located along a pollution-climate gradient in the Great Lakes region. Between 1987 and 1993, we quantified climatic variables, pollutant deposition, insect defoliation, and tree vigor and growth at five sites along this gradient.

Taxodium is an allochthonous species in Europe and this paper presents the data on the success of its introduction and adaptability to site conditions. Material and methods: For the analysis of the climate characteristics in Bačka Palanka have been used the data of the Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia for the period 1981 - 2010 regarding meteorological station Rimski Šančevi. Dendrometric analysis was performed on the dominant trees of Taxodium by taking an increment core at breast height using Pressler drill.
