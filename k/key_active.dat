50|$|The {{transistor}} is the <b>key</b> <b>active</b> {{component in}} practically all modern electronics. Many consider {{it to be}} one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.

50|$|The {{central core}} region of APH(3’) {{has a high}} degree of {{conformational}} similarity to regions of serine/tyrosine and threonine protein kinases, functionally equivalent enzymes found in eukaryotes. Additionally, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis of <b>key</b> <b>active</b> site residues supports claims that APH(3’) and eukaryotic protein kinases are related, despite sharing less than 10% of total residue content. Several studies have suggested that serine/tyrosine/threonine protein kinases, once thought to only occur in eukaryotes, are also found in the prokaryotes.Additionally, it has been found that aminoglycoside biosynthesis requires phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups during certain steps of synthesis. Thus, it has been speculated that APH(3’) and other protein kinases originate from enzymes from the metabolic pathway for aminoglycosides, and developed in order to counteract the toxic effects of these antibiotics in the host bacterial cell.|$|E
50|$|Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) {{deficiency}} is {{an inherited}} metabolic disorder in humans. Affected patients show multiple disease phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance, and hepatopathy, reflecting {{the central role}} of the enzyme in glucose metabolism. The biochemical phenotypes of the PGM1 mutants cluster into two groups: those with compromised catalysis and those with possible folding defects. Relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, certain missense mutants show greatly decreased expression of soluble protein and/or increased aggregation. In contrast, other missense variants are well behaved in solution, but show dramatic reductions in enzyme activity, with Kcat/Km often <1.5% of wild-type. Modest changes in protein conformation and flexibility are also apparent in some of the catalytically impaired variants. In the case of the G291R mutant, severely compromised activity is linked to the inability of a <b>key</b> <b>active</b> site serine to be phosphorylated, a prerequisite for catalysis. Our results complement previous in vivo studies, which suggest that both protein misfolding and catalytic impairment {{may play a role in}} PGM1 deficiency.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the formation of}} lamellipodia and filopodia, intracellular concentration and cross-talk between different Rho proteins drives the extensions and contractions that cause cellular locomotion. Sakumura et al. proposed a model based on differential equations that helps explain the activity of Rho proteins and their relationship to motion. This model encompassed the three proteins Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac. Cdc42 was assumed to encourage filopodia elongation and block actin depolymerization. RhoA was considered to encourage actin retraction. Rac was treated to encourage lamellipodia extension but block actin depolymerization. These three proteins, although significantly simplified, covered the key steps in cellular locomotion. Through various mathematical techniques, solutions to the differential equations that described various regions of activity based on intracellular activity were found. The paper concludes by showing that the model predicts that there are a few threshold concentrations that cause interesting effects on the activity of the cell. Below a certain concentration, there is very little activity, causing no extension of the arms and feet of the cell. Above a certain concentration, the Rho protein causes a sinusoidal oscillation much like the extensions and contractions of the lamellipodia and filopodia. In essence, this model predicts that increasing the intracellular concentration of these three <b>key</b> <b>active</b> Rho proteins causes an out-of-phase activity of the cell, resulting in extensions and contractions that are also out of phase.|$|E

40|$|The key {{metabolic}} enzyme phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM 1) controls {{glucose homeostasis}} in most human cells. Four proteins related to PGM 1, known as PGM 2, PGM 2 L 1, PGM 3 and PGM 5, {{and referred to}} herein as paralogs, are encoded in the human genome. Although {{all members of the}} same enzyme superfamily, these proteins have distinct substrate preferences and different functional roles. The recent association of PGM 1 and PGM 3 with inherited enzyme deficiencies prompts us to revisit sequence-structure and other relationships among the PGM 1 paralogs, which are understudied despite their importance in human biology. Using currently available sequence, structure, and expression data, we investigated evolutionary relationships, tissue-specific expression profiles, and the amino acid preferences of <b>key</b> <b>active</b> site motifs. Phylogenetic analyses indicate both ancient and more recent divergence between the different enzyme sub-groups comprising the human paralogs. Tissue-specific protein and RNA expression profiles show widely varying patterns for each paralog, providing insight into function and disease pathology. Multiple sequence alignments confirm high conservation of <b>key</b> <b>active</b> site regions, but also reveal differences related to substrate specificity. In addition, we find that sequence variants of PGM 2, PGM 2 L 1, and PGM 5 verified in the human population affect residues associated with disease-related mutants in PGM 1 or PGM 3. This suggests that inherited diseases related to dysfunction of these paralogs will likely occur in humans...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine <b>key</b> {{components}} of <b>active</b> learning. I hypothesized that feedback, accountability, and guided exploration were <b>key</b> components of <b>active</b> learning. I collected survey data from second year medical students (N = 103) in three different active learning interventions: peer instruction (PI), team-based learning (TBL), and problem-based learning (PBL), at six time points. My results did not consistently support my hypotheses. However, I observed a pattern of differences concerning feedback and accountability in the predicted direction in all three interventions. Feedback had a positive effect on professionalism in both PI and PBL, and accountability had positive effects on emotion control and professionalism in both PI and TBL. Also, I found results that raised issues related to each key component. Namely, that perceptions of feedback were influenced by the nature of questions, interactions between individuals, and the source of feedback. Furthermore, accountability was influenced by team membership and a proper measure of guided exploration needs to be developed. This study raised questions regarding which components of active learning affect important outcomes, and what issues affect <b>key</b> components of <b>active</b> learning...|$|R
