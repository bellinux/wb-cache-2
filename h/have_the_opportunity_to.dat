In their interactions with peers, children <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> learn about unique conversational roles. Through pragmatic directions, adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words.|$|E

5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for {{children with special needs}} were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the modern industries upon which Gifu's economy rests, the city also has {{a wide array of}} traditional industries, which include traditional Gifu Fans, Mino washi and foods created from the ayu sweetfish. Many shops throughout the city produce these goods. The most well-known local industries, though, are traditional Gifu Lanterns and Umbrellas. There are approximately 15 businesses that make lanterns in the city, the largest of which is the Ozeki Lantern, Co. In the Kanō area, visitors <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> take a course and make their own paper umbrellas.|$|E

5|$|Period 8 is a {{specific}} set of extra-curricular activities which includes a Combined Cadet Force, outdoor pursuits, Scouts, lifesaving and community service. There are five field days in the year, on which these activities especially take place. Before the third form, pupils <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> decide between the CCF, outdoor pursuits and the scouts. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme is 'Hors Combat' for choice, being available to all students, regardless of their other options, so no longer officially constitutes part of period 8.|$|E

She loaned her paintings to the Worcester Art Museum, and the Fitchburg Public Library was a beneficiary of photographs, prints, engravings, textiles, dishes, and furniture.

5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was unfavorable to criminal defendants, {{he took the}} side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis {{is not enough to}} prove a substance was a drug.|$|E
5|$|Blonde {{remained}} with the 4th Battle Squadron through 1916, {{although she was}} detached for several months mid year. She had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron by April 1917 and was converted into a minelayer later in the year, although she never laid any mines in combat. Similarly, Blanche {{remained with}} the 3rd Battle Squadron until January 1916 when she joined her sister in the 4th Battle Squadron. The ship participated in the Battle of Jutland, but was on the unengaged side of the fleet and did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> fire at the Germans. She was detached from the 4th Battle Squadron {{at the beginning of}} 1917, presumably to be converted into a minelayer. Blanche was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron by April and laid some mines {{at the entrance to the}} Kattegat in February 1918.|$|E

She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed he would soon <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{the heir}} of the Yagami clan, who wield pyrokinetic powers and sealed the Orochi demon {{along with the}} Kusanagi and Yata clans. However, after betraying the Kusanagi clan, the Yagami are cursed by Orochi giving them powers that cause all their members to die young. The {{character}} harbors hatred against the other clans, but later becomes obsessed with killing their heir Kyo. As a result, Iori sometimes helps him in order to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> have a final fight against him. Aside from the main series, Iori appears in several other media series such as spin-offs and crossover video games, and comic adaptations of the series.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
