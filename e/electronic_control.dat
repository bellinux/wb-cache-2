5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E

5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process.|$|E
