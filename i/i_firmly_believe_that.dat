A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. [...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: [...] "I feel a sense of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the latter is in every respect a superior work." ...|$|E
500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1932, Copeland {{made her}} maiden speech on import duties, which she {{approached}} [...] "entirely {{from the point}} of view of the pottery industry". It was an industry under threat from foreign competition and she welcomed the protection that tariffs afforded. She believed that overseas manufacturers paid starvation wages to their workers, and it was with a critical eye on the opposition benches that she asked:"Can we allow goods manufactured under those conditions to come into this country and lower the standard of living of our own people? I say 'no', and <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> if we raise these tariffs, the time will come when our industry will be on its feet again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gail Dines, {{writing in}} Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality, {{describes}} the money {{shot of a}} man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as [...] "one of the most degrading acts in porn". To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body [...] "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, [...] "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have." [...] She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1909, The Washington Post {{published}} Cochems {{comments on}} the game under the headline, [...] "FOOTBALL LIKE AN AIRSHIP WOULD OPEN UP THE GAME." [...] Cochems advocated the redesign of the football to render it more aerodynamic and easy to handle:"The story in a nutshell is this. [...] The ball is too large and too light. Some of the best teams in the country find it impossible to use the pass owing to lack of players who can make it. ... Since {{it is impossible to}} grow larger hands and it is possible to make the ball conform to human dimensions, why not make the ball fit the needed conditions? ... With a ball such as I have proposed, longer, narrower, and a bit heavier, so that it would carry {{in the face of a}} strong wind, <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the game of rugby would develop [...] into one of the most beautiful and versatile sports the world ever saw." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{reaction was}} somewhat different. The news {{coincided with the}} end of the NFU conference where NFU president Peter Kendall, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice and food critic Jay Rayner were among those defending the concept of large scale farming. The news was greeted with concern that the dairy industry would find it hard to meet future challenges if it could not evolve and develop. [...] Mansel Raymond, chair of the NFU's dairy board, said: [...] "It is disappointing that the application has been withdrawn. Any planned investment in the dairy industry is a positive step. Nocton was an imaginative and innovative proposal, and <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there remains a place in Britain for this type of investment if we are to meet the growing demand for food.” The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers also expressed its disappointment at the withdrawal. The British Cattle Veterinary Association, which leads the industry in managing the health and welfare of dairy cows in the UK, also took the steps of dismissing claims that Nocton Dairies would have been a [...] "cow prison", saying its developers demonstrated a commitment to good welfare.|$|E

The blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived.|$|R

60|$|I {{became aware}} that, save for two men {{leaning over the}} {{stricken}} one, the room was empty; and all the tides of intense fear, hitherto held back by intenser curiosity, swept over my soul. I ardently desired the outside air. It was possible that the Chinamen would mistake me for the Mexican,--everything horrible seemed possible just then,--and {{it was more than}} possible that the stairways would be closed while they were hunting for the murderer. The man on the floor coughed a sickening cough. I heard it as I fled, and one of his companions turned out the lamp. Those stairs seemed interminable, and to add to my dismay there was no sound of commotion in the house. No one hindered, no one even looked at me. There was no trace of the Mexican. I found the doorway and, my legs trembling under me, reached the protection of the clear cool night, the fog, and the rain. I dared not run, and {{for the life of me}} I could not walk. I must have effected a compromise, for I remember the light of a street lamp showed the shadow of one half skipping--caracoling along the pavements in what seemed to be an ecstacy of suppressed happiness. But it was fear--deadly fear. Fear compounded of past knowledge of the Oriental--only other white man--available witness--three stories underground--and the cough of the Chinaman now some forty feet under my clattering boot-heels. It was good to see the shop-fronts and electric lights again. Not for anything would I have informed the police, because <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Mexican had been dealt with somewhere down there on the third floor long ere I had reached the air; and, moreover, once clear of the place, I could not for the life of me tell where it was. My ill-considered flight brought me out somewhere a mile distant from the hotel; and the clank of the lift that bore me to a bed six stories above ground was music in my ears. Wherefore I would impress it upon you who follow after, do not knock about the Chinese quarters at night and alone. You may stumble across a picturesque piece of human nature that will unsteady your nerves for half a day.|$|R
