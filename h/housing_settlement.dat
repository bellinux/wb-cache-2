The government of Balikpapan city has done some settlements planning. The initial goal is to move illegal settlement communities occupying the land in the buffer zone of Pertamina. The research uses exploratory and explanatory deductive quantitative approach and qualitative methods. The analysis used are: 1) The provision of environmental infrastructure as a form of basic settlement infrastructure provision; 2) The change of the community condition and environment; 3) The form of community participation upon the relocation program at floating <b>house</b> <b>settlement</b> The accomplishment achieved in the relocation program of floating <b>house</b> <b>settlement</b> is well-prepared buildings physical condition and good environment at the settlement, so that there is no new slums in the current neighborhood.

50|$|The {{area has}} been {{completely}} remodeled {{and covered with a}} layer of topsoil, in order to recover the ancient morphology and create new hills and wooded habitats. They were planted about 1500 trees including 562 oaks, Quercus pubescens 566, 196 maples, willows 96, 65 Quercus fastigiata, about 280 oak trees to cespuglioni and several species of shrubs such as gorse, privet, myrtle, and cysts, selected to rebuild in a natural environment quickly. To facilitate the complete re-naturalization of the places were implanted whole clods of complete vegetation topsoil (ecocelle), taken from the nearby estate of Castel di Guido. Two kilometers of trails, bordered by rows of trees and equipped with a fitness trail, through the woods. The green area, with a children's play, whose main attraction is a fun cable car suitable for both children and adults, is equipped with tables and wooden benches. The park has an important function for the <b>housing</b> <b>settlement,</b> because it improves the livability and environmental quality of the entire territory, characterized by the presence of industrial plants and a high concentration of mining activities.|$|E
50|$|The post-war {{reconstruction}} process heralded {{an era of}} rapid population growth in Queensland, leading to an acute shortage in housing. Temporary housing became a necessity. The Queensland State Housing Commission made use of the military facilities in Victoria Park; it became the second largest temporary <b>housing</b> <b>settlement</b> in Brisbane. Each hut would house several families. By 1950 Victoria Park was the impermanent home for 460 families (usually for not more than three years). It is believed that up to 100,000 Queenslanders lived in temporary housing between 1946 and 1960; this demonstrates {{the importance of this}} period in Victoria Park's history, as well as to Queensland's social history. The temporary housing camps in Victoria Park were closed in 1960. The University of Queensland purchased several of the fibrolite military buildings immediately after the war. These were then used by the School of Medicine to house the anatomy and physiotherapy departments prior to their permanent move to St. Lucia in 1961 and 1972. The Queensland Institute of Medical Research also purchased a military building. These buildings were all vacated by 1977, and subsequently demolished.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, at the National {{conference of}} social work in Buffalo, the Association {{of the study of}} {{community}} organization (ASCO) was organized. The main objective was to improve the professional practice of organization for social welfare. In 1955, ASCO merged with six other professional organisations to form the National Association {{of social work}}ers. Settlement movement in USA, the social settlements which are most often referred to as “settlement houses” are historically significant examples of community organizations, participating in both organizing and development at the neighborhood level. Settlement houses were commonly located in the industrial cities of the East and Midwest during the beginning of the 20th century. They were largely established in working-class neighborhoods by the college educated children of middle class citizens concerned by the substantial social problems that were the results of the increasing industrialization and urbanization of the social settlement movement. History shows that innovative methods of community organizing have risen in response to vast social problems. The social problems at the time of settlement houses included child labor, working class poverty, and <b>housing.</b> <b>Settlement</b> workers thought that by providing education services (English classes) and social services (employment assistance, legal aid, recreational programs, children services) to the poor the income gap between them and the middle class would regress. The majority of funding for services came from charitable resources. The landscape of community organization today, in the US as well as globally, is greatly informed by models and structures of social service administration and funding.|$|E
