Against the rapidly growing German military force, Poland not only possessed no comparable quantity of technical resources, but also lacked the knowledge and concepts of developing modern warfare.|$|E

40|$|Using a novel dataset {{that allows}} us to trace the primary bank {{relationships}} of a sample of mostly unlisted firms, we explore which borrowers are able to benefit from foreign bank presence in emerging markets. Our results suggest that the limits to financial integration are less tight than the static picture of bank-firm relationships implies. Even though foreign banks are more likely to engage large and foreign-owned firms, they do not terminate relationships with the clients of banks they acquire as often as domestic financial acquirers do. Most importantly, firms appear to have the same access to <b>financial</b> <b>loans</b> and ability to invest whether they borrow from a foreign bank or not. Since firms without bank relationships make lower use of <b>financial</b> <b>loans,</b> and invest less, our results suggest that by making relationships more stable and by indirectly enhancing access to the financial system, foreign banks may benefit all firms. competition; emerging markets; foreign bank lending; lending relationships...|$|R

Later Newton personally rebuilt Cressbrook Mill after its destruction by fire. Archives at Manchester Central Library contain evidence that he sought to provide better living conditions for his apprentices than were prevalent at many other mills, and he oversaw the construction of model cottages and a village school. However, an apprenticeship even at Cressbrook Mill was far from ideal.

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-80), Ali Ahmad Jalali cites sources saying that the regular army was about 50,000 strong and consisted of 62 infantry and 16 cavalry regiments, with 324 guns mostly organized in horse and mountain artillery batteries. Sedra cites Jalali, who writes that '..although Amir Shir Ali Khan (1863-78) is widely credited for founding the modern Afghan Army, it was only under Abdur Rahman that it became a viable and effective institution. In 1880 Amir Abdur Rahman Khan established a newly equipped Afghan Army with help from the British. The Library of Congress Country Study for Afghanistan states:"When Rahman Khan came to the throne, the army was virtually nonexistent. With the assistance of a liberal <b>financial</b> <b>loan</b> from the British, plus their aid in the form of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies, he began a 20-year task of creating a respectable regular force by instituting measures that formed the long-term basis of the military system. These included increasing the equalization of military obligation by setting up a system known as the hasht nafari (whereby one man in every eight between the ages of 20 and 40 took his turn at military service); constructing an arsenal in Kabul to reduce dependence on foreign sources for small arms and other ordnance; introducing supervised training courses; organizing troops into divisions, brigades, and regiments, including battalions of artillery; developing pay schedules; and introducing an elementary (and harsh) disciplinary system." ...|$|E

There, Koc met several representatives from the government and some economists in order to prepare the planned visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Józef Beck. Having returned, with Śmigły-Rydz's consent, Koc was trying to convince the government to start talks about a material and a <b>financial</b> <b>loan</b> with the British, which he succeeded to do. On 10 June 1939, Koc received some informal instructions from Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski and was nominated as head of the official loan delegation to London, which parted from Warsaw three days later. Initially, the delegation estimated the needed quote at ₤50-60 mln (approximately 1.24-1.49 bln zł), which was afterwards limited to a more humble ₤24 million (ca. 600 mln zł). The talks were uneasy. The main problem within the Polish delegation was the question of sterling area accession, one of the conditions of the loan submittance. Contrary to Kwiatkowski, Koc likened the idea of such a monetary union. At the end, the Polish delegation did not manage to receive the loan in June 1939 (although talks were to be continued in autumn). The only portion of money they received from Britain before the war broke out was an ₤8 million material loan on 2 August 1939.|$|E

Most importantly, using a propensity score methodology, we show that only in countries where foreign bank presence is limited, firms that (directly) borrow from a foreign bank obtain more <b>financial</b> <b>loans</b> than comparable firms and thus invest more and have higher increases in profitability. In other words, firms seem to benefit from foreign bank presence only if they maintain a direct relationship.
