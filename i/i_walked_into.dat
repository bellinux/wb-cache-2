You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E

500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that year}} he mounted {{a show of}} O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish {{paintings}} on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said [...] "The day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the Photo-Secession 291 [...] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day I walked out of An American Place in 1932 was not less good.

2500|$|Morrison {{concluded}} recording in the summer, when {{he recorded}} {{the rest of}} the songs for the album. Four songs were not used from this session, including the future singles [...] "Real Real Gone" [...] and [...] "Tore Down a la Rimbaud". Neither Knopfler nor Herbie Armstrong were able to produce the guitar tone Morrison wanted, so engineer Jim Stern suggested Chris Michie: [...] "I got the call when I was doing a session in San Francisco.

2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, I felt I could avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory.

2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther.

It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the office and I started work the next day.

[...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!!
