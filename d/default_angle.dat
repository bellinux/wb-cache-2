While you have free {{control of the}} camera, it rarely cooperates with your commands and the <b>default</b> <b>angle</b> shows far {{too much of the}} ground and not enough of the terrain in front of you. When you do try to {{get a good look at}} the environments, the graphics engine slows to a crawl and teeters on the edge of crashing." [...] Satterfield concluded that the game's [...] "erratic jumping controls and annoying camera issues will ensure that even the little ones will become frustrated." ...|$|E
50|$|There are six basic {{types of}} games {{available}} in Air-Sea Battle, {{and for each}} type, there are one or two groups of three games, {{for a total of}} twenty-seven game variants. Within each group, variant one is the standard game, variant two features guided missiles which can be directed left or right after being fired, and variant three pits a single player (using the right gun) against a computer opponent, which simply fires continuously at the <b>default</b> <b>angle</b> or speed. In every game, players shoot targets (enemy planes or ships, shooting gallery targets, or each other, depending on the game chosen) competing to get a higher score. Each round lasts two minutes and sixteen seconds; the player with the higher score after time expires is the winner, unless one player wins (and ends the game) by reaching 99 points before the time is up.|$|E

50|$|Match {{presentation}} {{has also}} been overhauled with a new <b>default</b> camera <b>angle</b> and improvements to the broadcast-style match build-up. Some in-game cutscenes have been removed, such as those before throw-ins and corner kicks. Instead, a player will simply run to perform the task in question with no interruption.|$|R
5000|$|Level {{design was}} {{received}} generally poorly. 1UP.com highlighted repetitive environmental textures {{as contributing to}} the difficulty of finding one's way through the levels, comparing them to textures that might be found in PlayStation games. Smith echoed this opinion, additionally noting occasionally problematic <b>default</b> camera <b>angles.</b> Hopper stated that [...] "most of the environments look very nice and detailed, while some are a little plain." [...] Turner called the environments overall [...] "samey" [...] and [...] "uninspired".|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} three ¢ndings {{concerning the}} mechanisms of depth perception. First, {{the shape of the}} three-dimensional percept evoked by two-frame motion is de¢ned solely by the rotation component around an axis in the frontoparallel plane; the visual system assigns a default value to this rotation component to arrive at a unique solution. Second, when the visual axes of two eyes are almost parallel, the visual system uses a default vergence value to reconstruct stereoscopic depth. Third, the default vergence and <b>default</b> rotation <b>angles</b> are highly correlated across subjects. This correlation implies that the two modalities share a common scaling default at an internal level...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to find the optimum tilt angle of solar PV panel at which the yearly demand would be met maximum. Solar PV is one of the most widely used {{renewable}} energy resources. The output of a panel is highest when the incident ray is perpendicular to the panel plane. Due to variations in the locus of the sun over the year, the alignment of the panel should be changed according to the sun position for maximum generation. However, changing the tilt angle needs single axis tracker or double axes tracker which is costly and also needs maintenance; thus may not be suitable. Therefore, the panel is kept at the average tilt of year at which the ray is perpendicular for the maximum time. This may be termed as the <b>default</b> tilt <b>angle.</b> The generation of solar panel varies over the year providing maximum generation at the <b>default</b> tilt <b>angle.</b> Similarly, the consumption of an area is also varies over the year. The amount of generation may not proportional as the demand, thus it results surplus or shortage. For an isolated area, it is hardly possible to use surplus energy considering certain demand profile. Even, it is not possible to store the surplus energy of a season to any device for long time to use it for another season. However, the surplus energy of a season may be shifted to the shortage season by changing the tilt angle. Different tilt angle will provide different pattern of generation over the year. The generation at optimum tilt angle will not maximize the generation of energy over the year rather it will maximize the demand met by shifting the energy to shortage season from surplus season. A new concept to maximize the energy usage from solar PV by changing the tilt angle and thus minimize the shortage to meet the demand of an isolated power system is also introduced here...|$|R
40|$|Dreismann, Gray and Blach (DGB) {{have claimed}} that neutron {{scattering}} from molecular hydrogen at energy transfers E sufficiently large to break the H-H bond, gives E ∼ 3 % larger than predicted by conventional quantum theory. DGB presented this claim as the first experimental evidence for energetic consequences of decoherence of quantum entangled particles due to interactions with the environment. It is shown here this claim is entirely spurious. DGB obtained disagreement with conventional theory by changing the geometrical description of the Vesuvio instrument at ISIS, they used to collect their data. Instead of using the <b>default</b> scattering <b>angles</b> obtained from neutron diffraction, DGB used scattering angles obtained using a steel rule and protractor. DGB then manufactured apparent but in fact completely spurious evidence for quantum decoherence effects from the large measurement errors in the scattering angles they used. These give shifts to both higher and lower E than predicted by conventional quantum theory. DGB simply ignored detectors giving shifts to lower values of E. DGB also ignored previously published H 2 data that clearly contradict their claim...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the work proposed herein is to optimize the flip angle in gradient-echo based PC-MRI methods for decreased measurement variability in quantitative blood velocity measurements of the common femoral arteries. Background PC-MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique {{used to measure the}} velocity of flowing blood in a particular blood vessel with flexible spatial and temporal resolution [1, 2]. It is considered the clinical “gold standard ” for quantification of blood flow. PC-MRI boasts a variety of established applications in quantifying cardiovascular function and hemodynamics. In particular, this technique offers clinicians with a means of measuring peak velocity, mean velocity, flow rate, and total flow throughout the vasculature of the human body. One of the challenges in PC-MRI is the wide range of variables that make up a given protocol requiring careful optimization of each imaging parameter in an effort to accomplish the goals of a given scan. Surprisingly, the current PC-MRI utilizes a <b>default</b> flip <b>angle,</b> which has not been optimized. A theoretical description of the signal acquired from flowing spins in spoiled gradient-echo pulse sequences has been previously developed [3]. These efforts indicate that there exists a flip angle that provides an optimized SNR for a given tissue, echo time, repetition time, slice thickness and velocity, which leads to increased reproducibility of quantitative PC-MRI measurements. This optimization cannot be performed empirically {{because of the number of}} parameters involved, hence mathematical and computation work is required...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{intuitive}} motion editing technique allowing the end-user to transform an original motion by applying position constraints on freely selected {{locations of the}} character body. The major innovation comes from the possibility to assign a priority level to each constraint. The resulting scale of user-defined priority levels allows to handle multiple asynchronously overlapping constraints. As a consequence the end user can enforce a larger range of natural behaviors where conflicting constraints compete to control {{a common set of}} joints. By <b>default</b> the joint <b>angles</b> of the original motion are preserved as the lowest priority constraint. However, in case a Cartesian constraint from the original motion is essential, it is straightforward to define a high priority constraint that will retain it before enforcing other lower priority constraints. Additional features are proposed to provide a more productive motion editing process like defining the constraints relative to a mobile frame and precisely specifying which joints are recruited by each constrain. The current limitation remains its computing cost which will be improved in future work...|$|R
40|$|Vision is {{important}} for postural control as is shown by the Romberg quotient (RQ) : with eyes closed, postural instability increases relative to eyes open (RQ =  2). Yet while fixating at far distance, postural stability is similar with eyes open and eyes closed (RQ =  1). Postural stability can be better with both eyes viewing than one eye, but such effect is not consistent among healthy subjects. The first goal {{of the study is}} to test the RQ as a function of distance for children with convergent versus divergent strabismus. The second goal is to test whether vision from two eyes relative to vision from one eye provides better postural stability. Thirteen children with divergent strabismus and eleven with convergent strabismus participated in this study. Posturtography was done with the Techno concept device. Experiment 1, four conditions: fixation at 40 cm and at 200 cm both with eyes open and eyes covered (evaluation of RQ). Experiment 2, six conditions: fixation at 40 cm and at 200 cm, with both eyes viewing or under monocular vision (dominant and non-dominant eye). For convergent strabismus, the groups mean value of RQ was 1. 3 at near and 0. 94 at far distance; for divergent, it was 1. 06 at near and 1. 68 at far. For all children, the surface of body sway was significantly smaller under both eyes viewing than monocular viewing (either eye). Increased RQ value at near for convergent and at far for divergent strabismus is attributed to the influence of the <b>default</b> strabismus <b>angle</b> and to better use of ocular motor signals. Vision with the two eyes improves postural control for both viewing distances and for both types of strabismus. Such benefit can be due to complementary mechanisms: larger visual field, better quality of fixation and vergence angle due to the use of visual inputs from both eyes...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method of dynamic C-D gain {{adaptation}} that improves target acquisition for users with motor impairments. Our method, called the Angle Mouse, adjusts the mouse C-D gain {{based on the}} deviation of angles sampled during movement. When angular deviation is low, the gain is kept high. When angular deviation is high, the gain is dropped, making the target bigger in motor-space. A key feature of the Angle Mouse is that, unlike most pointing facilitation techniques, it is target-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of target locations or dimensions. This means {{that the problem of}} distractor targets is avoided because adaptation is based solely on the user’s behavior. In a study of 16 people, 8 of which had motor impairments, we found that the Angle Mouse improved motor-impaired pointing throughput by 10. 3 % over the Windows default mouse and 11. 0 % over sticky icons. For able-bodied users, {{there was no significant difference}} among the three techniques, as Angle Mouse throughput was within 1. 2 % of the <b>default.</b> Thus, the <b>Angle</b> Mouse improved pointing performance for users with motor impairments while remaining unobtrusive for able-bodied users.
