5|$|Mutinus <b>elegans</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by British missionary John Banister in 1679 who chronicled {{the natural history}} of Virginia; this early report is thought to be the first account of a fungus in North America. It was first characterized scientifically by French scientist Jean Pierre François Camille Montagne in 1856, who called it Corynites <b>elegans.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called microRNAs, {{were found to have}} a role in the {{development}} of C. <b>elegans.</b>|$|E
5|$|C. <b>elegans</b> is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate, and lacks a {{respiratory}} and a circulatory system. It possesses gut granules which emit {{a brilliant}} blue fluorescence, {{a wave of}} which is seen at death in a 'death fluorescence'.|$|E
5|$|Homologs of BRCA2 {{are also}} {{essential}} for meiosis in the fungus Ustilago maydis, the worm Caenorhabditis <b>elegans,</b> and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 32 {{basidiomycete}} mushrooms showed that Mutinus <b>elegans</b> {{was the only}} species to show antibiotic (both antibacterial and antifungal) activity against all six microorganisms tested, namely, the human pathogenic bacteris Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, he instructed that she be shown on a Venus <b>elegans</b> shell.|$|E
5|$|Chromosome numbers include 2n=14, 22, 26, with {{numerous}} aneuploid and polyploid derivatives. The basic chromosome number is 7, {{with the exception}} of N. tazetta, N. <b>elegans</b> and N. broussonetii in which it is 10 or 11; this subgenus (Hermione) was in fact characterised by this characteristic. Polyploid species include N. papyraceus (4x=22) and N. dubius (6x=50).|$|E
5|$|Clinical {{trials and}} studies in animal models (including C. <b>elegans)</b> suggest that {{ketogenic}} diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits {{for a number}} of adult neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2012, there is limited clinical trial data in these areas, and, outside of paediatric epilepsy, use of the ketogenic diet remains at the research stage.|$|E
5|$|Exogenous dsRNA is {{detected}} and bound by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in C. <b>elegans</b> and R2D2 in Drosophila, that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown. This RNA-binding protein then facilitates {{the transfer of}} cleaved siRNAs to the RISC complex.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{species that}} have been {{identified}} as having lived in Lake Cahuilla include Cyprinodon macularius, Elops affinis, Gila <b>elegans,</b> Gila cypha, Gila robusta, Mugil cephalus, Ptychocheilus lucius, and Xyrauchen texanus. Lake Cahuilla featured similar fish species as the lower Colorado River.|$|E
5|$|In C. <b>elegans</b> this {{initiation}} {{response is}} amplified through {{the synthesis of}} a population of 'secondary' siRNAs during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' siRNAs are used as templates. These 'secondary' siRNAs are structurally distinct from dicer-produced siRNAs and appear to be produced by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).|$|E
5|$|The birds {{most often}} {{mentioned}} {{in relation to}} North Island are the Abrolhos painted buttonquail (Turnix varius scintillans), a rare subspecies of the widespread painted buttonquail (Turnix varius) known only from the Wallabi Group and protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950; and the brush bronzewing (Phaps <b>elegans),</b> {{one of the most}} common birds on North Island, the mainland populations of which are decreasing.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus, which {{lives in}} the oviducts of birds, has been recorded in the corn crake, as have the parasitic worm Plagiorchis <b>elegans,</b> the larvae of parasitic flies, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis <b>elegans,</b> the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. <b>elegans,</b> as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis <b>elegans,</b> a nematode worm. In the case of C. <b>elegans,</b> the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|Mutinus <b>elegans</b> is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down dead or dying organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and in wood chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the parasitic worm Plagiorchis <b>elegans,</b> the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|The Human Genome Project—the largest, {{most costly}} single {{biological}} study ever undertaken—began in 1988 {{under the leadership}} of James D. Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. <b>elegans.</b> Shotgun sequencing and gene discovery methods pioneered by Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. <b>elegans</b> contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term <b>elegans</b> 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and the consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E
5|$|The species, {{originally}} named Agaricus marginatus by the Danish naturalist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher in 1803, {{has several}} synonyms. Elias Magnus Fries renamed it Agaricus aurantio-marginatus in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum, while Christiaan Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus schumacheri in 1828. Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date, Fries's name is sanctioned, {{and so the}} specific epithet he used is given nomenclatural precedence. French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to the genus Mycena in 1872. In 1930 Karel Cejp considered {{it to be a}} variety of Mycena <b>elegans.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus <b>elegans,</b> have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation {{at one end of}} the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. <b>elegans.</b> In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. <b>elegans</b> to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus <b>elegans),</b> though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E
5|$|The type of RNA editing {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. <b>elegans</b> strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E
25|$|Xanthoria <b>elegans</b> was {{described}} by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link as Lichen <b>elegans</b> in 1791, and transferred to the genus Xanthoria by Theodor Magnus Fries (son of Elias Magnus Fries) in 1860.|$|E
25|$|Ipomopsis <b>elegans,</b> Bot. Reg. t. 1281.|$|E
25|$|OpenWorm, {{project to}} {{simulate}} the roundworm Caenorhabditis <b>elegans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{functionally}} specialized for nociception {{have been}} documented in other invertebrates including the leech Hirudo medicinalis, the nematode Caenorhabditis <b>elegans</b> and the molluscs Aplysia californica and Cepaea nemoralis. Changes in neuronal activity induced by noxious stimuli have been recorded in the nervous centres of Caenorhabditis <b>elegans,</b> Drosophila melanogaster and larval Manduca sexta.|$|E
25|$|Polyscias maraisiana {{has been}} the subject of some {{nomenclatural}} instability. In 1984, Wessel Marais separated it from Gastonia cutispongia as Gastonia mauritiana. In 2003, it was shown that the correct name for this species was Gastonia <b>elegans</b> because it had first been described in 1866 as Terminalia <b>elegans.</b> This description was a large and unexpected taxonomic error because Terminalia is in the Myrtalean family Combretaceae. In 2010, when this species was transferred to Polyscias, the specific epithet had to be changed again because the names Polyscias mauritiana and Polyscias <b>elegans</b> already existed. The latter two are in the Polyscias subgenera Grotefendia and Tieghemopanax, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The fungus Cunninghamella <b>elegans</b> is {{also able}} to degrade {{synthetic}} phenolic compounds like bisphenol A.|$|E
25|$|Cunninghamella <b>elegans</b> is a {{candidate}} for use as a model for mammalian drug metabolism.|$|E
25|$|C. <b>elegans,</b> Drosophila {{and human}} cells. Yet no simple linear route can {{describe}} the data obtained so far.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} {{used the}} microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis <b>elegans</b> as a host and the pathogenic bacteria Serratia marcescens {{to generate a}} host-parasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen Hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the mating system of C. <b>elegans,</b> causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the S. marcescens parasite. It {{was found that the}} self-fertilizing populations of C. <b>elegans</b> were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis.|$|E
