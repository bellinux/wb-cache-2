Wallops {{also supports}} development tests and exercises involving United States Navy aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon {{systems in the}} Virginia Capes operating area, {{near the entrance to}} the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile radar, telemetry receivers, and <b>command</b> <b>transmitters</b> that can be transported by cargo planes to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.|$|R
5000|$|Laurentic was {{launched}} in 1908 and departed on her maiden voyage 29 April 1909, from Liverpool to Quebec City, with 1,057 passengers on board. She normally served on the Liverpool-Canada route, and also stopped in New York during the winter months. While crossing the Atlantic to New York on 22 January 1910, she {{was caught in a}} powerful storm; waves destroyed the windows of the upper deck and flooded the navigation bridge and the officers quarters, disabling the service <b>command</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The ship survived, and arrived safely to port. The Laurentic gained notoriety later in 1910 during the capture of murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen, in which Chief Inspector Walter Dew of the Metropolitan Police used Laurentics speed to arrive in Canada before the fleeing suspect on [...]|$|R

The firing unit had a J-band monopulse 17 km range single target tracking radar mounted concentrically with the launcher turret, which carried four ready to launch missiles, two on each side. The system also had an I-band 10° antenna beam-width <b>command</b> <b>transmitter,</b> differential angle-error measurement infrared tracking and gathering system with a +-5° wide field of view, an integrated TV tracking mode as a low-elevation back-up, an optical designation tripod-mounted binocular device (which is controlled manually by a handlebar arrangement and used primarily in a heavy ECM environment or whenever passive operation was required), computer, operating console and datalink.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Megamile {{communications}} {{call for}} the fullest use of advanced modern technology. This paper surveys {{the design of a}} deep-space communication system. The basic constraints and capabilities of a low-noise ground receiving system are covered in detail, including antenna temperature contributions from galactic noise, tropospheric and ionospheric attenuation, and earth radiation through antenna side lobes. Low-noise preamplifiers, large high-gain antennas, and narrow-band phase-lock receivers are also considered. Digital biphase modulation, used in Pioneer V, is compared with more sophisticated bi-orthogonal coding systems. Both types of coding systems are compared with error rate as a parameter, with the ideal error-free Shannon limit. The design of Pioneer V and its record of achievement are described. Included are explanations of the coherent transponder within the spacecraft, and of the <b>command</b> <b>transmitter</b> and telemetry reception equipment at the ground stations. 1...|$|R

Mission operators decided to complete the mission imminently, as Suzaku had exceeded its design lifespan by eight years at this point.

40|$|The {{security}} challenges being {{encountered in}} many places require electronic means of controlling access to communities, recreational centres, offices, and homes. The electronically controlled automated security access gate being proposed in this work helps to prevent an unwanted access to controlled environments. This is achieved mainly {{through the use of}} a Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter-receiver pair. In the design a microcontroller is programmed to decode a given sequence of keys that is entered on a keypad and <b>commands</b> a <b>transmitter</b> module to send out this code as signal at a given radio frequency. Upon reception of this RF signal by the receiver module, another microcontroller activates a driver circuitry to operate the gate automatically. The codes for the microcontrollers were written in C language and were debugged and compiled using the KEIL Micro vision 4 integrated development environment. The resultant Hex files were programmed into the memories of the microcontrollers with the aid of a universal programmer. Software simulation was carried out using the Proteus Virtual System Modeling (VSM) version 7. 7. A scaled-down prototype of the system was built and tested. The electronically controlled automated security access gate can be useful in providing security for homes, organizations, and automobile terminals. The four-character password required to operate the gate gives the system an increased level of security. Due to its standalone nature of operation the system is cheaper to maintain in comparison with a manually operated type...|$|R
50|$|The Athena rocket uses an Orbit Adjust Module (OAM) {{developed}} by Primex Technologies. Primex {{was acquired by}} General Dynamics in 2001. For the September 28th, 2001 Athena launch, the OAM was built by General Dynamics Space Propulsion Systems of Redmond, WA. The OAM houses the attitude control system and avionics subsystem (guidance and navigation, batteries, telemetry <b>transmitters,</b> <b>command</b> and destruct receivers and antennas). This 1 m long module is fueled with monopropellant hydrazine. After payload separation, the OAM performs a contamination and collision avoidance maneuver, distancing itself from the payload and burning any remaining fuel to depletion. Athena solid rocket motor provider ATK produces integrated upper stages using spin-stabilized or 3-axis stabilized Star solid motors that can provide higher velocities for GEO and escape (e.g. lunar and planetary) missions. Such an integrated upper stage based on a 2531 lb Star 37FM was employed for the launch of Lunar Prospector, the first lunar probe launched by a commercially developed launch vehicle.|$|R

The temperature monitoring system using GSM undergoes three stages signal conditioning circuit, analog to digital converter and with GSM Modem the message is send to mobile. ADC is used because microcontroller works with digital inputs. GSM modem can be used to send and receive SMS through AT <b>commands.</b> At the <b>transmitter</b> side, the user sends an SMS to the GSM modem using AT commands. The LM 35 is an integrated circuit sensor {{that can be used to}} measure temperature with electrical output proportional to the temperature.
