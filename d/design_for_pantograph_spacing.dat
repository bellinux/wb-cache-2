30|$|In recent years, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of stochastic systems, the stability analysis caused much more attention [6 – 10]. Generally speaking, due to the characteristics of stochastic differential equations themselves, it is difficult for us to get analytical solution of equations, therefore, researching the proper numerical methods for a numerical solution has certain theoretical value and practical significance. However, the research for the numerical solution of stochastic pantograph differential equations is still rare. Fan [11] investigated mean-square asymptotic stability of the θ method <b>for</b> linear stochastic <b>pantograph</b> differential equations. Hua [12, 13] developed an almost surely asymptotic stability analytical solution and numerical solution <b>for</b> neutral stochastic <b>pantograph</b> differential equations. Xiao [14] proved mean-square stability of the Milstein method <b>for</b> stochastic <b>pantograph</b> differential equations under suitable conditions. Zhou [15] showed that the Euler-Maruyama method can preserve almost surely exponential stability of stochastic pantograph differential equations under the linear growth conditions, and the backward Euler-Maruyama method can reproduce almost surely exponential stability for highly nonlinear stochastic pantograph differential equations. The numerical research <b>for</b> stochastic <b>pantograph</b> differential equations has just begun, and the stability analysis of the numerical solution of the equations needs further perfection and development.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies to}} {{increase}} train speed are underway with the target {{to design a}} new generation pantograph {{in order to reduce}} aerodynamic noise. The aerodynamic characteristics as shapes of pantograph are the main issue. The present work deals with a high-speed aerodynamic and aeroacoustic analysis of a three-dimensional pantograph model, through the employment of 3 D numerical simulations. In particular, a computational fluid dynamics-based analysis is performed using commercial software code FLUENT AnsysTM and an experimental campaign is performed in the high-speed wind tunnel in order to verify the accuracy of numerical approach. The aerodynamic noise is, then, calculated through the Ffowcs Williams—Hawkings (FW-H) equation to evaluate the flow induced sound pressure level in aeroacoustics. The numerical and experimental results are then compared in terms of sound pressure levels and a well agreement has been found. The numerical results in terms of visualization of pressure distribution on the pantograph provides useful information <b>for</b> <b>pantograph</b> <b>design.</b> The results highlight the possibility to develop a new <b>design</b> of the <b>pantograph</b> <b>for</b> high-speed trains, in order to obtain an aerodynamic noise reduction...|$|R
