30|$|The adverse {{selection}} problem, {{on the other}} hand, arises in the model because, ex-ante, {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between the Low and the High type.

Therefore, the quality of <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> enters our analysis through the channel of the {{adverse selection}} problem, making the adverse selection problem crucial to our theory. Both the moral hazard and adverse selection problems are important in our analysis because they are solved by the informal and <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> respectively.|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In Vietnam, marine {{fisheries}} play {{an important}} role in the national economy and livelihoods of coastal people. However, marine fisheries in Vietnam are severely depleted in recent decades. Although <b>formal</b> <b>institutions,</b> such as, government agencies and government fisheries policies, are responsible for protecting marine fisheries, they have not been successful in managing this sector. Traditionally informal institutions have been in existence and played an important role in Vietnam coastal villages. Despite their importance, the informal institutions have not been recognized and officially documented by the government. This raises a very imperative demand for restructuring of the current fisheries management into one that integrates both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>institutions</b> for sustainable fisheries development. To adjust the current fisheries management based on the integration of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>institutions,</b> it is necessary to understand the role of both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>institutions</b> in managing marine fisheries for sustainable marine fisheries development. This present research is conducted to study the role of both formal and informal institutions; specifically: : (1) to examine the effectiveness of <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> in managing marine fisheries.; (2) to learn about the contributions of informal institutions to marine fisheries management for sustainable fisheries development.; (3) to compare the effectiveness of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>institutions</b> in managing marine fisheries. The research employed an interdisciplinary holistic approach to understand institutions using a case study. This research made use of a combination of qualitative, quantitative, and participatory approaches based on participatory observation, a household survey, group discussions, and interviews to collect the data. The findings of this research indicate that the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions,</b> including the government agencies and other stakeholders, and fisheries regulations and policies responsible for marine fisheries management, have not been successful in addressing the issues of marine fisheries. The ineffectiveness of the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> has exacerbated the decline and depletion of marine fisheries. As a result, the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> could not achieve sustainable fisheries development. Despite the failure of <b>formal</b> <b>institutions,</b> the informal institutions, including fisher’s groups, community norms, fisher’s knowledge, and whale worship, have made remarkable contributions to fisheries management at the local level. These informal institutions seem to be more effective than the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> since they are integral part of traditional fishing practices. Furthermore, the informal institutions provide support to the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> by encouraging fishers to abide by the fisheries laws, rules and regulations. Therefore, proper integration of the informal <b>institutions</b> into the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> could improve fisher’s observance rate of the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions.</b> This could be a good solution to issues facing the current marine fisheries management. The findings of the research assert that, to have better marine fisheries management for sustainable fisheries development, it is imperative to simultaneously improve the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> and take full advantage of the informal institutions...|$|R

As Turgot left Scotland in 1115, no later date would be possible if Bower is to be believed. Many historians have rejected this date, because the Augustinian Rule was not instituted at Nostell until 1119, but as Kenneth Veitch points out, the date of the <b>formal</b> <b>institution</b> of the Rule is little guide to the actual activities of the monastic establishment.

40|$|Why do {{managers}} in emerging markets conduct some {{activities in the}} informal economy {{and others in the}} formal economy when they have a choice? Using institutional economic theory, previous research shows that, at the country level, weak <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> create institutional voids that increase the transaction costs of using the formal economy. To evade high transaction costs, {{managers in}} emerging markets use the informal economy. However, previous research does not explain, at the firm level, why managers in emerging markets conduct some activities in the informal economy while conducting others in the formal economy. I theorize that, at the firm level, managers' social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> protect them against being singled out for enforcement and against potential opportunistic behaviors by business partners. In particular, opportunism, which increases transaction costs, might take place in the informal economy because contracting parties cannot be held legally accountable. That is, managers' social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> allow them to keep the transaction costs of using the informal economy lower than the transaction costs of using the formal economy for a specific activity. Moreover, I argue that not all managers who have social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> are prone to conduct more activities in the informal economy. In particular, based on regulatory focus theory, I argue that managers who have a promotion focus mindset are more prone to use their social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> to conduct activities in the informal economy. Using a sample of 206 Lebanese respondents, I developed two new scales: manager's social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> and manager's propensity to use informal economy. I then used these scales to empirically test my theory. The results of this study support my theory that managers who have social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> are more prone to conduct activities in the informal economy. However, {{the results of this study}} did not support the argument that managers who have a promotion focus mindset are more prone to use their social ties with <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> to conduct activities in the informal economy.

However, such mechanisms are limited to certain communities where members abide by the community norm of not employing one who has cheated someone from that community.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 In {{this thesis}} we present three models {{to analyze the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between social capital and economic growth. Throughout {{it is assumed that}} social capital increases with socialization while it decreases with labor migration. We consider two channels through which social capital affects the economy. First, social capital affects the innovation process (Chapter 2 and 3) and second, it affects the output (Chapter 3). It has also been assumed that the same objective can also be achieved by improving appropriate <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> but doing so is costly. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and discusses related literature. Chapter 2 presents a simple model and shows that in the absence of <b>formal</b> <b>institutions,</b> a higher rate of innovation lowers R&D investment as it weakens the existing informal institutions. Social capital declines due to a decline in socialization time and also because of an increase in the labor migration rate. As a result, rise in the rate of growth rate is lower that what would be predicted by a standard growth model (benchmark case). We show that <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> need to be developed in response to new technological breakthrough because of its detrimental impact on social capital. Chapter 3 extends the model by adding physical capital into the model and analyzes alternative ways to finance a chosen level of expenditure on <b>formal</b> <b>institutions.</b> We find that financing through lump sum tax is growth maximizing, however, tax on consumption results in highest improvement in welfare. In the case where social capital affects output directly (Chapter 4), we analyze the impact of increase in the rate of innovation and an exogenous improvement in <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> financed by lump-sum tax. We find that while both shocks increase {{the rate at which the}} economy grows and decrease the stock of social capital; productivity adjusted physical capital and R&D investment declines when innovation rate goes up while they increase when the <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> are improved. They both result in long-run welfare gain. More effective <b>formal</b> <b>institutions</b> result in even higher economic growth and long-run welfare gain...|$|R
