5|$|Brooke's {{character}} is strongly driven by {{his desire to}} break from conventions. Brooke's unconventional actions are common throughout the novel, the most prominent being nude bathing and odd remarks and humour. These actions create an externally carefree <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> is in strong contrast to the down-to-earth Nell.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E

30|$|Data {{from several}} {{measures}} for <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> did (n =  834) {{and did not}} (n =  219) commit the sunk-cost fallacy are summarized in Table  1. Consistent with previous studies (Bruine de Bruin et al. 2007; Strough et al. 2008, 2011), <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> committed the sunk-cost fallacy tended to be younger than those that did not. Additionally, they reported being significantly more bothered by emotional problems, and reported waiting longer to seek medical attention when they were feeling ill, than <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> did not commit the sunk-cost fallacy. Moreover, <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> committed the sunk-cost fallacy had significantly lower incomes. Examining {{the data from the}} BSI- 18, <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> committed the sunk-cost fallacy displayed more signs of depression than those that did not. This relation, however, was not observed for somatization, or either of the two anxiety subscales. Similarly, <b>individuals</b> <b>that</b> committed the sunk-cost fallacy scored higher on the Binge Eating Scale than those that did not.|$|R

5|$|George Smith's sister Anne {{married and}} had a son named James Christian McGill (1880–1972). McGill was {{orphaned}} {{at a young age}} when his parents died in the mid-1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by Mrs. Smith and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of the comments Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an <b>individual</b> <b>that,</b> due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E

25|$|By convention, {{the larger}} gamete (called an ovum, or egg cell) is {{considered}} female, while the smaller gamete (called a spermatozoon, or sperm cell) is considered male. An <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> produces exclusively large gametes is female, {{and one that}} produces exclusively small gametes is male.

25|$|In {{the science}} of {{ethology}} (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally {{in the study of}} social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an <b>individual</b> <b>that</b> increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.
