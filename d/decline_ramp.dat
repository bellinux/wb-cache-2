40|$|Efficient {{methods to}} model and {{optimise}} {{the design of}} open cut mines have been known for many years. The design of the infrastructure of underground mines has a similar potential for optimisation and strategic planning. Over {{the last five years}} our group has developed two pieces of software to tackle this problem – UNO (Underground Network Optimiser) and DOT (Decline Optimisation Tool). The idea is to connect up a system of <b>declines,</b> <b>ramps,</b> drives and possibly shafts, to minimise capital development and haulage costs over the lifetime of a mine. Constraints that can be handled by the software include: gradient bounds (typically 1 : 7), turning circle restrictions for navigability, and obstacle avoidance. The latter constraint keeps development at stand off distances from orebodies and ensures it avoids regions that involve high cost, such as faults, voids and other geological features. The software is not limited to only interconnecting fixed points. It has the useful feature that a group of points can be specified such that the development is required to connect to one member of the group. So for example, if an existing ventilation rise must be accessed at some level, then a group of points along the rise can be selected. Similarly, this gives the opportunity to use variable length cross-cuts from a decline to an orebody. The latter gives important flexibility and can significantly reduce the development and haulage cost of a design. Finally, the goals for the next phase of development for this project will be discussed, including speeding up the algorithms and allowing for heterogeneous materials, such as aquifers and faults, as additional costs rather than obstacles...|$|R
40|$|A deposit to be mined by {{underground}} {{methods can}} be accessed {{by a number of}} methods: • Adit • <b>Decline</b> or <b>ramp</b> • Inclined shaft • Vertical shaft. Adits are an economical approach when the orebody is above the general floor elevation i. e. suitable in hilly or mountainous terrain. Incline shafts are limited to relatively shallow deposits, and because they are developed on an incline, development lengths for a given depth are the three to five times longer than for a vertical shaft. Vertical shafts are the preferred method for deposits deeper than 300 m but the development rate is slow and construction costs are very high. <b>Declines</b> or <b>ramps</b> offer early access to shallow deposits, which develops the ore body expediently, but are generally developed at a gradient of approximately 12 per cent. Decline haulages have become an attractive alternative to shaft hoisting, and over recent years the role of decline access has become more widespread throughout South Africa. Traditionally, South Africa has enjoyed the use of shaft systems, largely due to the large knowledge base of mining the Witwatersrand Basin, where vertical and inclined shafts were the norm. South Africa has also had the advantage of cheap electricity, giving shafts a definite economic advantage. However, in recent years the national power utility ESKOM has undergone an expansion programme that has led to tariff increases of nearly 100 % over a three-year period. Based on the changes in electricity tariffs and technological improvements to underground haulage trucks, the economic inputs to access development have changed. This paper reviews mine access for shallow deposits as currently applied in South Africa. Based on current economic inputs, the paper investigates at what point a vertical shaft would be more economical than a decline system utilizing typical South African mining equipment...|$|R
500|$|The tomb {{chambers}} of Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu are located deep within Mount Liang, {{a trend that}} was set by Emperor Taizong (r. 626–49) with his burial at Mount Jiuzong. Of the 18 emperors of the Tang dynasty, 14 of these had natural mountains serving as the earthen mounds for their tombs. Only members of the imperial family were allowed to have their tombs located within natural mountains; tombs for officials and nobles featured man-made tumulus mounds and tomb chambers that were totally underground. Xinian Fu wrote that [...] "Children of emperors were allowed tombs {{in the shape of}} truncated pyramids, but high-ranking officials and lesser tomb constructors could only have conical mounds. The conical tombs of officials were allowed to have one wall surrounding it, but only one gate—positioned to the south—was permitted. The attendant tombs thus far excavated at Qianling feature truncated pyramid mounds above underground chambers that are approached by <b>declining</b> diagonal <b>ramps</b> with ground-level entrances. There are six vertical shafts for the ramps of each of these tombs which allowed goods to be lowered into the side niches of the ramps.|$|R

The final version is available from American Physiological Society via the DOI in this record. © 2016 the American Physiological Society. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate (NO 3 -) -rich beetroot juice (BR) supplementation could partially offset deteriorations in O 2 transport and utilization and exercise tolerance after blood donation. Twenty-two healthy volunteers performed moderate-intensity and ramp incremental cycle exercise tests prior to and following withdrawal of ~ 450 ml of whole blood. Before donation, all subjects consumed seven 70 -ml shots of NO 3 [...] depleted BR [placebo (PL) ] in the 48 h preceding the exercise tests. During the 48 h after blood donation, subjects consumed seven shots of BR (each containing 6. 2 mmol of NO 3 -, n = 11) or PL (n. = 11) before repeating the exercise tests. Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit were reduced by ~ 8 - 9 % following blood donation (P < 0. 05), with {{no difference between the}} BR and PL groups. Steady-state 02 uptake during moderate-intensity exercise was ~ 4 % lower after than before donation in the BR group (P < 0. 05) but was unchanged in the PL group. The ramp test peak power decreased from predonation (341 ± 70 and 331 ± 68 W in PL and BR, respectively) to postdonation (324 ± 69 and 322 ± 66 W in PL and BR, respectively) in both groups (P < 0. 05). However, the decrement in performance was significantly less in the BR than PL group (2. 7 % vs. 5. 0 %, P < 0. 05). NO 3 supplementation reduced the 02 cost of moderate-inten-sity exercise and attenuated the <b>decline</b> in <b>ramp</b> incremental exercise performance following blood donation. These results have implications for improving functional capacity following blood loss. We thank James White Drinks (Ipswich, UK) for donating the juices used in the study.

40|$|In 2005, Andra {{concluded}} that the feasibility of deep geological repository for high level (HAVL) and intermediate level (MAVL) long-lived waste is valid. Hence, Andra is now responsible for designing and implementing a repository disposal for HAVL and MAVL waste called: CIGEO (Geological Repository Project). A zone of interest for thorough exploration (ZIRA) was proposed in 2009. A simulation program {{is included in the}} project CIGEO. Various phenomenological themes have been addressed. One of the studied topics consists in the investigation of 'the mechanical evolution of structures", and especially the analysis of the mechanical (or hydromechanical) response of underground structures due to unloading during excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} analyze and compare the hydromechanical (HM) response due to unloading during excavation works and to have a relevant image of a coherent initial EDZ from a work to another (shafts, <b>ramps,</b> <b>declines,</b> galleries, HAVL and MAVL cells, intersection of works) on the basis of a same approach/model. This study will provide some answers with respect to the EDZ formation (location, onset of shear and/or extension fractures, diffuse damage of claystone between fractures [...] .), its features (3 D spatial organization of fracturing, shape of initial EDZ, fracture density [...] .) and the HM response (stress and strain fields, pore pressure fields, particularly near fractures and in claystone between fractures [...] .) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the tension responses to ramp shortening and rapid temperature jump (< 0. 2 ms, 3 – 4 °C T-jump) in maximally Ca 2 +-activated rabbit psoas muscle fibres at 8 – 9 °C (the fibre length (L 0) was ∼ 1. 5 mm and sarcomere length 2. 5 μm). The {{aim was to}} investigate the strain sensitivity of crossbridge force generation in muscle. The T-jump induced tension rise was examined during steady shortening over a wide range of velocities (V) approaching the Vmax (V range ∼ 0. 01 to ∼ 1. 5 L 0 s− 1). In the isometric state, a T-jump induced a biphasic tension rise consisting of a fast (∼ 50 s− 1, phase 2 b) and a slow (∼ 10 s− 1, phase 3) component, but if treated as monophasic the rate was ∼ 20 s− 1. During steady shortening the T-jump tension rise was monophasic; the rate of tension rise increased linearly with shortening velocity, and near Vmax it was ∼ 200 s− 1, ∼ 10 × faster than in the isometric state. Relative to the tension reached after the T-jump, the amplitude increased with shortening velocity, and near Vmax it was ∼ 4 × larger than in the isometric state. Thus, the temperature sensitivity of muscle force is markedly increased with velocity during steady shortening, as found in steady state experiments. The rate of tension <b>decline</b> during <b>ramp</b> shortening also increased markedly with increase of velocity. The absolute amplitude of T-jump tension rise was larger than that in the isometric state at the low velocities (< 0. 5 L 0 s− 1) but decreased to below that of the isometric state at the higher velocities. Such a biphasic velocity dependence of the absolute amplitude of T-jump tension rise implies interplay between, at least, two processes that have opposing effects on the tension output as the shortening velocity is increased, probably enhancement of crossbridge force generation and faster (post-stroke) crossbridge detachment by negative strain. Overall, our results show that T-jump force generation is strain sensitive and becomes considerably faster when exposed to negative strain. Thus the crossbridge force generation step in muscle is both temperature sensitive (endothermic) and strain sensitive...|$|R
40|$|We examined, over a {{wide range}} of {{temperatures}} (10 – 35 °C), the isometric tension and tension during ramp shortening at different velocities (0. 2 – 4 L 0 /s) in tetanized intact fibre bundles from a rat fast (flexor hallucis brevis) muscle; fibre length (L 0) was 2. 2  mm and sarcomere length ~ 2. 5  μm. During a ramp shortening, the tension change showed an initial inflection of small amplitude (P 1), followed by a larger exponential decline towards an approximate steady level; the tension continued to decline slowly afterwards and the approximate steady tension at a given velocity was estimated as the tension (P 2) at the point of intersection between two linear slopes, as previously described (Roots et al. 2007). At a given temperature, the tension P 2 declined to a lower level and at a faster rate (from an exponential curve fit) as the shortening velocity was increased; the temperature sensitivity of the rate of tension <b>decline</b> during <b>ramp</b> shortening at different velocities was low (Q 10 0. 9 – 1. 5). The isometric tension and the P 2 tension at a given shortening velocity increased with warming so that the relation between tension and (reciprocal) temperature was sigmoidal in both. In isometric muscle, the temperature T 0. 5 for half-maximal tension was ~ 10 °C, activation enthalpy change (∆H) was ~ 100  kJ mol− 1 and entropy change (∆S) ~ 350  J mol− 1  K− 1. In shortening, these were increased with increase of velocity so that at a shortening velocity (~ 4 L 0 /s) producing maximal power at 35 °C, T 0. 5 was ~ 28 °C, ∆H was ~ 200  kJ mol− 1 and ∆S ~  700 J mol− 1  K− 1; the same trends were seen in the tension data from isotonic release experiments on intact muscle and in ramp shortening experiments on maximally Ca-activated skinned fibres. In general, our findings show that the sigmoidal relation between force and temperature can be extended from isometric to shortening muscle; the implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the crossbridge cycle. The data indicate that the endothermic, entropy driven process that underlies crossbridge force generation in isometric muscle (Zhao and Kawai 1994; Davis, 1998) is even more pronounced in shortening muscle, i. e. when doing external work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article aims {{to review}} the issues to be {{considered}} in choosing primary access and transportation options for underground mines. The main accesses to underground orebodies are declines or vertical shafts. They serve both as a way to transport ore or waste, and move people, equipment or supplies. In underground mines, the ore transport option significantly affects the productivity and profitability of the company. Then, choice of access is a way to reduce costs and improve production. This study is primarily based on some case studies of Brazilian, South African, Australian and Turkish mines, among others. Literature review shows that the depth at which shaft hoisting becomes a more economically attractive alternative to decline truck haulage is changing from being previously 350 m to present 1000 m, depending on the mining country and cultural underground mine development. For some of them the depth of 1000 m would be the threshold for use of the access by decline. The main criteria in determining access are depth, rate of production and mine life. In South Africa, mines reach depths greater than 3000 m and shaft access is more common. In Australia there are mines that use a <b>ramp</b> (<b>decline)</b> to a depth greater than 1000 m. In Brazil, underground mines are still shallow (depth up to 800 m) and feature short mine life and, most of them have chosen access by decline. Results of this study corroborate the statement that decline is ideal for shallow mines and low production rates and that shaft is for deep mines, high production rate and long mine life...|$|R
