50|$|A seventh kiln {{was erected}} {{at the western}} end <b>of</b> the south <b>battery</b> in the 1940s, which was used to dry chalk with the eighth kiln being added at the {{opposite}} end in 1958. By the end of the 1950s, the north battery had been demolished and only the eastern end wall now remains. Following the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> the north <b>battery,</b> the overhead crane was also dismantled and the south battery was enlarged and converted to draw kilns. Following the dismantling of the crane, the kilns were loaded using a dragline excavator placed on the higher ground to the south and unloaded by a portable conveyor belt pushed into the draw holes.|$|R
50|$|Despite this, {{the only}} {{restoration}} work done {{to date has}} been the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> the hotel structures built on the battery, {{and the removal of}} vegetation. GAP Developments plc has stated that it is committed to the restoration <b>of</b> the <b>battery,</b> despite the slow pace of the works.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{of these}} {{buildings}} required the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> the structures which were located on their sites. The most notorious was the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, erected in Moscow {{as a memorial}} of Napoleon's defeat. The site was required for the Palace of the Soviets, which was never built. The <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> historic buildings, especially churches, {{to make way for}} the new communist structures was a general trait of communist urbanism. A more recent example was the <b>Demolition</b> <b>of</b> historical parts of Bucharest by Nicolae Ceauşescu who aimed to rebuild the capital in a socialist realist style.|$|R

50|$|In 1928 {{the current}} road named ‘The Friary’ was built across the former Friary site. The {{building}} of this road necessitated {{the relocation of}} the clock tower, the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> buildings {{on the south side}} of St John’s Street and the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> much of the west range of the remaining buildings from the original Friary. Some of the remains from the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> the west range was used to build the public convenience located on the north east entrance to Beacon Park. The roads were declared open by Lady Cooper in April 1928.|$|R
40|$|The <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> a {{facility}} historically used for processing and handling transuranic materials is considered. Residual alpha emitting radionuclide contamination poses an exposure hazard if {{released to the}} local environment during the <b>demolition.</b> The process <b>of</b> planning for the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> this highly alpha contaminated building, 232 -Z, included a predemolition modeling analysis of potential exposures. Estimated emission rates were used as input to an air dispersion model to estimate frequencies of occurrence of peak air and surface exposures. Postdemolition modeling was also conducted, based on the actual demolition schedule and conditions. The modeling results indicated that downwind deposition is the main operational limitation for <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> a highly alpha-contaminated building. During the <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> 232 -Z, airborne radiation and surface contamination were monitored. The resultant non-detect monitoring results indicate a significant level of conservatism in the modeled results. This comparison supports the use of more realistic assumption in the estimating emission rates. The resultant reduction in modeled levels of potential exposures has significant implications {{in terms of the}} projected costs <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> such structures...|$|R
50|$|By {{the spring}} of 2012, three anchors, Macy's, Mervyn’s, and Montgomery Ward, two restaurants, Trail Dust Steakhouse and Steak & Ale, the cinema and {{remaining}} mall corridor had been demolished.

40|$|Abstract. Brick wall collapses {{contributing}} to occupational fatalities constantly happen to construction-related workers. The {{number of workers}} involved in brick wall collapse accidents is more than that in other accident types. The brick wall collapse accidents accounted for 93 % of the structure collapse cases, and about 64 % of brick wall collapse cases are in connection with <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> brick walls. In order {{to find out the}} major risks <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> brick walls, this article examines occupational accident statistics and case reports from the Northern Region Inspection Office of the Council of Labor Affairs of Taiwan. Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) is employed to discuss the collapse behavior for <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> brick walls.
