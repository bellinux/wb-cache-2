Each egg {{containing}} a dead embryo on {{each day and}} all eggs {{at the end of}} incubation period were removed from incubator and chilled at + 4  °C overnight. Allantoic fluids were harvested and tested by Haemagglutination (HA) test for its ability to haemagglutinate chicken RBCs. A minimum of two serial passages in embryonated eggs were performed for each sample to enhance viral copy number.|$|R
40|$|Fertility eggs test are {{steps that}} must be {{performed}} {{in an attempt to}} hatch eggs. Fertility test usually use <b>egg</b> <b>candling.</b> The purpose of observation is to choose eggs fertile (eggs contained embryos) and infertile eggs (eggs that are no embryos). And then fertilized egg will be entered into the incubator for hatching eggs and infertile can be egg consumption. However, there are obstacles in the process of sorting the eggs are less time efficient and inaccuracies of human vision to distinguish between fertile and infertile eggs. To overcome this problem, it can be used Computer Vision technology is having such a principle of human vision. It used to identify an object based on certain characteristics, so that the object can be classified. The aim of this study to comparasion classify image fertile and infertile eggs with SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm and K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm based on input from bloodspot texture analysis and blood vessels with GLCM (Gray Level Co-ocurance Matrix). Eggs image studied are 6 day old eggs. It is expected that the proposed method is an appropriate method for classification image fertile and infertile eggs...|$|R

Three embryonated chicken eggs of 9 to 11 -day-old per sample were used for inoculation (Alexander and Senne 2008).

50|$|There is {{a wooden}} icon {{table on the}} rear wall of the building. A <b>candle</b> <b>table</b> is {{attached}} to it, with holes drilled inside for the candles. A little higher is a shelf for one icon with embellished front edge. Three old icon frames are situated on the icon shelf and in the rear wall, with new printed icon pictures in them. According to 1974 descriptions (Kupp 1974) the icons were still there, but had decomposed. There are a few printed icons hung on the rear wall. A forged hook fixed on the ceiling for holding an oil lamp has also remained from earlier times. During 1974 expedition, a few interesting furnishings were discovered, described as follows: “A few ethnographic items may be of interest: 2 candle sticks. Both {{of them have been}} made of wood, first one is carved, the other one probably turned. The bases are round-shaped. A bench for the fresh-harvested crop. The bench is hewn from boards, it is rather old. The length of the bench is 1.09 m, width 0.41 m, height 0.72 m. It is of museal interest.” (Kupp 1974).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} some physical properties of ostrich egg, including eggshell porosity, dimensional and gravimetric properties which were nondestructively measured to find any probable correlation between these properties and egg fertility. Currently one of the blockade problems in ostrich egg production industry is the impossibility of <b>egg</b> <b>candling</b> prior to hatching. Therefore, fractions of the hatcher are occupied by infertile eggs and soon fall to decay without any economical use. Totally 301 eggs were sampled during three consecutive weeks of June. The results showed overall, about 63 % of the eggs were fertile and among these eggs, 7 % were not hatched successfully. No significant correlation observed between physical properties of eggs and fertility. However, the data analysis on frequency of fertile and infertile eggs of different categorized properties indicated that some groups of eggs might have a higher fertile eggs frequency than infertile eggs. In general, the groups of eggs with aspect ratio about 1. 2, weight of 1500 g, density of 1. 15 g cm - 3 and average shell pore diameter of less than 750 μm had a higher fertile egg frequency than infertile egg frequency. On the other hand, egg volume and dielectric properties had the least impact on egg fertility. Image processing of the eggshell pigment and thermal photography are recommended for further investigations...|$|R

40|$|Santa Maria De Fatima Church {{once was}} a {{traditional}} Chinese residence that belonged to a Chinese noble located in Chinatown so this building is still preserves its Chinese style. This research is an interesting object to study because this traditional Chinese residence was refunctioned into a Catholic Church. This research 2 ̆ 7 s aims are to understand the adaptation process that has been occurred between Catholic and Chinese culture {{in the interior of}} the church and also to find out how much the adaptation have taken place. This research was done by an observational method by collecting data through literature, interview, observation, and documentation. The results indicate that the adaptation process between Catholic and Chinese have occurred in the church. Catholic elements that have undergone adaptation interior are the building, facade, building organization, partition, <b>candle</b> <b>table,</b> tabernacle table, tabernacle, statues of lion stone, pillar, peony flower, roof consul, and accessories. Chinese elements that have undergone adaptation are layout and sedilia. The elements that adapt to each other on the church are spatial elements, transition elements, altar table, pulpit, lighting, meandering carvings, and wall illustrations.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the reproductive biology of the genus Squatina and aims to complement the criteria, uniformity and adaptable staging of sexual maturity scales for elasmobranchs {{based on data from}} the angel shark S. squatina captured near the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Central-East Atlantic). Both sexes presented a paired reproductive tract with both sides active and asymmetric gonad development. Microscopic and macroscopic observations of the testes were consistent and indicated seasonality of spermatogenesis. The spermatocyst development pattern in mature individuals could not be assigned to any of the categories described in the literature. The ovaries-epigonal organ association was of the external type. Although all Squatinidae share a conservative morphology, they show differences across species in the functionality of the paired reproductive tract, seasonality of spermatogenesis, coiled spermatozoa and the presence of <b>egg</b> <b>candles.</b> A flexible classification technique was used to describe an illustrated 5 -stage sexual maturity scale using an ontogenic approach, assessable by macroscopic condition indices. The phases include juvenile, subadult, developing, active/pregnant and spent/post-partum in males and females, respectively. Claspers were considered calcified when it was necessary to break a clasper when bending the axial cartilage 180 ° over its longitudinal axis. Recent general maturity scale proposals for elasmobranchs could not be adapted. The interspecific variations in fish development, which do not facilitate a standard terminology across all fishes, indicate the need for species-specific and adaptable macroscopic and microscopic staging schema, rather than using generalized classification systems...|$|R

During incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid ...|$|R
