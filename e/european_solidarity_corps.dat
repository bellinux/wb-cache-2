40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the concept of <b>European</b> <b>solidarity</b> by {{distinguishing}} between transnational and international solidarity. The former refers to support for institutional arrangements aimed at sharing economic risks at the individual level, while the latter entails public agreement to share economic risks at the Member State level. We explore the joint role of cross-border interactions and political attitudes in fostering <b>solidarity</b> ties among <b>Europeans</b> through multilevel modelling based on the 2012 Eurobarometer 77 survey. The article shows that transnational experiences {{do not have the}} same effect on different forms of <b>European</b> <b>solidarity,</b> limiting transnational and enhancing international solidarity. Egalitarian individuals are more prone to EU-wide solidarity, with cross-border practices affecting their level of solidarity, while not altering those of the rest of the population. In particular, we find that cross-border practices make egalitarians more inclined to international and less to transnational solidarity...|$|R

40|$|How can {{the euro}} area's return to fiscal {{sustainability}} be organised {{in view of}} soaring debt levels and the sovereign debt crisis? How can we finance our debts efficiently, not least to prevent debt crises in weaker countries where high debt levels compounded by a hike in risk premiums on government bonds can create a debt trap? This looks like a classic dilemma. <b>European</b> <b>solidarity</b> with the most vulnerable European Union countries {{runs the risk of}} further weakening the incentives for individual countries to pursue fiscally sustainable policies. While not a quick fix, our Blue Bond proposal charts an incentive-driven and durable way out of this dilemma while helping prepare the ground for the rise of the euro as an important reserve currency, which could reduce borrowing costs for everybody involved. Soaring debt levels and the crisis in Greece has sharpened the focus on fiscal sustainability among eurozone members. The European Union has to tackle high debt levels in vulnerable states which are compounded by a hike in risk premiums on government bonds leading to a debt trap, while designing ways to efficiently finance debt. Furthermore, <b>European</b> <b>solidarity</b> with weaker states should not undermine incentives for individual members to pursue fiscally sustainable policies. This Policy Brief proposes a Blue Bond to resolve these challenges.

The interplay between the single market and the national social systems is key in defining who owes what to whom under the 'transnationalised' <b>European</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Free movement rights have increased the 'entanglement' of national social systems' revenue and expenditure sides, considered to jeopardise their steering capacity. As a corollary to free movement, transnational solidarity does not take place beyond or between national welfare states, but rather within: as solidarity with strangers. Here transnational solidarity is applied by way of a sociological framework to trace the evolutionary path of free movement of persons as it fluctuates between 'commodification' and 'decommodification'. Against that backdrop, this article reviews whether a paradigm shift is currently promoted as to the question where solidarity with strangers begins and ends...|$|R
