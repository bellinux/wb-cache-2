40|$|Abstract. Linear <b>discrimination</b> <b>analysis</b> (LDA) {{technique}} {{is an important}} and well-developed area of image recognition and to date many linear discrimination methods have been put forward. Basically, in LDA the image always needs to be transformed into 1 D vector, however recently twodimensional PCA (2 DPCA) technique have been proposed. In 2 DPCA, PCA {{technique is}} applied directly on the original images without transforming into 1 D vector. In this paper, we propose a new LDA-based method that applies the idea of two-dimensional PCA. In addition to that, our approach proposes an method called Discriminative Common Images based on a variation of Fisher’s LDA for face recognition.

40|$|Abstract—Linear <b>discrimination</b> <b>analysis</b> (LDA) {{technique}} {{is an important}} and well-developed area of image recognition and to date many linear discrimination methods have been put forward. Despite these efforts, there persist in LDA at least three areas of weakness. The first weakness is that not all the discrimination vec-tors that are obtained are useful in pattern classification. Second, it remains computationally expensive to make the discrimination vectors completely satisfy statistical uncorrelation. The third weakness {{is that it is}} necessary to select the appropriate principal components. In this paper, we propose to improve discrimination technique in these three areas and to that end present an improved LDA (ILDA) approach which synthesizes these improvements.
