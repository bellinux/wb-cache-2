25|$|Some smart TV {{platforms}} {{also support}} <b>interactive</b> <b>advertising,</b> addressable advertising with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising, and other advanced advertising {{features such as}} ad telescoping using VOD and DVR, enhanced TV for consumer call-to-action and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness. The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means that smart TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.|$|E

25|$|The {{new media}} {{industry}} shares an open association with many market segments {{in areas such}} as software/video game design, television, radio, mobile and particularly movies, advertising and marketing, through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the Internet. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the television industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar <b>interactive</b> <b>advertising</b> subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases advertising agencies have also set up new divisions to study new media. Public relations firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through interactive PR practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media to reach a mass audience of online social network users.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines consumer {{attitudes towards}} four SUb-types of interactive digital advertising: internet-based e-and email advertising, and mobile-phone-based SMS- and MMS-type advertising. The differences in attitudes among these four sub-types of <b>interactive</b> digital <b>advertising</b> are also compared. Data are collected from three universities in Taiwan. Data analysis extracts three attitudinal forms (common factors) towards <b>interactive</b> digital <b>advertising,</b> namely, 'informative', 'entertaining' and 'irritating'. Consumer attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are both similar and positive (i. e. informative and less irritating and entertaining). Their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type in-advertising are less positive (more irritating and less informative and entertaining). Furthermore, the three attitudinal forms towards the four SUb-types of <b>interactive</b> digital <b>advertising</b> are compared. Consumer 'informative' and 'entertaining' attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are similar, while their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising are equal and lower than towards {{the previous two}} sub-types of <b>interactive</b> digital <b>advertising.</b> As for the 'irritating' attitudinal form, consumers feel more 'irritated' towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising, while their attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are equal and less irritated...|$|R
