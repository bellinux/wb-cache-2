5|$|Two {{species of}} {{woodpeckers}} in the Americas, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the imperial woodpecker, {{have been considered}} extinct since the mid-to-late 20th century, though there have been possible but disputed sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the United States since 2004, and a small population may survive in Cuba. Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population {{of a few hundred}} birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam and <b>helipad</b> construction, road building and agricultural development.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in {{the centre of the}} island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since. Flat Holm's <b>helipad</b> still remains, however, at the centre of the island.|$|E

50|$|In 2010 Awaaz Foundation tested {{noise levels}} of {{helicopters}} after several leading Industrialists applied {{for permission to}} build private <b>helipads</b> atop their residential buildings in densely populated areas of Mumbai. After the data was presented in court. permission to use private <b>helipads</b> in all urban areas of India were banned by the MoEF.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{she wrote}} to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for more {{stringent}} Noise Rules {{and the need for}} national data on noise pollution. The MoEF amended the Noise Rules in January 2010 incorporating all her suggestions and also announced a National Noise Monitoring Network of the Central Pollution Control Board in India. She opposed the use of private <b>helipads</b> atop rooftops in Mumbai. In 2010, the State Government gave permission for rooftop <b>helipads</b> on Sea Wind and Antilia, homes of two of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. Following her signature campaign, the MoEF said such <b>helipads</b> were 'avoidable' and their use would not be permitted in any Indian city. In 2016 the Bombay High Court re confirmed that the Government would have to consider additional noise pollution from private <b>helipads</b> before giving any permissions.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the <b>helipad.</b>|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A <b>helipad</b> {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E
5|$|Under Sinatra, the Celebrity Room {{was added}} {{alongside}} a <b>helipad</b> and it opened year round. His ownership gradually {{increased over the}} following two years until he owned 50 percent outright. But Giancana's attendance at the property first provoked a rift between Sinatra and share holder Hank Sanicola, and later resulted in Sinatra's gambling license being suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. He initially leased the property to Jack L. Warner and later in 1968 {{to a group of}} investors. It passed through the hands of a series of investment groups until 1976 when it was bought by Kirk Kerkorian. The property closed for renovations in 2013 and has not reopened since. Larry Ellison made a winning bid to purchase the property out of bankruptcy in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Federer and Andre Agassi played {{each other}} 11 times between 1998 and 2005 before Agassi's {{retirement}} in 2006. Federer led the rivalry 8â€“3. This was Federer's most significant rivalry with an all-time great {{player of the}} previous generation. They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer's hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two days with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a <b>helipad</b> almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final match was {{at one of the}} most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the 2005 US Open. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.|$|E
5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the <b>helipad,</b> then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by show runner and {{executive}} producer Shonda Rhimes, while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it. Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere, after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's <b>helipad.</b> This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily filmed in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle.|$|E
