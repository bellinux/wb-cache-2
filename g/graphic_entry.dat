5000|$|Upon its release, {{the movie}} {{had to be}} {{subjected}} to some cuts in the sequences of Dan's, Mark's and Greta's deaths, in order to avoid being classified X by MPAA due to the extremely violent and graphic nature of those sequences. An unrated version of the film was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc. This version contained longer, more graphic versions of Dan's, Greta's and Mark's death scenes. In Dan's scene, cables can be seen sliding under the skin of Dan's arm, a large piece of the bike pierces his leg, and the skin on Dan's head is much more graphically torn off while he screams in pain. In Greta's scene, Freddy slices open a doll that begins to bleed, and Greta is shown to have a gaping wound in her stomach—from which Freddy starts to feed to her. In Australia, the scenes were cut in cinemas, but restored to the VHS release. In Mark's death sequence, Freddy turns him into paper and shreds him to pieces, before beheading him; decapitation scene was deleted in the original version of the film. Despite this, the Australian Classification board did not rate it [...] "R18+", giving it the lower [...] "M15+". As of 2010, New Line Cinema has yet to officially release the uncut version of the film on DVD; however, snippets of these scenes are found in the Nightmare 5 section of the documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy. According to the Internet Movie Database, despite the movie having a much lower body count than the previous films of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, The Dream Child is the most violent and <b>graphic</b> <b>entry</b> of the whole series, as well as the only chapter to immediately receive a X rating by MPAA.|$|E

SDAIE teaches grade-level subject matter in English and is specifically designed for speakers of other languages. It consists of a rigorous academic core at the student's grade level. Clients for SDAIE have intermediate proficiencies in English and cognitive skills in their primary language. SDAIE is based on Vygotsky's fundamental notion that learning is social in nature, thus, it must involve collaborative and cooperative learning as well as scaffolding. Expressive writing {{is used in the}} SDAIE method to encourage students to make connections with content through journal entries, quick writes, and <b>graphic</b> organizer <b>entries.</b> The role of the primary language is strategic as primary language literacy is a link to the rigorous content instruction.

Research questions explore the use of iSCORE by parents, students and teacher to foster SRL, and the observed changes and practices that arise during the period of implementation. One teacher-researcher and eight students participated in the study. Data were drawn from a teacher’s journal containing weekly lessons’ descriptive narrations, and from students’ portfolio entries. Results show that students were generally resistant to explore the tool without teacher’s assistance, especially during home practice. The showcasing works was more popular than the process aspect of the portfolio in users. <b>Graphic</b> data <b>entry</b> was preferred over text. Some positive changes in self-regulated behavior were observed in students, possibly more connected to a pedagogical emphasis on SRL than to actual portfolio work. Time expenditure and the lack of familiarity of students with the process embedded in iSCORE were some of the obstacles encountered through implementation. Implications for re-design, future research and better implementation are discussed. 	Keywords: piano studio, self-regulation, electronic portfolio. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} part of the final report and the {{deliverables}} for TR 0002, Collision Recording and Documentation, sponsored by California Office of Traffic Safety, and contracted through California Department of Transportation. Roadway incidents, especially collisions, often result in traffic congestion and travel delays, in addition to the direct damage to the vehicles and the injuries to the people involved. The subsequent congestion is mainly caused by stopped vehicles or lane closure, but it is often intensified by slowing vehicles with drivers observing the accident scene. The effects of these phenomena on the highway transportation system are significant in terms of their direct hazards and the associated losses in time delays, energy usage, and environmental impact. The subject discussed in this report focuses on the post-incident handling phase of the problem, with the intention to moderate roadway congestion and to enhance the safety of law-enforcing officers. The project is sponsored by the California Office of Traffic Safety, and conducted by California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) program with assistance from California Highway Patrol (CHP). The objective of the study is to develop application tools, represented by a combination of computer hardware and software that can be used by CHP to record, document, and analyze roadway incidents quickly and effectively. The key is to reduce the time spent by officers on the incident scene, thus resulting in a direct decrease in roadway blockage and/or traffic congestion. With the recent developments of powerful processors and low-cost electronics, there have been a large number of hand-held computers in circulation in the last few years. The portability and the low-cost features of such devices prompt us to envision that a hand-held computer is an excellent candidate for law-enforcement use, in particular for the type of applications that we have proposed. Our concept then evolves from a portable computer into an architecture that encompasses a collection of mobile platform with versatile software, wireless communication, and database functionality. In this report, we described the development process of an application tool that is intended for the use by law-enforcement officers. The application tool is targeted for information gathering at traffic accident scenes. The potential benefits lie in the resultant reduction of incident documentation time, and thus leading to a faster scene restoration, traffic resumption, and reduced congestion caused by roadway incidents or collisions. During the development of this tool, we have seriously considered the real-world concerns of users and communicated through several channels to ensure the desirable features are implemented properly. The focus was placed on the time saving and user-friendly requirements that are absolutely necessary for the tool's intended use. Initial efforts have resulted in a functional module that possesses text and <b>graphics</b> <b>entry</b> options, menu-driven displays, and a report retrieval database. Since the mobile platform is conceived as an integral component of an incident documentation system, it is structured adaptively for additions of other input and communication devices. The flexibility in the functionality of the tool presents a great potential {{to be used as a}} stand-alone module or to be coupled with expanded functions. As mentioned earlier, the usability of the basic application can be greatly enhanced by integrating input devices with the mobile platform. In the implementation described in this report, the tools that were used, such as the wireless devices, and the software options, such as operating systems and display presentations, were all adopted from the commercially available products. As a result, we demonstrated that an integration of commercial-off-the-shelf products can be a successful approach for the developments of incident handling tools. On the other hand, we should also realize that the evolution of hardware and software products occur very quickly. Therefore at any stage of deployment, extensive search and thorough evaluation of latest developments in related areas should be conducted. Devices that provide additional features and cost-effective options will prove to be more powerful and suitable choices for those tools deployed by future studies. ...|$|R
40|$|A simple, {{unbiased}} insulin-varying glucose clamp {{program is}} described. The {{aim of the}} program was to utilize a continuously updated array of data to predict insulin requirements for normoglycaemia. In assessing Type 1 diabetes the quantity of insulin required for maintenance of basal euglycaemia can be more clinically informative than other clamp methods. We present a method which uses an iterative computer program to predict changes in insulin infusion rate required for glucose clamping. After initial parameter estimation, the program uses no fixed algorithm but makes predictions according to previous blood glucose responses to infusion rates. The program has flexible data <b>entry,</b> <b>graphic</b> display, and running statistics including mean infusion data, mean glucose levels, and their respective standard deviations. Data for 26 consecutive overnight clamp studies have been analysed. The median coefficient of variation of glucose values {{at the end of the}} clamp was 4. 1 % (range 1. 4 - 12. 0 %). The mean bias during the last 2 h was 0. 20 +/- 0. 24 mmol l- 1.

40|$|International audienceToll-like receptors (TLRs) play a {{key role}} in the innate immune system. TLRs {{recognize}} pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate an intracellular kinase cascade to induce an immediate defensive response. During recent years TLRs have become the focus of tremendous research interest. A central repository for the growing amount of relevant TLR sequence information has been created. Nevertheless, structural motifs of most sequenced TLR proteins, such as leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), are poorly annotated in the established databases. A database that organizes the structural motifs of TLRs could be useful for developing pattern recognition programs, structural modeling and understanding functional mechanisms of TLRs. We describe TollML, a database that integrates all of the TLR sequencing data from the NCBI protein database. Entries were first divided into TLR families (TLR 1 - 23) and then semi-automatically subdivided into three levels of structural motif categories: (1) signal peptide (SP), ectodomain (ECD), transmembrane domain (TD) and Toll/IL- 1 receptor (TIR) domain of each TLR; (2) LRRs of each ECD; (3) highly conserved segment (HCS), variable segment (VS) and insertions of each LRR.
