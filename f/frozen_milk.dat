Goat's milk has a seasonal production characteristic and shows periods of abundance and others of scarcity.

40|$|Freezing {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a dependable and economical method of preserving perishable foods. Particularly within {{the last two or}} three decades many advances have been made in this field. There is no doubt today that the art and science of freezing technology have advanced to a point where one can obtain many high quality, nutritious and economical frozen foods. The dairy industry is continually being faced with the problem of seasonal surpluses and shortages. Any technique which would allow surpluses to be carried over into shortage periods would be highly desirable to this industry. <b>Frozen</b> <b>milks</b> may be one such answer. Milk can be produced at lower cost during the spring and summer than during the fall and winter, therefore, it would be an advantage to process milk into such forms that will be suitable for future use. Storage of <b>frozen</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> appears to have possibilities in aiding the needs of the industry and to supply the fluid milk trade with high-quality milk. Furthermore, concentrated milk may have a place in non-milk-producing areas, particularly where transportation is an important cost factor. Though frozen cream has been a standard product in the manufacture of ice cream mixes, the freezing of fluid and concentrated milks for direct consumption has not been practised on any large scale. A <b>frozen</b> three-to-one concentrated <b>milk</b> is not a new product since experimental work goes back to the early 1930 's. However, technical advances, as compared with other industries, were slow, probably due to the unique physical and chemical properties of milk. Protein instability and flavor deterioration have been the main obstacles, either of which limits the storage period. As the storage period is extended this product will undoubtedly develop greater potentials. Since <b>frozen</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> is a food product, attention must be given to the bacterial flora. Further, to add to the knowledge of a comparatively new product and in hope of obtaining information applicable to the industry, studies have been undertaken to determine the effects of processing and storage on the numbers and types of bacteria in <b>frozen</b> concentrated <b>milk...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} test if milk {{preserved}} with bronopol can be reliably used for fatty acid determination. Dairy production and milk quality are often monitored regularly to assess performance {{and contribute to}} selection indices. With evidence that fat composition can be influenced by selective breeding, {{there might be an}} interest in using samples collected in routine testing to evaluate individual cow fatty acid profiles, contributing to breeding indices. However, most recording services use a preservative such as bronopol and there is no published record if this influences subsequent fatty acid analysis. This study used milk from an oil seed supplementation trial, generating a wide range of milk fatty acid profiles, to test if the concentration of 31 individual fatty acids determined by GC were influenced by bronopol. Provided preserved samples are subsequently <b>frozen,</b> <b>milk</b> treated with bronopol can reliably be used to evaluate fatty acid composition in most cases; however bronopol might influence a few long-chain fatty acids present in relatively low concentrations. This is one small step towards simplifying milk compositional analysis but it could ultimately streamline the inclusion of milk fat quality into breeding indices, either with a view to 'healthier' milk or potentially reducing methane output and the environmental impact of dairy production...|$|E
