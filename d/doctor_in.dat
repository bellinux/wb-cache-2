40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the roles of}} <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> Maupassant's novel Mont-Oriol. In 19 th century France, natural hot springs {{and the practice of}} medicine were inextricably linked. During this unique period, as described in Maupassant's Mont-Oriol, many <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> France treated their patients in spas and natural hot springs. In Part One, the <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> this context were dedicated to their patient's health initially; however they ultimately became more interested in material pursuits. In Part Two, the roles of doctors appeared to change somewhat. While <b>doctors,</b> <b>in</b> general, still seemed to place a great emphasis on making money, two of the main characters who were doctors, began to develop their religious faiths and pursue love interests. At this stage, the drama which involves the doctors' lives becomes somewhat of a parody. The doctors behave very hypocritically and have little regard for their patients. Through Maupassant's humorous descriptions, readers of Mont-Oriol can gain a satirical look at what life may have been like for <b>doctors</b> <b>in</b> 19 th century France...|$|R
