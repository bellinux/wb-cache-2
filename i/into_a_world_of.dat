She was the granddaughter of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who had founded N M Rothschild & Sons, the English branch of the Rothschilds' banking empire. Niall Ferguson states in his History of the House of Rothschild that by the mid-19th century the Rothschilds {{regarded}} themselves as the nearest thing the Jews of Europe had to a royal family, and the equals of royalty. Whether or not this was strictly true, the many Rothschild homes and their art collections, in England, Austria, France and Germany, certainly rivalled those of the crowned heads of Europe.|$|E

25|$|While the {{conservative}} Ethiopian aristocracy was generally supportive of Zewditu, {{it was less}} enthusiastic about many of her relatives. Zewditu's stepmother and the aunt of her husband, Dowager Empress Taytu Betul, had withdrawn from the capital after Menelik's death, but was still distrusted somewhat due to the evident favorism she had practiced {{during the reign of}} her late husband. In an attempt to limit her influence, the aristocracy arranged for her nephew—Zewditu's husband Ras Gugsa Welle—to be appointed to a remote governorship, removing him from court. This move, while intended as a strike against Taytu rather than against Zewditu, is believed to have upset Zewditu considerably. Zewditu also suffered guilt for taking the throne from Lij Iyasu, whom her father had wanted to succeed him – while she believed that Iyasu's overthrow was necessary, she had admired her father greatly, and was unhappy at having to disobey his wishes. Her separation from her husband and her guilt about Iyasu's overthrow combined to make Zewditu not particularly happy as Empress. Interestingly, even though he had treated her abominably, she held much personal affection for her nephew Iyasu, and is said to have wept bitterly for him when told that she was being made Empress as her nephew had been excommunicated for apostasy. Increasingly, the Empress retreated from state responsibility <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> fasting and prayer, whilst the progressive elements that surrounded the heir, Tafari Makonnen, gained in strength and influence at court.|$|E

500|$|He {{tried to}} find support among psychoanalysts in the UK {{so that he could}} settle there, and was interviewed in London by Ernest Jones, Melanie Klein, Joan Riviere and James Strachey. They decided that he had been [...] "insufficiently analysed" [...] and had an {{unresolved}} hostility toward Freud. Anna Freud, Freud's daughter– whom Jones had contacted about Reich's desire to relocate to England– wrote in 1938: [...] "There is a wall somewhere where he stops to understand the other person's point of view and flies off <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> his own...

He misses his target and is marked for death—then descends <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and paranoia. Shishido {{has been called the}} face of Suzuki's films, owing in part to their frequent collaborations, this being among the most prominent.

500|$|In 1939 the English {{composer}} Gerald Finzi (1901–1956) completed {{writing a}} cantata for solo voice (typically a soprano or tenor soloist) and string orchestra entitled Dies natalis (his Opus number 8) of which four movements are settings of writings by Thomas Traherne: [...] "The Rapture", [...] "Wonder", [...] "The Salutation" [...] and (the only prose piece among the four) an extract from Centuries of Meditations. In {{each of these}} pieces, the text chosen by Finzi reflects the joy and wonder of a newborn child's innocent perspective on {{the world and the}} wonderment in being born <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> such beauty. The first performance of the cantata was delayed until 1946 because of the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández commented in {{his book}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds that to him the song felt like a trepiditation of Madonna's {{thoughts}} about what might be termed [...] "girlhood" [...] and on a broadscale, on [...] "feminity". Christopher P. Andersen, author of Madonna: Unauthorized, described [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants", adding that [...] "the song harkens back to the lullabies your mother must have sang to you". Robin Anne Reid, author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews, complimented the fact that [...] "although the sort of fantasies that [...] conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual, she can also delve <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> mermaids, fountains of youth, leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by 'Dear Jessie'." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurt Loder of Reason {{magazine}} called the film [...] "wonderfully creepy", and wrote that [...] "it's not entirely satisfying; but it's infused with the director's usual creative brio, {{and it has}} a great dark gleaming look." [...] Mike Goodridge from Screen Daily called Black Swan [...] "alternately disturbing and exhilarating" [...] and described the film as a hybrid of The Turning Point and Polanski's films Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Goodridge described Portman's performance, [...] " [...] is captivating as Nina ... she captures the confusion of a repressed young woman thrown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> danger and temptation with frightening veracity." [...] The critic also commended Cassel, Kunis, and Hershey in their supporting roles, particularly comparing Hershey to Ruth Gordon in the role of [...] "the desperate, jealous mother". Goodridge praised Libatique's cinematography with the dance scenes and the psychologically [...] "unnerving" [...] scenes: [...] "It's a mesmerising psychological ride that builds to a gloriously theatrical tragic finale as Nina attempts to deliver the perfect performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Juster had {{not read}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{when he wrote}} The Phantom Tollbooth, but the two books, each about a bored child plunged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> absurd logic, have {{repeatedly}} been compared. According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, [...] "Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin". Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the Cheshire Cat. The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the Queen of Hearts' arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift. Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of Victorian childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); {{a child of the}} post-World War II world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm. His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well—Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll leaves us uncertain if Alice has learned anything from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.|$|E

500|$|In 1943 Vaughan Williams {{conducted}} {{the premiere of}} his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was [...] "like {{the work of a}} distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, Thanksgiving for Victory, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer's characteristic avoidance of [...] "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as [...] "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a [...] "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> aggression and impending chaos." [...] Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: [...] "It never seems to occur to people that a man might just want to write a piece of music." ...|$|E
500|$|The G2 was {{considered}} by critics to be well-built, but {{was criticized for}} replacing the glass-based construction of the Optimus G with a plainer, plastic-based design, drawing comparisons to recent Samsung products. Ars Technica further criticized the Verizon Wireless version for having a cheaper appearance than the international versions, with a plainer rear cover, modified buttons, and a different speaker layout. The G2's rear buttons were met with equally mixed reception, with most reviewers believing that users {{would be able to}} adjust themselves to operate them. Accordingly, the ability to wake the phone by tapping on the screen {{was considered}} a more convenient method. The G2 was praised for its high-end hardware, with Engadget describing the device as a [...] "beast" [...] with specifications that [...] "seem familiar to anyone who's read a flagship Android phone review in the last 12 months", recognizing that it had become harder for manufacturers to differentiate their flagship products beyond displays and processors. The G2's display was praised for its high resolution and color accuracy, along with LG's efforts to reduce the screen bezel size. The G2 was also praised for having unexpectedly longer battery life than any of its competitors (along with Motorola's Droid Razr Maxx). After lasting about 20 hours of [...] "standard" [...] use in its testing, the G2's battery was considered by Engadget to be [...] "a sign that we're finally crossing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sensible smartphone batteries." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{examples}} of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as [...] Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'.
