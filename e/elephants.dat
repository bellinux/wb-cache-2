5|$|<b>Elephants</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the culture of the state. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of <b>elephants</b> in India—about 700 Indian <b>elephants,</b> owned by temples as well as individuals. These <b>elephants</b> are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated <b>elephants</b> during them. In Malayalam literature, <b>elephants</b> are referred to as the 'sons of the sahya. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.|$|E
5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian <b>elephants</b> {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some cases have affected newborns or adult <b>elephants</b> born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded cases have affected African <b>elephants.</b> The first documented fatal case for African <b>elephants</b> was Kijana, an eleven-month-old male in 1996. Since 2008, a number of cases have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian <b>elephants.</b>|$|E
5|$|African <b>elephants</b> {{are listed}} as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild <b>elephants</b> include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. <b>Elephants</b> are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. <b>Elephants</b> are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E

5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian <b>elephants</b> during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of <b>elephants</b> further south in Nubia. From then on, war <b>elephants</b> were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used <b>elephants</b> in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took <b>elephants</b> across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E
5|$|All <b>elephants</b> {{have several}} {{distinctive}} features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African <b>elephants</b> have larger ears and concave backs while Asian <b>elephants</b> have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, <b>elephants</b> {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are {{considered}} keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, <b>elephants</b> excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. <b>Elephants</b> are important seed dispersers; African forest <b>elephants</b> ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like <b>elephants</b> and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food <b>elephants</b> eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. <b>Elephants</b> can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of <b>elephants</b> has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E

5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian <b>elephants.</b> This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African <b>elephants</b> (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian <b>elephants</b> within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead {{have been identified in}} African <b>elephants.</b> A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian <b>elephants</b> in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E
5|$|EEHV2 {{has caused}} hemorrhagic disease in several African <b>elephants</b> as {{reported}} by. Along with EEHV3 and EEHV6 {{it has also}} been found in pulmonary lymph nodes of several autopsied wild and zoo African <b>elephants.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Elephants</b> can exhibit {{bouts of}} {{aggressive}} behaviour {{and engage in}} destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent <b>elephants</b> damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male <b>elephants</b> regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. <b>Elephants</b> killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|<b>Elephants</b> {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in <b>elephants.</b> Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as <b>elephants.</b> During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, <b>elephants</b> have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all <b>elephants,</b> represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. <b>Elephants</b> were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elephants</b> {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between <b>elephants</b> and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other <b>elephants</b> in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan <b>elephants</b> went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult <b>elephants</b> makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult <b>elephants</b> falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile <b>elephants</b> during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. <b>Elephants</b> appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. <b>Elephants</b> tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elephants</b> were {{historically}} {{kept for}} {{display in the}} menageries of Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, <b>elephants</b> have traditionally been {{a major part of}} zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian <b>elephants</b> were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African <b>elephants</b> in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African <b>elephants</b> from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African <b>elephants</b> were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African <b>elephants.</b> About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{listed the}} Asian {{elephant}} as endangered {{due to a}} 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian <b>elephants</b> once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian <b>elephants</b> is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian <b>elephants</b> {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian <b>elephants</b> are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.|$|E
5|$|In Eritrea, {{the olive}} baboon {{has formed a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with that country's endangered elephant population. The baboons use the water holes dug by the <b>elephants,</b> while the <b>elephants</b> use the tree-top baboons as an early warning system.|$|E
5|$|In both Myanmar and Thailand, {{deforestation}} {{and other}} economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed <b>elephants</b> resulting in health problems for the <b>elephants</b> themselves {{as well as economic}} and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.|$|E
5000|$|The Syrian <b>elephant</b> (E. m. asurus), the westernmost and {{the largest}} {{subspecies}} of the Asian <b>elephant,</b> became extinct around 100 BC.

5|$|Keeping <b>elephants</b> in zoos has {{met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer {{researchers}} {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. <b>Elephants</b> have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. <b>Elephants</b> in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo <b>elephants</b> live as long those in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Local {{people have}} {{reported}} {{their belief that}} some <b>elephants</b> were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation. Purportedly drunk <b>elephants</b> attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002, killing six people, {{which led to the}} killing of about 200 <b>elephants</b> by locals.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} references to war <b>elephants</b> is in the Indian epic Mahabharata (written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the Pandavas or Kauravas. During the Magadha Kingdom (which began in the 6th century BC), <b>elephants</b> began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war <b>elephants</b> extensively; 3,000 of them {{were used in the}} Nandas (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the Mauryan army (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The Arthashastra (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild <b>elephants</b> for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them. From South Asia, the use of <b>elephants</b> in warfare spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians used them during the Achaemenid Empire (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC) while Southeast Asian states first used war <b>elephants</b> possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.|$|E
