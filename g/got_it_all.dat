5|$|And by {{the time}} they <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. {{for a couple of days}} and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{roles of}} women in a Puritan society were to be wives and mothers, and provide the family with their {{everyday}} needs. Women were expected to make the clothing for the family, cook the meals, keep the household clean, and teach the children how to live a Puritan lifestyle. All of these tasks alone could keep a woman busy, yet they <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> done, and still would serve their husbands when they arrived home from work. With this being said, Puritan women were hard workers in everything they did.|$|E

Noted for using synthesizers, electric pianos, samplers, and drum machines in his music, musician and frequent OutKast-collaborator Sleepy Brown contributed with production as a member of Organized Noize and with vocals to several tracks. Big Boi has {{said that he}} incorporated various musical elements to the album, with [...] "something from every genre, every funk, beat, loop, horn, whistle. We <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> on the record". He has described Sir Lucious Left Foot as [...] "a funk-filled extravaganza! You know, layers and layers of funk with raw lyrics and a lotta honesty".|$|E

500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length. It also praised {{the sound and}} graphics, though the latter {{was a source of}} criticism: [...] "Incomings <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all...</b> but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt." [...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Spielberg told {{film critic}} Joe Leydon that [...] "People pretend {{to think they}} know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". [...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal beat Charlton Athletic {{in early}} October {{to extend their}} unbeaten run to 48 league matches. Charlton manager Alan Curbishley said of his opponents: [...] "The gulf between Arsenal {{and the rest of}} the Premier League means that the rest have <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> to do to try and stop them, and I'm {{including}} the big three or four." [...] Two goals from Pirès and one from Henry ensured a 3–1 win against Aston Villa, who had led the game early on. Attention soon turned to Arsenal's trip to face Manchester United. The champions were looking to go half a century of league games unbeaten, whereas the home team – in transition, attempted to push on for a title challenge. In the match, a challenge by Sol Campbell on Wayne Rooney earned Manchester United a penalty, converted by Ruud van Nistelrooy in the 73rd minute. Rooney then scored United's second goal of the match to end Arsenal's unbeaten run on 49 games. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel, where pizza was thrown at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. When speaking to the media, a distraught Wenger told reporters that Rooney dived to win the penalty and criticised the refereeing performance of Mike Riley. He was later found guilty of insinuating that Van Nistelrooy was a cheat, and fined £15,000 by the FA.|$|E

He supported himself by doing odd jobs and used an unpaid appointment at Illinois Benedictine College to solicit donations for the project. [...] "I know that sounds odd to most people, but I just never bought into the money system all that much. I never spent <b>it</b> when I <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>all</b> a matter of perspective".

500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand. The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have just held up [...] hands and said 'I <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> wrong, I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
