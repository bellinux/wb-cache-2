5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance reform was not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans <b>did</b> <b>make</b> additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E

5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón {{has often been}} {{credited}} with gaining {{the right to vote}} for Argentine women. While Eva <b>did</b> <b>make</b> radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse <b>did</b> <b>make</b> several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it <b>did</b> <b>make</b> money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is an echo of Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming <b>did</b> <b>make</b> mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that <b>did</b> <b>make</b> the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian <b>did</b> <b>make</b> concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|Over the Rainbow is {{the debut}} {{album of the}} child singer Connie Talbot, and was {{released}} 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. Talbot, who had entered the public eye after her appearance on the first series of Britain's Got Talent at age six, signed with Rainbow, an independent label, after briefly recording with Sony BMG. Over the Rainbow consists entirely of covers of pop and Christmas songs, and was recorded primarily in a spare {{room in the house}} of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt not to interrupt Talbot's childhood by disrupting her regular activities. Although public appearances were initially kept to a minimum, Talbot <b>did</b> <b>make</b> appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release.|$|E
5|$|Pettibone methodically progressed {{through the}} Phillies' farm system, {{generally}} spending about one season {{at each level}} until 2012, when he advanced to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after spending {{a majority of the}} season with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils. Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not use him {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, and he <b>did</b> <b>make</b> two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although he <b>did</b> <b>make</b> an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E

5|$|The ODI {{between the}} World XI and Asian XI {{ended in a}} World XI victory by 112runs. Ricky Ponting, captaining the side, scored 115 as the World XI batted first and scored 344/8, with Chris Cairns and Brian Lara both scoring half centuries. The Asian XI was unable to reach 345 for victory but <b>did</b> <b>make</b> 232 from their innings. For every run scored in the match, $1,000 was donated to the tsunami appeal. Over 70,000 people {{attended}} the match which was televised in 122countries. The endeavour raised over A$14million. A second fund-raising match between the two teams was cancelled due to unsuitable playing conditions.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element <b>did</b> <b>make</b> it into the series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives {{as part of his}} pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro was {{completed}} on 31 March 1917 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War I.

Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she <b>did</b> <b>make</b> a port visit to Port Arthur, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{memorial}} began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston. The South Australian Monumental Works {{were chosen to}} work on the construction, with Alan Tillett as the principal. Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal, it <b>did</b> <b>make</b> mention of a possible candidate—who later proved to be Rayner Hoff, a Sydney-based sculptor born in England. Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio, with the bronze castings from Hoff's plaster models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company. (Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of the required size, but a test casting of the lion's head from {{the memorial}} was sufficient to overcome his concerns). The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff's designs, expressed through one-third sized plaster models which Henschke then scaled to suit.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian <b>did</b> <b>make</b> concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012–13 season, Palace {{achieved}} {{promotion to}} the Premier League via the Championship play-offs after finishing fifth.O'Keefe featured just {{five times in}} the league during the season although he <b>did</b> <b>make</b> two appearances during the play-offs, replacing Wilfried Zaha as a late substitute during the second leg of their semi-final victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, and then playing {{the majority of the}} 2013 Championship play-off Final after replacing Kagisho Dikgacoi due to injury after just 17 minutes as Palace claimed a 1–0 victory in extra-time to earn promotion. At the start of the club's Premier League campaign the following season, on 31 August 2013, O'Keefe sealed a 3–1 victory in Palace's first three points of their Premier League return in the 92nd minute at home to Sunderland with a curling 20 yard shot after coming on as a late substitute, the first senior goal of his career and what later turned out to be his only goal for Palace.|$|E
