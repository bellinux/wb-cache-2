30|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> method, <b>called</b> the risk-based security-constrained economic dispatch (RB-SCED), and explores its application in power systems. The work {{is an extension of}} previous works [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. In the rest of this paper, we introduce the basic concept and mathematical formulation of RB-SCED model, and test the model in two systems to illustrate the benefits of RB-SCED over SCED.|$|R
40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} and solved which captures {{the essence of the}} concept <b>of</b> mobile <b>dispatch</b> service. There are two types <b>of</b> users, <b>dispatch</b> and interconnect (calls routed from the public switched telephone network, of much longer holding times). Also, only some of the available repeaters can be used for interconnect traffic, and blocked interconnect calls are cleared. Dispatch calls, however, can access all repeaters, and then are queued if all repeaters are busy. One design decision involves a trade between blocking <b>of</b> interconnect <b>calls</b> and queueing <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> <b>calls.</b> A formula has been derived for both interconnect blocking probability and the mean dispatch queueing time to permit this trade. The results indicate that a good operating point is to have (N - a_d) (rounded down) interconnected repeaters, where there are N total repeaters and a_d Erlangs <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> traffic...|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{methods are}} {{recognized}} as a very useful tool for reusing code and augmenting the expressiveness of an object-oriented language providing parametric classes. This paper focuses on their implementation techniques for Java. Existing proposals for extending Java with parametric polymorphism are outlined, showing and discussing the basic implementation techniques: type-erasure, code-expansion and type-passing. Up until now, only type-erasure and code-expansion have been exploited {{for the implementation of}} parametric methods, but they suffer from some problems. Basically, type-erasure is unable to support parametric types at run-time, while code-expansion generally leads to significant increase of both disk and memory overhead. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} study a type-passing approach aimed at tackling these issues. This is based on the management of method descriptors, which are objects passed to the method bodies at invocation-time, and which carry information on the instantiation of the method’s type parameters. Run-time efficiency is guaranteed thanks to a special treatment of descriptors deferring their creation at load-time. Dynamic <b>dispatching</b> <b>of</b> method <b>calls</b> is supported by exploiting a data structure called the Virtual Parametric Methods Table, resembling Virtual Methods Tables of C++. The approach here presented turns out to be a significant alternative to the existing proposal...|$|R

40|$|Object-oriented {{languages}} make predicting types at compile time very difficult. In {{order to}} avoid the expensive virtual method <b>dispatch,</b> a variety <b>of</b> <b>call</b> graph construction algorithms have been researched. Such information would also be helpful if applied to duck-typed languages [...] languages for which the variables are bound to types when they are assigned a value. In these languages, it is not even obvious to the programmer if calling a method will work, and any extra information that can be gleaned by the compiler would be helpful. In this paper, we summarize the existing work on type inference. We then implement the Cartesian Product Algorithm, applying it to zscript, a simple java-like object-oriented language with ducktypes. Because CPA was designed for self, language without variables, we make several additions and discuss the results. The efficiency of our implementation is analyzed using automatically generated programs, and possible future enhancements are discussed. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police <b>dispatch</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>call</b> {{and again in the}} middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end <b>of</b> the two-minute <b>call,</b> the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|R

Hydrothermal scheduling is performed {{in order to}} find the optimum allocation of hydro energy so that the annual operating cost of a mixed hydro-thermal system is minimized. In the present work the hydrothermal scheduling problem is decomposed into three subproblems: maintenance <b>of</b> thermal units, <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> thermal units, and <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> hydro units. The algorithm takes into consideration the stochastic nature of the water inflows to the reservoir and the forced outage rates of the thermal units. Maintenance scheduling is performed based on the levelized risk criterion, <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> the thermal units is determined based on probabilistic techniques, while the <b>dispatch</b> <b>of</b> the hydro units is formulated as a constrained optimization problem.
