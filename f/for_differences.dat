5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

40|$|Description This package calculates the Confidence Interval (CI) {{for single}} {{binomial}} proportion, CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> of two binomial proportions, and CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> of difference. There are 4 major functions available: singleCI(k,n) gives the CI for binomial proportion given (k,n), pdiff(k 1,n 1,k 2,n 2, d) gives {{the probability that}} the difference of p 1 from p 2 is greater than d, and pdiffCI(k 1,n 1, k 2,n 2) gives the CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> of two binomial proportions given (k 1,n 1, k 2, n 2). numCI(k 1,n 1, k 2,n 2, K 1, N 1,K 2,N 2) gives the CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> of difference (p 1 -p 2) - (P 1 -P 2).
