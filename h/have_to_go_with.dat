After giving up 128.4 rushing {{yards a game}} in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any, you’d <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said. Cody was subsequently given the team’s Defensive Achievement Award for a newcomer who has {{played a critical role}} in the effectiveness of his unit.|$|E

Because everybody's got an opinion, {{and so many}} people's {{opinions}} about me are like polar opposites. They're like, 'We love it when she does ballads, make her do the ballads.' Then they're like, 'We {{want to hear a}} hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean? I'm like, 'Stay in your lane, and I'll figure it out.' ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wind It Up", the album's lead single, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics {{for its use}} of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, peaking inside the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track was well received and was a major success, reaching the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; [...] "4 in the Morning", [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] which featured Damian Marley and [...] "Early Winter". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated {{that she had no}} plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, [...] "That was a moment in time... It went on a little longer than we all thought it would, because it was inspired and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> wherever you're at in that time in your life... But everything works out how it should." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E
500|$|The band {{entered the}} studio {{with most of the}} songs {{finished}} and rehearsed; producer Nick Raskulinecz, who also worked on One by One, stated that while [...] "One By One was very loose, [...] "In Your Honor was more planned out. Dave was more meticulous on that one". The electric album was done in segments by instrument, starting with the drums and guitars, then vocals, and finally bass. Mendel would write a bass line on Pro Tools at home before showing it to Grohl and Raskulinecz. The bass was recorded after the vocals, which Raskulinecz said was done because [...] "By doing bass last, you can really tailor it for tuning, parts and sound. If you do the drums and then the guitars, you can fill the hole that's left with bass. And sometimes that hole wants a certain frequency that isn't traditional for bass, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it, which is even more fun." [...] During the last three weeks of work in the rock songs, the band was in the studio [...] "from noon to eight in the morning, making the rock record the most devastating thing we've ever done". After two months working with the rock songs, the band was approaching their established deadline and had a meeting where they decided that to finish the album [...] "Everyone has to be here all day, we need to do one song a day and no one's leaving until that song is done." [...] Grohl would listen to a click track, and [...] "we'd find a tempo and I'd just roll an arrangement {{off the top of my}} head." [...] As the bandmembers recorded their parts, Grohl would write the lyrics. The rushed approach prevented Mendel from writing bass lines, so he ended up [...] "concentrating on just finding the notes and getting the rhythm right." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that a multiformat points {{system would be}} used for England's summer series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The points system would be the same as the system used in the 2015 Women's Ashes series, with four points being awarded for winning a Test match, and two points being awarded for winning a One Day International or Twenty20 International. The winning team under the points system will be awarded £25,000. Director of England Cricket Andrew Strauss, who announced the new points system, said that [...] "We're trying to create more context to every game that's played." [...] Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews was opposed to the points system, saying [...] "I don’t like {{to move away from the}} traditional game but whatever the administrators decide we’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> and move on", whilst former England captain Michael Vaughan called the new system [...] "nonsense". Former Australian bowler Jason Gillespie said that the points system was worth a trial, as it had been successful in The Women's Ashes.|$|E
