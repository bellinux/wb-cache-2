5|$|At {{least one}} {{explosive}} subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous volcano, known as White Horse Bluff, {{is thought to}} have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by <b>glacial</b> ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The volcano heated <b>glacial</b> water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments. Once the steam explosions had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the <b>glacial</b> water, creating the unvolcano-like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite. The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the <b>glacial</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} Glacier Bay existed during {{a minimum of}} four <b>Glacial</b> periods ending with the Little Ice Age, which has a 4,000-year-old record, as the latest period. All glaciers in the park today {{are said to be}} {{remnants}} of this <b>glacial</b> period.|$|E

5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying <b>glacial</b> ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by <b>glacial</b> ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying <b>glacial</b> ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the <b>glacial</b> ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within <b>glacial</b> ice.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and <b>glacial</b> lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The <b>glacial</b> deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other <b>glacial</b> landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained <b>glacial</b> deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E
5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold <b>glacial</b> periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during <b>glacial</b> periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the <b>glacial</b> periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
50|$|The <b>glacials</b> in the {{following}} tables show historical usages, are a simplification of a much more complex cycle of variation in climate and terrain, and are generally no longer used. These names have been abandoned in favor of numeric data {{because many of the}} correlations were found to be either inexact or incorrect and more than four major <b>glacials</b> have been recognized since the historical terminology was established.|$|R
40|$|Palynological {{records from}} the Congo fan reveal {{environmental}} change in equatorial Africa occurring 1. 05 Ma ago, 100 k. y. before the mid-Pleistocene climatic shift at 0. 9 Ma. Prior to 1. 05 Ma, a glacial-interglacial rhythm is not obvious in the African vegetation variation. Afterwards, Podocarpus spread {{in the mountains of}} central Africa mainly during <b>glacials</b> and Congo River discharge decreased. The sequence of vegetation variation associated with the mid-Pleistocene <b>glacials</b> and interglacials differed from that observed during the late Pleistocene. Between 0. 9 and 0. 6 Ma, interglacials were characterized by warm dry conditions and <b>glacials</b> were characterized by cool humid conditions, while during the past 0. 2 Ma <b>glacials</b> were cold and dry and interglacials warm and humid. Our data indicate that before the Northern Hemisphere ice caps dramatically increased in size (0. 9 ? 0. 6 Ma), low-latitude climate forcing and response in the tropics {{played an important role in}} the initiation of 100 k. y. ice-age cycles. During the mid to late Pleistocene, however, the climate conditions in the tropics were increasingly influenced by the glacial-interglacial variations of continental ice sheets...|$|R
40|$|Al/Ti and K/Al ratios in bulk {{sediment}} {{are used}} to interpret wind-blown and hemipelagic sources of deposition to a 578 kyr record in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela (Ocean Drilling Program site 1002). Graphical and cross-spectral analyses indicate that these ratios vary extremely closely with planktonic foraminiferal d 18 O, with both ratios being significantly higher during interglacials and lower during <b>glacials.</b> K/Al indicates that during <b>glacials</b> the lower sea level that results in relative basin isolation increases the relative proportion of kaolinite derived from local rivers draining the relatively humid Venezuelan margin. Al/Ti decreases during <b>glacials,</b> suggesting greater proportions of eolian rutile sourced from the northern Sahara (due to increased wind strength and/or aridity). This interpretation {{is consistent with previous}} studies of the chemistry and mineralogy of Saharan-derived eolian matter in the Caribbean and with a mass balance determining the effect of changes in eolian rutile accumulation on the bulk sedimentary Al/Ti ratio...|$|R
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the <b>glacial</b> history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last <b>glacial</b> maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from <b>glacial</b> meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete <b>glacial</b> melting {{would have had}} to occur in less than about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, some smaller lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from <b>glacial</b> meltwater alone. The lake may have contributed to increased precipitation by influencing land breezes. According to strontium isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poop√≥ basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary <b>glacial</b> cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last <b>Glacial</b> Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after <b>glacial</b> retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E
40|$|Changeover between <b>glacials</b> and {{interglacial period}} singificantly affects species {{distribution}} for hundreds thousands years. Along {{with the traditional}} conception species distribution was restricted to refugia in southern Europe during <b>glacials,</b> Mediterrain, from where they recolonized northern parts of ranges after deglaciation. However, according to new findings many species could have had refugia to the north from this classical refugia, in central Europe. Northern refugia were often located in proximity of mountain systems or in rock massifs. Some species are, however, so adaptable that their dispersal was continuous even during ice ages to the north from southern refugia {{and they were able}} to live in cold regions. Even cold-adapted species contract to refugia, but instead of <b>glacials</b> their distribution is restricted during interglacial periods. Their ranges either contract to the north of Europe or undergo altitudinal shifts. Species can have refugia also in accordance with the gradient of oceanic-continental climate. In above mentioned types of refugia, complicated demographic processed connected with decreasing population size could take place, often resulting in speciation process...|$|R

5|$|By 1910, most <b>glacial</b> {{acetic acid}} was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of <b>glacial</b> acetic acid, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} <b>glacial</b> period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have {{extended}} {{south of the}} Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this {{could be due to}} the rising sea levels‚Äîolder sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. Alternately, the sea mink may have evolved after the last <b>glacial</b> period and filled a new ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glacial</b> {{debris and}} ice were {{probably}} {{present at the}} lake, with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their maximum size shortly before the lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began.

40|$|A c. 50 m {{thick section}} {{located in the}} Crotone Basin (southern Italy) was {{investigated}} using oxygen isotopes, pollen and planktonic foraminifera. The section records two complete transgressive-regressive cycles mainly driven by glacio-eustasy. Biostratigraphy and oxygen isotope chronology indicate that the section spans from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 22 (c. 0. 87 Ma) to MIS 18. 3 (c. 0. 73 Ma), thus straddling the Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) boundary which occurs {{in the middle of}} MIS 19. The rich pollen assemblages provide a unique record of the vegetation in the central Mediterranean during the Early-Middle Pleistocene climatic transition. Interglacials are characterized by a mesothermic vegetation similar to the present day, whereas a rain-demanding conifer forest dominates the <b>glacials</b> of MIS 20 and MIS 18. This is unexpected because it is generally considered that during the Pleistocene, <b>glacials</b> in central Mediterranean were characterized by steppe (arid) conditions. By contrast, arid conditions occur during the deglaciations. These results are inconsistent with the widespread practice of linking <b>glacials</b> with arid conditions in the central Mediterranean during Pliocene and Early Pleistocene times. This study emphasizes the need to establish more accurate land-sea correlation...|$|R
40|$|The biogenic-related {{elements}} Ca, Sr, Ba, P, Cd, scavenged Al, and Ti {{were analyzed}} by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) for Core NS 93 - 5 from the west slope of the South China Sea. Terrestrial input as estimated from the accumulation of Ti was higher during <b>glacials</b> than during interglacials. Carbonate accumulation rates are inversely related to those of terrestrial input, suggesting higher production of calcareous phytoplankton during interglacials. The accumulation patterns of authigenic Sr, Ba, P, and Cd match that of carbonate, further indicating higher calcareous phytoplankton production during interglacials. Scavenged Al and excess SiO 2, which is related to biogenic opal, exhibit higher accumulation rates during <b>glacials</b> and correspond with changes in terrestrial input. This indicates that terrestrial input driven is important to siliceous phytoplankton production but not for calcareous phytoplankton production. As calcareous phytoplankton is the dominant component of the biogenic sediments in the South China Sea, particularly during interglacials, previous inference of higher productivity in the South China Sea during <b>glacials</b> based on only the biogenic opal proxy needs to be reconsidered...|$|R
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged {{the landscape of the}} state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of <b>glacial</b> drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of <b>glacial</b> till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago.
