60|$|The men set cheerfully to work, {{under his}} directions. In his chest was a hatchet, saw, and chisels. With these, young trees of {{flexible}} wood were cut down and split. A keel was laid, 25 feet in length. <b>Cross</b> <b>pieces,</b> 12 feet long, were pegged to this by trenails--nails formed of tough and hard wood. The <b>cross</b> <b>pieces</b> were then bent upwards, and {{fastened to the}} strips which were to form the gunwale. Strengthening pieces were placed along, at distances of 7 or 8 inches apart, and firmly lashed. When the whole was finished, after three days' labor, {{the framework of a}} boat 25 feet long, 3 feet deep, and 7 feet in beam stood upon the beach. A barrel of oil had been thrown ashore and, with this, the mate intended thoroughly to soak the canvas with which the frame was to be covered. The boat would, he calculated, carry the whole of the men, with an ample store of food and water for the voyage.|$|R

A single <b>cross</b> <b>piece,</b> or two <b>cross</b> <b>pieces,</b> or a circle, or a diamond; so that each sand has got its own particular mark. These are known to the masters of all ships that {{go up and down}} the river, and so they can tell exactly where they are, and what course to take. At night they anchor, for there would be no possibility of finding the way up or down in the dark. I have heard tell from mariners who have sailed abroad that there ain't a place anywhere with such dangerous sands as those we have got here {{at the mouth of the}} Thames." ...|$|R
