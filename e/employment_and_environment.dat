The result, Working on Country, is acknowledged as an environmental, employment, and social success. By September 2013, nearly 700 rangers in 90 projects cared for 1. 5 million square kilometres of country. Theoretical understanding of ?policy success? is recognised as an embryonic field within public policy theory. Working on Country provides a fertile case to investigate ?policy success?. Interviews with federal environment departmental officials show that, in the particular case of Working on Country, keys to policy success were the lengthy evolution and ?road testing? of the program concept, authentic stakeholder engagement, and subsuming the environment objectives.

40|$|Das Problem der Arbeitslosigkeit ist in den letzten zehn Jahren nicht nur in der Bundesrepublik, sondern auch auf der europaeischen Ebene auf den ersten Platz der politischen Agenda gerueckt. Das Weissbuch der Europaeischen Kommission zu 'Wachstum, Wettbewerbsfaehigkeit, Beschaeftigung' von 1993 ist Ausdruck dieser Prioritaetensetzung, die dadurch umgesetzt werden soll, dass den Beschaeftigungseffekten von Massnahmen in allen Politikfeldern erhoehte Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wird. Neben Politikfeldern wie Forschung und Technologieentwicklung wird in diesem Programm die Umweltpolitik besonders hervorgehoben. Nachdem laengere Zeit Investitionen in Umwelt ueberwiegend unter dem Aspekt der Gefaehrdung von Wettbewerbsfaehigkeit und Beschaeftigung gesehen wurden, sind in den neunziger Jahren zunehmend die Beschaeftigungspotentiale einer umweltpolitischen Wende z. B. in der Energiewirtschaft in die Diskussion gebracht worden. Fuer die Promotoren einer aktiven, integrierten Umweltpolitik bestand hierin die Chance, das inzwischen nachlassende Gewicht oekologischer Kritierien bei wirtschaftlichen Entscheidungen durch eine Ankopplung an soziale Krisenloesungen zu kompensieren. Es entstand das Bild einer 'doppelten Dividende', die durch die Kombination beschaeftigungspolitischer und umweltpolitischer Effekte in einer Massnahme zu erzielen sei. Das Discussion paper, in dem die Beitraege einer Tagung des europaeischen Netzwerks 'Industrial Relations and Environment in Europe' von 1996 zusammenstellt sind, behandelt diese Option aus der Sicht einer 'oekologisch erweiterten Arbeitspolitik' auf europaeischer Ebene. Es werden Beitraege aus der Arbeitsmarktforschung, aus der europaeischen Politikberatung und aus nationalen Kontexten zusammengefuehrt, die versuchen, die quantitativen Potentiale dieses neuen Arbeitsmarktsegments abzuschaetzen und ihre politischen Voraussetzungen und arbeitspolitischen Implikationen zu beleuchten.

The 1993 White Book of the European Commission on 'Growth, Competitiveness, Employment' stresses this priority which shall be realised through giving higher attention to the employment effects of measures in all political areas. Besides policy fields like research and technology development, especially environment policy is emphasised in this programme. Since for a longer period of time investments in the environment have mainly been considered as a danger for competitiveness and employment, during the 1990 s the employment potentials of a change in environmental policy (e. g. in energy) increasingly came into discussion. The promoters of an active, integrated environment policy saw the opportunity to compensate the decreasing importance of ecological criteria for economic decisions through a connection to social-crisis solutions. The feature of a 'double dividend' came into existence, that should be created by a combination of employment policy and environment policy measures. This discussion paper presents the contributions to a conference organised by the European Network 'Industrial Relations and Environment in Europe' in 1996. It discusses the perspective of a double dividend from the viewpoint of an 'ecologically extended labour policy' at a European level. Contributions from the labour market policy, from the European policy debate and from national research groups are collected in this paper, which try to asses the quantitative potentials of this new labour segment, its political preconditions and its labour-political implications.

40|$|The modal part of road {{transport}} still accounts in France for approximately 80 % among all available transport modes. Even if {{a shift to}} other modes of transport is wished for, this situation {{is not likely to}} change radically in the next coming years. Indeed, the road network has developed over thousands of years: emerging from the track to the paved road, then to the smooth road and on to the continuous road. However, the environmental cost of current road infrastructures is still too important. As a consequence, the development of road infrastructures is not a priority anymore {{and as a matter of}} fact excluded from ambitious greening politics. There is then a need of strong innovation in this sector to solve these issues. The 5 th Generation Road program (R 5 G for French “Route de 5 ème Génération”) aims at changing the image of road infrastructures by designing, constructing and operating full scale demonstrators, which implement innovative solutions, ready for testing in research centres. To consider all aspects of this issue, the program is elaborated though a systemic approach and is organized around four emblematic conceptual elements: the adaptable road, the automated road, the resilient road and the acceptable road. The potential benefits of such a program are numerous: Maintaining the RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety) of road networks at existing levels, reinforcing industrial leaderships and targeting societal objectives (education, <b>employment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment).</b> The coming months will be devoted to the development and the implementation of the program at the National an...|$|E
40|$|Facing the {{hypotheses}} of political-strategic intervention {{derived from the}} «Declarations» of Lisbon (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007) and Gothenburg (2001), countries and regions in the enlarged EU have reacted differently, offering many possible interpretations to the concepts of competitiveness and sustainability, and so reviewing critical literature (Cf. chap. 4). Italian regions and provinces are no exception: the first ones through addresses and policy measures related to Operational and Programming Documents, the second ones through budgets and focused PEG, beyond the general, but not always convincing, adoption of a prospect of change and innovation resulting from the "required" transition towards a competitive knowledge-based economy, in order to generate employment, growth and social cohesion, in respect of the environmental issues. How necessary was a common European economic policy for <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment,</b> and how necessary was to monitor its performance by use of (not only structural) common indicators, are topics which are {{only now beginning to}} discuss. Between 2000 and 2006, the need of «strong reforms» to be brought to sectors traditionally open to competitiveness, coupled with limited financial resources available in the countries after enlargement, pushed the EU to confirm traditional structural directions, side by side with integrated strategies (contrast to unemployment and the widening gap in global trade, education, research and development), concentrating national and regional investments in three fields: networks and quality knowledge; industries and services competitiveness through environmental technologies; contrast to the ageing of the workforce, so to enable them to stay longer in the labour market and thus lower the cost of welfare. A still positive (though slightly so) economic trend between 2004 and 2006 had convinced our country to postpone investments in sustainable public policies aimed at combating climate change, risks to public health, poverty and social exclusion, depletion of natural resources, pollution, traffic congestion and land use. Emergency measures undertaken by the European Commission after 2005 – then followed by the latest anti-crisis initiatives – aimed to granting present and future generations a clear improvement in quality of life, do not affect the spatial (provincial) planning of Italian regions and do not take on the perspective review of Structural Funds and the major policies (including the new PAC). Between 2004 and 2007 the Operational Documents and Programs of many Italian regions, in an attempt to combine simultaneously the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, focused on the interaction of policy choices and concluded that: growth and development are not converging objectives; an overall strategy for regional competitiveness can be effective only if independent from the environmental dimension, assessing the relative territorial scope only in social and economic terms; sustainability on a global scale (climate change, public health, biodiversity, accessibility) implies a change of macro and microeconomic behaviour. Given the results achieved on this subject in Europe (Prezioso, 2007), the research participants were asked to apply, in a practical and operational way, to regions and large provincial areas the experimented methodology for the integration of the Lisbon/Gothenburg strategy, following a precise working method (SteMA), in order to select, among the many policy options provided, the most appropriate according to the reference regional potentials, avoiding diseconomies of congestion and excessive generalizations. These tasks had to be performed with a view to equitable and balanced distribution of regional capital and support of the choices of political coordination in matter of competitiveness and sustainability, defined by the EU with the use of preventive Impact Assessment (Dir.

40|$|Construction {{is one of}} Europe's biggest industries, {{providing}} {{jobs for}} nearly 13 million people. This represents nearly 8 % of the working population in Europe (only the public sector and retail employ more). It {{is also one of}} the most hazardous industries. More construction workers are killed, injured or suffer health impairments than in any other industry, and one of the most critical section in the construction sector is the underground construction. In particular the effect on workers' health is of serious concern. It is difficult to be precise about the true scale of the health problem, but all studies indicate the problem is huge. Every year many thousands of workers suffer from work related diseases. These include musculoskeletal disorders, noise induced hearing loss, skin diseases, and other diseases as a consequence of exposure to noxious substances. Additionally, the economic costs of poor safety and health are vast. One national study estimates that they typically account for up to 8. 5 % of a construction project's costs. The creation of underground space has significant impact on quality of life, working conditions, <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>environment.</b> Innovative use of underground space will have a great impact. European Union policies include an upgrading of the Trans European road network (TREN), in order to improve interstate transport. This implies the construction of a significant number of tunnels (approx. 2100 km of tunnels will have to be constructed in Europe by the year 2030). Underground space will be increasingly used to alleviate pressing problems that will confront the European society in the next 20 years: traffic congestion, increasing urbanization (mega cities), lack of space and pollution of air and water. In Italy, the construction of rail and road tunnels through the Alps and the Apennines is very important in terms of connection and moreover, the requirements of transport systems, for civil use spaces and for innovative service networks is one of the reasons for the increase of underground works in urban areas more densely populated. The hydrogeological, geological, operational and environmental criticalities as met in such geological structures can nevertheless require increased care in the aforesaid situations. Projects under construction have further highlighted the importance of tunnels for the elimination of traditional surface, territorial and environmental constraints, but also for the necessary acquisition of consensus through the most comprehensive analysis and management of risks related to the effective fulfilment of such projects, in order both to meet the needs of the end users, and to preserve the dwellers and environmental safety conditions in terms of correct sustainable development. The most important changes in such a point of view occurred since the end of the last century, and suggest the need of a more effective and comprehensive approach to the concept of infrastructure. For this purpose it is nowadays required a horizontal approach, whereby different disciplines (technical, structural, architectural, environmental, financial and occupational safety) can interact and mutually stimulate in order to face the complex issues of underground works project. For these reasons, the designer's role becomes crucial to develop underground projects that respect a sustainable development approach; designer must know innovative and advanced technologies, materials and procedures, aimed at optimizing the economical, environmental and social development. Even the public client, responsible for government priorities and objectives of the intervention, is fundamental for the orientation of the operational choices of designers and builders of infrastructures. In fact, especially in the last decade, a number of guidelines and recommendations were issued by International, European and Italian authorities, the most effective of them based on the introduction of the prevention in the design phase and on a quality based risk management. The design and construction of underground operations require by the Designer and Contractor/s a decision making based on multiple factors (environmental, technological, etc.) that have specific characteristics and particular criticalities, far more than other industrial contexts, since they are often characterized by considerable uncertainty in their definition during the development of the project. In this context the Designer must identify the best option among several available solutions -which have different implications in terms of technical, operational, environmental and financial risks- while the Contractor/s must make a constant check on the preservation of design conditions, in order to control the validity of work and environmental safety requirements. Furthermore, for maintaining the correct safety conditions, it is of primary importance the application of Hazard Identification Techniques referring to different design solutions, and the definition of suitable confidence limits in order to provide the work manager with suitable instruments to constantly evaluate the yard situation and to avoid the overcoming of the aforesaid limits. The PhD research project has therefore to cover the most common criticalities encountered in tunnelling and underground works projects such as: - the presence of pollutants, and in particular carcinogenic minerals, such as, for example, the crystalline silica, which is recognized class A 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic certain to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer -IARC- since 1997 (and reaffirmed by the same organization in 2011) and the types of fibrous silicate included in the formal definition of asbestos, which there is no discussion on the ascription to the class A 1; - the design and management of the construction yard: the presence of limited working spaces, the high concentration of high power machinery and the use of iterative work cycles, together with reduced time for the excavation, make mandatory the need to plan the interference among concomitant operations in order to prevent accident; - the control of the safety conditions: it is of primary importance the application of Hazard Identification Techniques referring to the choice of suitable confidence limits in order to make available for the work manager the instruments to constantly evaluate the yard situation to avoid the overcoming of the aforesaid limits and referring to the choice of equipment and procedures to minimize accidents at work. Taking into account the best available techniques, the principles of Quality and Prevention through Design approach, the PhD research has also set criteria for the identification and evaluation of the above mentioned criticalities in order to develop an expert system, finalized to make available an integrated system to optimize the economic, environmental and operational safety for the underground works activities in order to proceed rationally to choose the best solutio...|$|E
