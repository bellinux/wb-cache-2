The building is divided into three sections due to the steel trusses being constructed off-site and were put into position. Each section consists of floors that are cantilevered 6 metres from each column, with load transfer girders spanning at each <b>end</b> taking up <b>boxed</b> <b>sections</b> of the pre-stressed concrete. Lattice steel models strengthened by steel and concrete compression was installed on the 20th and 35th floors of the building. The building has been nicknamed the calculator due to its flat shape and windows which look like button pads.|$|R

40|$|Behaviour under torsion is an {{important}} performance-related property of automotive <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> A previous experimental study has identified joining technique, section thickness and section area as the major influencing factors on the torsional behaviour of <b>box</b> hat <b>sections.</b> Using these test results as the basis, a finite element modelling strategy that can simulate the behaviour of adhesively bonded and spot-welded automotive <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to torsion is presented. The numerical study investigated the effects of material representation, mesh density and layout, and joining technique representation on the stiffness, elastic limit and ultimate strength of the <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> The final model, calibrated and validated against test results obtained from previous work, was used in an extensive study, presented in the companion paper (Part 2), to further {{the understanding of the}} behaviour of torsionally loaded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> and its implications on weight reduction of automotive structures...|$|R

In the work presented herein, the torsional properties of T-joints were determined both experimentally and numerically. A factorial-design test programme comparing adhesive-bonded and spot-welded T-joints was carried out. Numerical models, generated using a general-purpose finite element program and validated against the test results, were used to investigate further the behaviour {{of the connection between}} the two <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> in a T-joint. The joining technique and the joint eccentricity at the connection (the distance of the join from the vertical <b>box</b> <b>section)</b> were found to influence the torsional properties of T-joints.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental investigation of a novel FRP-concrete composite floor system. The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> at a variable spacing allow concrete ‘studs’ to form at the grating/box section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> Following component tests on the concrete-filled grating and shear connectors, six (300 x 150) mm and 3000 mm long slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. From the resulting load-deflection curves, {{it was determined that}} all specimens behaved elastically and fully compositely until the initial peak was reached. No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved...|$|R

It was found that a significant increase in torsional stiffness could be achieved by changing the joining technique, increasing the sheet thickness, increasing the section area and, to a lesser extent, changing the section design.

The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to rectangular pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> at a variable spacing allow concrete 'studs' to form at the grating/box interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> Following preliminary component tests on two concrete blocks, experimental {{results show that the}} concrete filled grating provides a 100 % increase in strain capacity when compared to a plain concrete block. It is therefore feasible to provide ductility to the complete system through the concrete in compression. Four push-out GFRP grating-box section specimens were then tested in double shear to assess the shear behaviour of the proposed GFRP dowel shear connector in both partially concrete-filled and fully concrete-filled <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> From the resulting load-slip curves, a progressive longitudinal shear failure was seen to be provided by such a connection.

The novel crack stoppers consist of CFRP and they connect the face sheets.

Two types are investigated, a <b>box</b> <b>section</b> and a double-T beam. Quasi-static and cyclic Single Cantilever Beam (SCB) and Cracked Sandwich Beam (CSB) tests are run to evaluate their crack stop capability under global mode I and global mode II loading. The double-T beam shows the better crack stop effect. In the SCB test the <b>box</b> <b>section</b> increases the specimen durability by less than 2 %, whereas the double-T beam increases the load cycles to failure by a factor of 2. 7 to 447.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} concentrically loaded welded box and com-posite columns fabricated from 690 MPa high strength steel (HSS) and 100 MPa high strength concrete (HSC). Firstly, this thesis investigates the induced residual stress distributions in square welded sections fabricated from HSS plates with sin-gle and multiple weld passes. The non-destructive neutron diﬀraction technique was used to investigate the residual stresses in six test specimens: four specimens fabricated from 5 mm HSS plates using single weld passes, {{and the other two}} spec-imens fabricated from 16 mm HSS plates using six weld passes. Secondly, this thesis investigates the ultimate strength of short and slender welded box (HS) and short and slender composite sections (CB) fabricated from HSS and ﬁlled with HSC. Herein, forty ﬁve short test specimens having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and length to width ratios ranging from 3. 5 to 5 were tested. Furthermore, ﬁfteen slender test specimens (HS) and thirty nine slender test specimens (CB) having width to thickness ratios ranging from 15 to 40 and slenderness ratios ranging from 18 to 124 were tested to failure. Furthermore, ﬁnite element modelling (FEM) of the all test specimens was veri-ﬁed with the experimental results. The FEM was used to investigate the eﬀects of residual stresses induced from lightly and heavily welded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> (HS) on the section and member capacity of welded <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> The column curves of various design speciﬁcations pertaining to slender welded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> were reviewed by the experimental and FEM peak strengths for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate curves for slender <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> having non-compact cross-sections.
