40|$|Embedded {{control systems}} are gaining an {{increasing}} amount of responsibility in today's vehicles and industrial machines. As mechanical components {{are replaced by}} software, the complexity of control systems {{and the amount of}} data they are responsible for greatly increase. Generally there are two approaches to dealing with this huge amount of information, but both have flaws which can reduce system performance, or in the worst case scenario cause fatal system failures with potential to cause loss of human lives. The two approaches are creation of large purpose-built data structures with shared variables, and implementation of a database. The first is often not scalable, becomes tremendously complex, and has high development costs, while the latter has the common downside that many databases are simply too slow. This study will explore the possibilities of using a real-time database to overcome these issues. As part of one of their control systems, CC Systems have developed the Diagnostic Runtime Engine (DRE) which keeps track {{of the state of the}} system. The database currently used in the DRE is too slow and this thesis project aims to replace it with a Mimer SQL Real-time Edition database. This real-time database utilises a unique concept called database pointers to access data in hard real-time. Although the real-time database comes with some issues and limitations of its own, this study shows that most of them can be worked around rather easily. Implementation of the real-time database would allow the DRE to handle incoming signals more than 50 times faster than the demands, as well as heavily decrease the complexity of the DRE's source code. Mimer SQL Real-time Edition works entirely with in-memory copies of database tables, and the tables must be explicitly saved, or flushed, to the disk. In order to optimise the flush we need to know roughly how often we can expect incoming signals, but such information is currently not available. Instead this thesis draws up some important criteria that should be considered when optimising the <b>flush</b> <b>performance.</b> The conclusion of this thesis is that implementation of Mimer SQL Real-time Edition would be beneficial for the Diagnostic Runtime Engine...|$|E
30|$|More {{engineering}} {{work has been}} achieved to optimize toilet flushing system design. An et al. (2012) have investigated toilet <b>flushing</b> <b>performance</b> with volume of fluid model to obtain the basic design data {{for the development of}} high-efficiency toilets. Suh et al. (2009) proposed a flexible trap system that discharges feces directly from bowl hence, saves water to less than 4.5  kg. Their flexible-trap toilet uses a straight trap and cover without the traditional trapway. Watari et al. (2013) studied the 4  l toilet with new flushing technology in Japan and evaluated its drainage characteristic and the drainage-transportability. An et al. (2014) conducted a comparative analysis of the <b>flushing</b> and water-saving <b>performances</b> of a flexible-trapway toilet. The <b>flushing</b> <b>performance</b> of the toilet was quantized through the development of a measurement method to measure the accumulated flow rate and mass flow rate of the trapway with respect to time. The flexible-trapway toilet yielded stable flushing and good filth emission performance with an inflow of 4  kg. However, the fixed-trapway toilet failed to generate a steady siphon with an inflow of 5  kg.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{upcoming}} hybrid hard disks is to reduce power consumption by adding a small amount of non-volatile flash memory (NVCache) to the drive itself. By using th e NVCache to satisfy writes while the rotating media is spun-down, hard disk power consumption can be decreased by lengthening low-power periods. However, the NVCache must eventually be flushed back to the rotating media in order to cache additional data. In this paper Figure 1. Hybrid Disk we explore two questions: when and how should NVCache content be flushed to rotating media in order to minimize in Figure 1. The NVCache is stored logically adjacent to the overhead ofdata synchronization. We show that by us the rotating media.

40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature, failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed thermocouples is commonly encountered. To understand and remediate this problem, out-ofpile tests were performed with thermocouples in carburizing atmospheres {{which can be}} assumed {{to be at least}} locally representative for High Temperature Reactors. The objective was to screen those thermocouples which would consecutively be used under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed with a set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional Type N thermocouples and thermocouples with innovative sheaths) in a dedicated furnace with helium <b>flushing.</b> <b>Performance</b> indicators such as thermal drift, insulation and loop resistance were monitored and compared to those from conventional Type N thermocouples. Several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, thickness, sheath composition, temperature as well as the chemical environment. After the tests, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examinations were performed to analyze possible local damage in wires and in the sheath. The present paper describes the two experiments, summarizes results and outlines further work, in particular to further analyze the findings and to select suitable thermocouples for qualification under irradiation.

Also, {{it is necessary to}} provide a better understanding of parameters that may determine the suitability of retrofitting plumbing fixtures. The 1992 Energy Policy Acts enforces 1. 6 -gallon per flush (gpf) for a toilet and 1. 0 gpf for a urinal. In response to the regulation, the purpose of this research is to measure automatic <b>flush</b> valve <b>performance</b> (gpf) of fixtures in a mixed use classroom building at Texas A&M University. Water consumption (gpf) among three types of fixtures; low-consumption manual, old optic automatic and improved optic automatic systems are measured by using a magnetic water flow meter. The data in the study were analyzed to determine compliance with plumbing standards and to compare the average water volume per flush cycle of toilets in the men??s and women??s restrooms.

40|$|AbstractThe high {{precision}} 3 D laser scanner with the dual CCD technology {{was used to}} measure the original design sample of a siphon jet toilet. The digital toilet model was constructed from the cloud data measured with the curve and surface fitting technology and the CAD/CAE systems. The Realizable k−ɛ double equation model of the turbulence viscosity coefficient method and the VOF multiphase flow model were used to simulate the flushing flow in the toilet digital model. Through simulating and analyzing the distribution of the flushing flow's total pressure, the flow speed at the toilet-basin surface and the siphoning bent tube, the toilet performance can be evaluated efficiently and conveniently. The method of “establishing digital model, <b>flushing</b> flow simulating, <b>performances</b> evaluating, function shape modifying” would provide a high efficiency approach to develop new water-saving toilets...|$|R

40|$|Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) is an {{established}} {{process in the}} die- and toolmaking sector. Since it is independent of material hardness, brittleness or toughness and can use easy to machine tool electrode material, it is especially suitable for micro machining [1]. It is widely used {{in the production of}} nozzles such as applied in high-pressure diesel common rail or gasoline injection systems. Typical other applications are spinnerets or micro cavities in injection moulding tools. However, for deep and high-aspect-ratio bores, the insufficient <b>flushing</b> is limiting <b>performance</b> and precision. Especially for bore diameters of less than 150 µm the machining speed is dramatically reduced [2]. The application of ultrasonic vibration to the workpiece was investigated and proven to affect the micro-EDM process in a very positive way.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during 1975 and 1976 {{to evaluate the use}} of chemically cured pasture as a flushing feed for ewes in western Oregon. In 1975 (0. 56 kg/ha) and 1976 (0. 28 kg/ha) paraquat was used to chemically cure hill pasture forage when perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were in early anthesis. Crossbred ewes grazed the pastures from 17 days before through 17 days before the start of mating. In both years, paraquat treatment significantly increased protein content, but had little effect on dry matter digestibility. However, it greatly reduced herbage yield, probably due to increased shattering and decomposition losses. High summer rainfall appeared to intensify the latter problem, Using chemically cured forage as flushing feed did not improve ewe weight gains of lambing <b>performance.</b> <b>Flushing</b> ewes on chemically cured pasture appears to have little potential in areas, such as western Oregon, where summer rainfall is likely to occur...|$|R
40|$|Indirect jump {{instructions}} {{are used to}} implement increasingly-common programming constructs such as virtual function calls, switch-case statements, jump tables, and interface calls. The performance impact of indirect jumps {{is likely to increase}} because indirect jumps with multiple targets are difficult to predict even with specialized hardware. This paper proposes a new way of handling hard-to-predict indirect jumps: dynamically predicating them. The compiler (static or dynamic) identifies indirect jumps that are suitable for predication along with their control-flow merge (CFM) points. The hardware predicates the instructions between different targets of the jump and its CFM point if the jump turns out to be hard-to-predict at run time. If the jump would actually have been mispredicted, its dynamic predication eliminates a pipeline <b>flush,</b> thereby improving <b>performance.</b> Our evaluations show that Dynamic Indirect jump Predication (DIP) improves the performance of a set of objectoriented applications including the Java DaCapo benchmark suite by 37. 8 % compared to a commonly-used branch target buffer based predictor, while also reducing energy consumption by 24. 8 %. We compare DIP to three previously proposed indirect jump predictors and find that it provides the best performance and energy-efficiency. 1...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is a process}} for shaping hard metals and forming deep and complex-shaped holes by arc erosion {{in all kinds of}} electro-conductive materials. The effectiveness of EDM process with Mild Steel is evaluated in terms of the material removal rate, electrode wear rate and angle taper of the workpiece produced. The objective {{of this study is to}} study the effects of hole taper on mild steel machining using injection flushing type of EDM. Existing systems are generally used to produce, straight, parallel-walled holes, however there are certain application of the area exist taper holes and in the same time the machining performances also be considered. The problem of this project is improper flushing and electrode material would cause erratic cutting and poor machining rate or performance. For this thesis the influence of peak current, pulse on time, pulse off time and pressure <b>flushing</b> on EDM <b>performance</b> is discussed. The analysis of the influence of these factors was carried out by using full factorial experiment. The result of the experiment then was collected and analyzed by using STATISTICA Software.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The design and {{evaluation}} of off-takes has traditionally focused on increasing ram pressure recovery with little consideration given to flow uniformity. Preliminary studies on a proposed cooled cooling air system for a large aero gas turbine indicated that the offtake represented a weak point in the design with the non-uniformities it generated negatively affecting system performance. High levels of diffusion and a uniform flow are required to minimise loss and to maximise {{the effectiveness of the}} downstream heat exchanger. This paper presents a numerical and experimental parametric study of parallel wall flush off-takes with focus placed {{on the quality of the}} downstream flow and its uniformity. A realisable k-omega turbulence closure was employed with a standard wall function to examine the pressure recovery and uniformity of <b>flush</b> off-takes. The <b>performance</b> of the off-take was investigated with different inflow boundary layer thicknesses in conjunction with changes in various design parameters. The current investigation highlights that there exists a direct trade-off between the diffusion and uniformity that can be achieved by a flush offtake. Nevertheless, the work provides an improved understanding of how each performance parameters can be maximised with respect to uniformity and this knowledge is currently being applied to the development of an optimal off-take design...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of back flushing with a horizontally fixed trash rack. The concept of back flushing is to reverse the flow over the trash rack {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a flushing pipe or gate. In this study the concept of back flushing with a horizontal trash rack is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while back flushing one chamber at the time. The efficiency of back flushing as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of back flushing, general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the back flushing concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for <b>flushing</b> efficiency and <b>performance</b> during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective <b>flushing</b> and hydraulic <b>performance</b> during normal operation is identified as the height of the weir, the vertical position of the trash rack, the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the trash rack. The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top of the weir and the trash rack. A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the trash rack. A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir. During normal production the length of the model and the height of the weir are important parameters affecting both the total head loss and TKE-values. The results achieved by the numerical modelling should be validated, as further research, on a scale model designed and built in the lab. The test program for the scale model is presented in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{stainless}} steel toilets using the 1. 6 gallon per flush valve were tested and are documented in this report. One toilet is {{a version of}} the existing TDC water closet design (designated TDC 5) and represents a retrofit by changing the flush valve from 4. 0 gallons to 1. 6 gallons and modifying the rinse ring holes. TDC 5 is intended for use within the Texas prison system only and does not satisfy the performance requirements of the ASME Standard at the specified operating pressure of 35 psi static. However, by raising the operating pressure to 65 psi static, all performance criteria specified in ASME Standard A 112. 19. 6 - 1990 are met. The second toilet tested is the new prototype toilet (designated ATM 7). This toilet is designed to meet all requirements as specified in the ASME Standard and is intended for use in new prison facilities. This toilet passed all performance criteria stated in the ASME Standard when operating with the 1. 6 gallon flush valve at a static water pressure of 35 psi. However performance was very marginal and much improvement is possible. The flush line entrance diameter reduction to 1 / 4 " is too restrictive and forces an excessive amount of water to the rinse ring.

For the 0. 10 μm membrane, {{the increase in}} transmembrane pressure (TMP) from 1 to 3 bar increased the initial flux by 15. 5 % and increased the average flux {{over a period of}} 4 h by 11. 9 %. The initial flux of the 0. 10 μm membrane increased dramatically at a TMP of 1 bar when the membrane underwent a chemical cleaning with 1 % NaOH and NaOCl equivalent to 3000 ppm free chlorine for 1 h and the average flux over a period of 4 h was also increased.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} European historical log construction has heightened the need for comprehensive studies {{in different parts of}} the continent to view both the common features and the particular ones. The advanced Scandinavian research has revealed the problems of studying in depth and maintaining the log heritage when links to traditional carpentry are lost. One of the fortunate places where the log building was not interrupted and where a rich heritage in wood survives is the historical region of Maramures, today partitioned between Ukraine and Romania. The main purpose of this work is to trace the tradition of building wooden churches in central and southern Maramures from the beginning of the 16 th century to the turn of the 18 th century. Since the knowledge used to build the local wooden churches circulated throughout the European continent their understanding is of high interest long outside the region. For the present work the main sources of information are the 42 extant wooden churches, about one third of their total two centuries ago, and the outcome highly relies on their intimate reading. Another major source of knowledge is still saved by a decreasing number of practicing senior carpenters with relevant knowledge and skills in traditional carpentry. The present research was naturally concentrated on the fieldwork, where the investigation of all the extant wooden churches was complemented by interviews with active craftsmen. In search for the main sizes with relevance for their characteristic design, of central importance was to measure at the very base of each construction, the place where the builder evidently had to take key decisions. The present work is arranged in a triangle with the intention to approach the wooden churches from the following three perspectives: the local vernacular architecture, the builders and the commissioners. The first chapter is primarily concerned with the individuality of the wooden churches within the local vernacular building tradition, challenging for the first time the earlier conception of uniformity. From the Middle Ages until the turn of the 18 th century the skills, knowledge and experience to build ample log structures with plane and well sealed walls, as well as with <b>flush</b> joints, were <b>performances</b> out of the ordinary. The craftsmen from Maramures who were able to reach such levels were not simple peasants but well specialised church carpenters who inherited and maintained this advanced knowledge to exclusively build houses of worship. Since the local tradition to erect wooden churches depended on those who build and used, it is fundamental to identify the local builders and founders. The earlier blurred distinction between them veiled their separate roles in shaping the wooden churches and hindered us from a clear understanding of the results. For this reason the following two chapters are concerned with the church carpenters and the founders of churches as well as their general contribution to the local wooden churches. The extant wooden churches from Maramures reveal the existence during the 17 th and 18 th centuries of at least two main family schools of church carpenters. There are further distinguishable three main itineraries and numerous smaller ones, indicating the work of some of the most important church carpenters ever active in the region and in some cases even shifts among generations. In general, the church carpenters stood for the technical performances, the high quality of the wood work and the artistic refinement. In a long perspective, the true creators of the local wooden churches were actually the commissioning founders. Especially the role of the noble founders of Eastern rite was decisive in the formation of a regional character among the local wooden churches. The wooden churches from Maramures closely mirror the local society of modest country landlords, manifesting themselves along several centuries in their double condition of Eastern Christians and Western nobles. The wooden churches from Maramures open necessary connections with similar performances throughout Europe. Seemingly the local distinction made between sacred and profane rooms was characteristic for many other rural regions on the continent. The highest knowledge in log building seems to have had a sacred purpose with wide continental circulation and therefore in many places requires distinction from the more regionally rooted vernacular one...|$|R
