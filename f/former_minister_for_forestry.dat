5000|$|For centuries, the {{two cities}} Furtwangen and Donaueschingen compete for an {{official}} status which declaires their own source as the official source of the Danube. The city Furtwangen is located along the upper river Breg, while the city Donaueschingen {{is located at the}} symbolic source of the Danube. At times, the issue even involves the government of Baden-Württemberg. After the city council Donaueschingen intervened in 1981, for example, the Ministry of the Interior in Stuttgart announced that [...] "the source of the Breg is not anymore displayed as the source of the Danube on ministerial maps. The land surveying office was instructed to act accordingly." [...] However, the <b>former</b> <b>minister</b> <b>for</b> agriculture and <b>forestry</b> confirmed in a document addressed to Prof. Öhrlein in 1982: [...] "Getting back to the issue regarding the source of the Danube, I can once again confirm that the so-called source of the Danube in Donaueschingen is certainly not the real source of the river Danube, if analysed with geographical and hydrological criteria. The river Breg can rightly be called the main stream of the Danube." ...|$|R
