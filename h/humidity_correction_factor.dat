Considering the influence of altitude and air <b>humidity,</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for gas injection rate is calculated. The value of gas injection for altitude correction factor generally increases {{with the increase in}} altitude, especially when conducting air drilling in high altitude areas of western China the correction factor of Qinghai oilfield can be calculated as high as 1. 5. When the air humidity increases, the gas injection <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> also increases; especially before raining in summer, the air <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> can be close to 1. 1, under the condition of relatively high air humidity and temperature. In the light of the calculation result and example analysis, it can be found that combining with this article’s altitude and air humidity correction, the result of the amended minimum kinetic energy standard using Boyun Guo’s correlation is the closest to the actual one, which can be used for the calculation of the minimum gas injection rate in industry practice while other methods have relatively larger errors...|$|E

The influence of the water content on the lubricity and the relationship between humidity and water content of the fuel has been studied revealing that the effect of the air humidity is an indirect effect of the hygroscopy of the fuel...|$|E

40|$|The {{dual purpose}} of the present work was first to examine the effect of {{humidity}} and gas density on the breakdown characteristics of short airgaps and secondly to investigate whether charge injection data could provide additional information concerning the probability of breakdown at low probability levels. Impulse tests were, therefore, performed in a sealed test vessel using laboratory air for pressures in the range 0. 7 - 1. 4 bar and absolute humidity levels from ~ 2 to 15 g/ m 3. Both pressure and humidity could be closely controlled and measured. The impulse shape was + 100 / 2500 fis and the test gap consisted of a 5 cm-diameter sphere at 20 cm above an earthed plane. Statistical flashover tests and measurements of apparent charge injection at the sphere were made and both sets of data were analysed using the method of maximum likelihood. The breakdown probabilities were found to satisfy a normal distribution and the charge measurements provided significant additional information at low probability levels. The measured values of V 50 were found to depend linearly upon absolute humidity with a slope of 1. 5 kV/g/m 3 at all pressures. The withstand voltages, on the other hand, were only weakly dependent upon absolute <b>humidity.</b> The <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> found in the present work agree well with the IEC standard at 1. 2 and 1. 4 bar, but depart appreciably at lower pressures...|$|R

Advisor: Dr. Julian Marshall. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 64 pages, appendix:Literature Review of Outdoor Air Quality in the Developing World. This study measured outdoor fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentrations in a low- and a nearby middle-income neighborhood in Bangalore, India. Each neighborhood included two sampling locations: near and not-near a major roadway. One-minute mean concentrations were recorded for 168 days during September 2008 - May 2009 using a nephelometer (TSI DustTrak). Wind speed and direction were also measured, {{as well as}} PM 2. 5 concentration {{as a function of}} distance from roadway. Mean concentrations are 21 - 46 % higher in the low- than in the middle-income neighborhood (64 μg m- 3 versus 53 μg m- 3 [neighborhood median]). In the middle-income neighborhood, median concentrations are higher near roadway than not-near roadway (56 μg m- 3 versus 50 μg m- 3); in the low-income neighborhood, the reverse holds (68 μg m- 3 near roadway, 74 μg m- 3 not-near roadway), likely because of within-neighborhood residential emissions (e. g., cooking; trash combustion). These concentrations exceed long-term US EPA and WHO standards (15 μg m- 3 and 10 μg m- 3, respectively). A moving-average subtraction method used to infer local- versus urban-scale emissions confirms that local emissions are greater in the low-income neighborhood than in the middle-income neighborhood; however, relative contributions from local sources vary by time-of-day.

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} dosimetry {{is used to}} describe those measurements or calculations that provide information on the energy deposited by the interaction of ionizing radiation with matter. Radiation dosimetry is of importance in several areas, including radiation therapy, radiation protection, and the industrial use of radiation. Several techniques {{have been developed for}} measuring energy deposition, with ionization chambers and calorimeters being the most important. These techniques form the basis of primary measurement standards for ionizing radiation, and these primary standards require values and uncertainty estimates for certain key parameters used to relate the result of measurement to the desired quantity. The calculation of the interaction of radiation with matter using Monte Carlo techniques is now well developed and can be used to study energy deposition for problems where measurements are difficult or impossible. Both measurements and calculations require knowledge of basic quantities related to the interaction of radiation with matter. These include data on photon cross sections, electron stopping powers, and the average energy to create an ion pair, to name a few. These data are often referred to as “key data. ” This Report examines key data for stopping powers for charged particles ranging from electrons to carbon ions. Values and uncertainties are assigned to the mean excitation energies for air, graphite, and liquid water, and tables of stopping powers covering the energy range from 1 keV to 1 GeV, or higher, are provided. Photon cross sections for air, water, and graphite are reviewed, examined, and compared with relevant measurements to estimate their uncertainties. Values are recommended for the average energy to create an ion pair in air, Wair. The available data for the chemical yield for Fricke dosimetry and for the heat defects for graphite and liquid water are summarized, as is the <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for air-filled ionization chambers and the correction to the measured charge due to the initial ion pairs created by an incident photon. Data for the correction in photon and electron beams at low energies for the deviation of Wair from the recommended asymptotic value are also summarized. The impact of the recommended changes is discussed. Important changes are an increase in the uncertainty for air-kerma measurements with free-air chambers and a decrease of about 0. 7 % in 60 Co air-kerma measurements. The recommended stopping powers for graphite and liquid water differ by up to 1 % from those previously recommended. For {{radiation dosimetry}} based on ionization chambers calibrated against absorbed-dose-to-water calorimeters, changes in the measured absorbed dose to water will not exceed 0. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{dielectric}} strength of insulating materials in a non-uniform electric field under impulse voltages is investigated with emphasis given on {{the influence of}} humidity. Research on interactions between electrical discharges and insulating surfaces is of great importance, not only from the physical but also from the applications standpoints. In addition, the surface {{dielectric strength}} of insulators determines to a great extent the reliability of high voltage systems. Outdoor insulation systems, comprising of air gaps together with ceramic or polymeric insulators, are often subject to high voltage transients, thus their efficient design requires knowledge of the surface dielectric behaviour of insulators under such conditions. Interactions between electrical discharges and insulating surfaces involve multiple physical processes many of which are not yet fully understood. Moreover, minimal data are available in literature concerning the effects of atmospheric conditions on flashover. Thus, in the present study surface impulse flashover along smooth cylindrical insulating surfaces bridging a 12 cm long rod-plane gap is investigated; the insulating surface material, the waveshape and polarity of the applied impulse voltage, as well as absolute humidity were considered as influencing parameters. The main conclusions of the thesis are summarized as follows. The initial corona in the presence of an insulator initiates earlier, under lower voltage and is associated with lower charge, because of the electric field enhancement near the rod tip. However, near threshold inception conditions the initial corona inception field decreases with the insulating surface material permittivity, a fact that can be attributed to enhanced photo-ionisation around the rod tip. Under positive lightning impulse voltages the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an insulating surface. Flashover is closely related to secondary corona inception, the spark channel develops away from the insulating surface, a behaviour found characteristic for polymeric insulating surfaces but not for the case of porcelain. Under positive switching impulse voltages the flashover voltage is higher in the presence of an insulating surface. Flashover is closely related to streamer arrival at the earthed plane. Under positive impulse voltages, flashover voltage increases with increasing absolute humidity. The inhibitory effect of humidity on flashover voltage is similar to that observed for the pure air gap for the cases where the spark channel develops away from the insulating surface. The effect of humidity is reduced when the spark channel develops close to the insulating surface. In general, for insulating arrangements where at flashover the spark channel adheres to the insulator surface the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure could be optimized by considering a reduced <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor.</b> Under negative impulse voltages, the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an insulating surface, a fact that could be attributed to the lower average field required for surface streamers to cross the full gap. Negative corona development is favoured by the insulating surface, the spark channel adheres {{to the surface of the}} insulator. The effect of humidity on flashover voltage is minimal, the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure yields satisfactory results. ...|$|E
40|$|Engine thermal and {{lubricant}} {{systems have}} only recently been a serious focus in engine design and in general remain under passive control. The introduction of active control has shown benefits in fuel consumption during the engine warm-up period, however {{there is a lack}} of rigorous calibration of these devices in conjunction with other engine systems. For these systems, benefits in fuel consumption (FC) are small and accurate measurement systems are required. Analysis of both FC and NOx emissions measurements processes was conducted and showed typical errors of 1 % in FC from thermal expansion and 2 % in NOx per g/kg change in absolute <b>humidity.</b> <b>Correction</b> <b>factors</b> were derived both empirically and from first principles to account for these disturbances. These improvements are applicable to the majority of experimental facilities and will be essential as future engine developments are expected to be achieved through small incremental steps. Using prototype hardware installed on a production 2. 4 L Diesel engine, methodologies for optimising the design, control and integration of these systems were demonstrated. Design of experiments (DoE) based approaches were used to model the engine behaviour under transient conditions. A subsequent optimisation procedure demonstrated a 3. 2 % reduction in FC during warm-up from 25 °C under iso-NOx conditions. This complemented a 4 % reduction from reduced oil pumping work using a variable displacement pump. A combination of classical DoE and transient testing allowed the dynamic behaviour of the engine to be captured empirically when prototype hardware is available. Furthermore, the enhancement of dynamic DoE approaches to include the thermal condition of the engine can produce models that, when combined with other available simulation packages, offer a tool for design optimisation when hardware is not available. These modelling approaches are applicable to a wide number of problems to evaluate design considerations at different stages of the engine development process. These allow the transient thermal behaviour of the engine to be captured, significantly enhancing conventional model based calibration approaches.

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} the cloud ice {{parameterization}} in the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model cloud physics parameterization are examined: the conversion of cloud ice to snow by depositional growth, designated PSFI, and the saturation adjustment scheme. The original formulation of PSFI is shown to produce excessive conversion of cloud ice to snow because of an implicit assumption that the relative humidity is 100 % with respect to water even though the air may actually be quite less humid. Two possible corrections to this problem are proposed, the first involving application of a relative <b>humidity</b> dependent <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> to the original formulation of PSFI, and the second involving a new formulation of PSFI based on the equation for depositional growth of cloud ice. The sensitivity of these formulations of PSFI to the assumed masses of the ice particles is examined.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{investigation of the}} factors governing the quantification of formic acid (FA), acetic acid (AA), and their relevant mass analogues by proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), assess the underlying fragmentation pathways and humidity dependencies, and present a new method for separating FA and AA from their main isobaric interferences. PTR-MS sensitivities towards glycolaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and peroxyacetic acid at m/z 61 are comparable to that for AA; when present, these species will interfere with ambient AA measurements by PTR-MS. Likewise, when it is present, dimethyl ether can interfere with FA measurements. For a reduced electric field (E/N) of 125 Townsend (Td), the PTR-MS sensitivity towards ethanol at m/z 47 is 5 – 20 times lower than for FA; ethanol will then only be an important interference when present in much higher abundance than FA. Sensitivity towards 2 -propanol is < 1 % of that for AA, so that propanols will not in general represent a significant interference for AA. Hydrated product ions of AA, glycolaldehyde, and propanols occur at m/z 79, which is also commonly used to measure benzene. However, the resulting interference for benzene is only significant when E/N is low (≲ 100 Td). Addition of water vapor affects the PTR-MS response to a given compound by (i) changing the yield for fragmentation reactions and (ii) increasing the importance of ligand switching reactions. In the case of AA, sensitivity to the molecular ion increases with humidity at low E/N but decreases with humidity at high E/N due to water-driven fragmentation. Sensitivity towards FA decreases with humidity throughout {{the full range of}} E/N. For glycolaldehyde and the alcohols, the sensitivity increases with humidity due to ligand switching reactions (at low E/N) and reduced fragmentation in the presence of water (at high E/N). Their role as interferences will typically be greatest at high humidity. For compounds such as AA where the humidity effect depends strongly on the collisional energy in the drift tube, simple <b>humidity</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> (X R) will only be relevant for a specific instrumental configuration. We recommend E/N ~ 125 Td as an effective condition for AA and FA measurements by PTR-MS, as it optimizes between the competing E/N -dependent mechanisms controlling their sensitivities and those of the interfering species. Finally, we present the design and evaluation of an online acid trap for separating AA and FA from their interfering species at m/z 61 and 47, and we demonstrate its performance during a field deployment to St. Louis, USA, during August–September of 2013...|$|R

The apparent in vitro CL b of a training set of 21 compounds was determined using the SCH model and extrapolated to apparent in vivo CL b (CL b, app). A universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (10. 2) was obtained by a linear regression of the predicted CL b, app and observed in vivo CL b of training set compounds and applied to an independent test set (n = 20); the corrected CL b predictions of 13 compounds were within twofold error of observed values.

40|$|We study nuclear {{effects of}} charged current deep inelastic neutrino-iron {{scattering}} {{in the framework}} of a chi^ 2 analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs). We extract a set of iron PDFs which are used to compute x_Bj-dependent and Q^ 2 -dependent nuclear <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for iron structure functions which are required in global analyses of free nucleon PDFs. We compare our results with nuclear <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> from neutrino-nucleus scattering models and <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for charged lepton-iron scattering. We find that, except for very high x_Bj, our <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> differ in both shape and magnitude from the <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> of the models and charged-lepton scattering.

40|$|If local {{arterial}} {{input function}} (AIF) could be identified, {{we present a}} theoretical approach to generate a <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> based on local AIF for the estimation of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) under the framework of early time points perfusion imaging (ET). If C(t), the contrast agent bolus concentration signal time course, is used for rCBF estimation in ET, the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for C(t) is the integral of its local AIF. The recipe to apply the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is to divide C(t) by the integral of its local AIF to obtain the correct rCBF. By similar analysis, the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for the maximum derivative (MD 1) of C(t) is the maximum signal of AIF and the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for the maximum second derivative (MD 2) of C(t) is the maximum derivative of AIF. In the specific case of using normalized gamma-variate function {{as a model for}} AIF, the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for C(t) (but not for MD 1) at the time to reach the maximum derivative is relatively insensitive to the shape of the local AIF.

30|$|Based on the authors’ best knowledge, no sensor {{location}} <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> {{has been}} studied and published so far. To address this need, an extensive air velocity study was conducted at the SRCM to obtain the site-specific <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for the current and potential future sensor locations in the mine. The objective {{of this paper is}} to establish a set of <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for the selected locations at the SRCM.|$|R
30|$|Perusal to Eq. (5 a) {{suggests}} that a meaningful exact shear <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> can be obtained if both the Reddy plate and Kirchhoff plate deflections are known. Neglecting the higher order term in Eq. (5 a) gives a shear <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> of κ[*]=[*] 14 / 17. The two constant shear <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> of 5 / 6 and 14 / 17 have been discussed by Wang et al. (2000).|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{refinements}} to {{the finite}} source <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> used in holdup measurements. Specifically {{it focuses on}} a more general method to estimate the average detector response for a finite source. This proposed method for the average detector response is based directly on the Generalized Geometry Holdup (GGH) assay method. First, the finite source <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> as originally proposed is reviewed in this paper. Following this review the GGH assay method is described. Lastly, a new finite area calibration factor based on GGH is then proposed for finite point and line sources. As {{an alternative to the}} direct use of the finite arca calibration <b>factor,</b> finite source <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are also derived from this calibration <b>factor.</b> This new <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> {{can be used in a}} manner similar to the finite source <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> as currently implemented...|$|R
