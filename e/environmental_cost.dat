25|$|To address prawn farm {{issue the}} Jagannathans {{organised}} {{the whole of}} LAFTI's village movement to raise awareness among the people to oppose the prawn farms. Since 1993, the villagers have offered Satygraha (non-violent resistance), through rallies, fasts, and demonstrations in protest of establishing the prawn farms. They have been beaten up by hired goons, their houses have been burnt, and LAFTI workers have been imprisoned, because of false accusations of looting and arson. Undeterred by this, Jagannathan filed a 'public interest petition' in the Indian Supreme Court, which in turn asked NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Institute of India) to investigate the matter. NEERI's investigation report highlighted the <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> of the prawn farms to the nation and recommended all prawn farms within 500 meters of the coast to be banned.

500|$|Much of Stelmach's term as Premier was {{dominated}} by questions related to the Athabasca Oil Sands. The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions.

When Liberal Party of Canada leader Stéphane Dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces.

500|$|Critics have {{described}} the three-city arrangement as a [...] "travelling circus" [...] with a cost an extra 200 million euro over a single location. Defenders of the Strasbourg seat, like the MEP for Germany Bernd Posselt, however claim that the figure is rather a mere 40 million euro, i.e. an extra cost of 8 cents per EU citizen. When Parliament was forced to meet in Brussels in September 2008, due to a fault in the Strasbourg building, {{it was estimated that}} Parliament saved between €3 and 4 million, though the exact figure is hard to calculate. As the Commission also meets in Strasbourg when Parliament is out of Brussels, the cost of Commissioners moving amounted to €9.5 million between 2002 and 2007. The Green party has also noted the <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> in a study led by Jean Lambert, MEP and Caroline Lucas, MEP; in addition to the extra financial cost, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union.

500|$|The Strasbourg seat {{is seen as}} {{a symbol}} of {{reconciliation}} between France and Germany, the Strasbourg region having been fought over by the two countries in the past. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe, Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a [...] "travelling circus", and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing through numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that [...] "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol—of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions". The Green Party has also noted the <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia Malmström MEP. In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save €113.8 million per year. In 2006, there were allegations of irregularity in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to inquire on the impacts that excessive intensification has on productivity and <b>environmental</b> <b>costs</b> in the long term and, additionally to explore empirically the trend of these two indicators over time. The contribution of this study is twofold: (a) to engage in the discussion that although intensification can boost yields and lower costs in the short-term, it might lead in the opposite direction in the long-term due to environmental and economic issues and (b) to explore current trends of productivity and <b>environmental</b> <b>costs</b> of farming. To this end, this paper performs a panel data analysis of productivity and <b>environmental</b> <b>costs</b> on a farm accounting database across European regions over the 1989 - 2009 period.

The GNH Index, {{also known as}} Gross National Well-being (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic development framework. Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon {{the gross domestic product}} (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the Genuine Progress Indicator was focused on the <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the Human Development Index (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness. The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall knowledge level (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it [...] is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year). [...] To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year). [...] They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that [...] "the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.|$|E
