5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave <b>it</b> <b>its</b> current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|At the time, floating-point {{division}} was generally expensive compared to multiplication; the fast inverse square root algorithm bypassed the division step, giving <b>it</b> <b>its</b> performance advantage. Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game, used the fast inverse square root algorithm to accelerate graphics computation, but the algorithm {{has since been}} implemented in some dedicated hardware vertex shaders using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).|$|E
5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known about their behavior. Before then, most information about the marsh shrew was from notes about the mammal's habitat and information about trapping <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> descriptions in the literature were largely derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|E

The hotel was bought by the Savoy Company in 1895 and rebuilt in a red brick design, and extended again in 1931. Several European royal families in exile stayed at the hotel during World War II. Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia was born at the hotel on 17 July 1945; the Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{is said to have}} declared the suite he was born in to be Yugoslav territory.|$|E
5|$|Coenraad Jacob Temminck first {{described}} the Japanese serow in 1836, and named it Antilope crispa. John Edward Gray gave <b>it</b> <b>its</b> current name in 1846.

5|$|Crewe House {{was built}} in the late 18th century on the site of a house on Curzon Street owned by Edward Shepherd, a key builder and {{architect}} around Mayfair. It was bought by James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe in 1818 and became known as Wharncliffe House. In 1899, it was purchased by Robert Crewe-Milnes, Earl Crewe, giving <b>it</b> <b>its</b> current name. The house is now part of the Saudi Arabian Embassy.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives <b>it</b> <b>its</b> vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make <b>it</b> (<b>its</b> efficient cause); and the design laid out for <b>it</b> (<b>its</b> eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down or up to explore the data and various visual representations of <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|Muslims {{believe that}} the stone was {{originally}} pure and dazzling white, but has since turned black because of {{the sins of the}} people who touch <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> black colour is deemed to symbolize the essential spiritual virtue of detachment and poverty for God (faqr) and the extinction of ego required to progress towards God (qalb).|$|E

5|$|The Eye of Ra was {{involved}} {{in many areas of}} ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> life-giving power was celebrated in temple rituals, and its dangerous aspect was invoked in the protection of the pharaoh, of sacred places, and of ordinary people and their homes.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives <b>it</b> <b>its</b> black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{geologic}} {{forms on}} the planet to suggest the presence of water over the past billion years. However, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that Venus was an exception to the processes that formed Earth and gave <b>it</b> <b>its</b> water during its early history, possibly from the original rocks that formed the planet or later on from comets. The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{two years}} after the Republic of Armenia was established, on 23 April 1920, the United States officially {{recognized}} <b>it.</b> <b>Its</b> frontiers were to be determined later. On 26 April 1920, the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris (British Prime Minister Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti) requested that the United States accept the mandate over Armenia and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of Armenia with Turkey. President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations. In July 1920, the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and Armenia, headed by William Westermann. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920. On 28 September 1920, the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between Armenia and Turkey. It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for Armenia via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey's border regions demilitarization frontier line.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5220). Now {{on display in}} the American Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving <b>it</b> <b>its</b> own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described.|$|E
