25|$|Sharad Joshi, {{founder of}} Shetkari Sangathana (<b>farmers</b> <b>association),</b> has {{announced}} {{his support for}} retail reforms. Joshi claims FDI will help the farm sector improve critical infrastructure and integrate farmer-consumer relationship. Today, the existing retail {{has not been able}} to supply fresh vegetables to the consumers because they have not invested in the backward integration. When the farmers' produce reaches the end consumer directly, the farmers will naturally be benefited. Joshi feels retail reform is just a first step of needed agricultural reforms in India, and that the government should pursue additional reforms.|$|E

Specifically, the surveys focus on the capacity of four actors–MINAGRI Regional and District Agents, NGOs, District Governments (the Mayors) and <b>farmer</b> <b>associations</b> and intergroupements to provide farmers with agricultural services that might help in the transition from semi-subsistence to commercial agriculture. As this synthesis paper indicates, some of these services have been provided on an irregular basis for many years through a variety of government, NGO, donor agency and private business efforts. Moreover, this paper highlights {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these four key actors; it also identifies areas for improvement, and recommends ways for enhancing the efficiency and equity of services available to <b>farmers</b> through <b>farmer</b> <b>associations.</b> food security, food policy, Rwanda, <b>farmer</b> <b>associations,</b> International Development, Q 18,...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{building}} at the Market, the Main Arcade, opened November 30, 1907. At its opening, a forty-piece band performed for a large cheering crowd. During {{the early years of}} the Pike Place Market, Seattle city ordinances limited its hours of operation to only 5 am to 12 noon, Monday through Saturday, and placed initial supervision of the facility with the city Department of Streets and Sewers. Local police gave out vendor stalls to farmers on a first come, first served basis. In 1910, two farmers' associations organized themselves: the Washington <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> represented Japanese farmers; other farmers organized as the White Home Growers Association. By 1911, demand for the Market had grown so much that the number of available stalls had doubled, and extended north from Pike Street to Stewart Street, doubling in size since the opening of the Main Arcade. The west side of the stall lines were soon covered in an overhead canopy and roofing, becoming known as the [...] "dry row". The daily rent for any stall in 1911 was $0.20 a day.|$|E

2500|$|Queensland's 1876 Intercolonial Exhibition was not {{the first}} {{competitive}} demonstration of agricultural and industrial progress in the colony. In 1854, squatters from the Darling Downs and Moreton Bay districts of New South Wales established the Northern Districts' Agricultural and Pastoral Association, modelled on the Scottish Highland Agricultural Societies. They planned to hold exhibitions (mainly of pastoral produce) at Brisbane, Ipswich, Warwick, Drayton and Gayndah, in rotation, and some shows were held before the Association became immersed in more political activities. Nurseryman Albert John Hockings was instrumental in holding horticultural shows in Brisbane from 1855. In the 1860s other regional agricultural and pastoral associations were formed, among the earliest being the Darling Downs Agricultural Society (based at Toowoomba) in 1860, the Drayton and Toowoomba Agricultural and Horticultural Society in 1864, the East Moreton <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> (based at Ipswich) in 1866 and the Eastern Downs Horticultural and Agricultural Association (based at Warwick) in 1867. These Associations conducted annual exhibitions of agricultural, horticultural, and pastoral produce and farm machinery. Prizes were awarded for best exhibits. The object was to encourage the exchange of knowledge and to foster better farm practice. Associations such as these proliferated in Queensland {{during the second half of}} the 19th century and each held an annual [...] "show".|$|E

2500|$|The WWF were {{particularly}} important in changing {{the perception of the}} French authorities in support for dam building to environmental protection and sustainable management of its river basin. In 1992, they aided the ‘Loire Nature’ project, which received funds of some $US 9 million under the EU's ‘LIFE’ programme until 1999, embarking upon restoration to the river's ecosystems and wildlife. That year, the Upper Loire Valley <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> was also established through a partnership between SOS Loire Vivante and a farmers’ union to promote sustainable rural tourism. The French government adopted the Natural Loire River Plan (Plan Loire Grandeur Nature) in January 1994, initiating the decommissioning of three dams on the river. The final dam was decommissioned by Électricité de France at a cost of 7million francs in 1998. The basis of the decision was that the economic benefits of the dams did not outweigh their significant ecological impacts, so the intention was to restore the riverine ecosystems and replenish great Loire salmon stocks. The Loire is unique in this respect as the Atlantic salmon can swim as far as [...] up the river and spawn in {{the upper reaches of the}} Allier. The French government undertook this major plan, chiefly because pollution and overfishing had reduced approximately 100,000 salmon migrating annually to their spawning grounds in the headwaters of the Loire and its tributaries to just 67 salmon in 1996 on the upper Allier.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Lemass {{appointed}} Haughey as Minister for Agriculture. Criticism was voiced {{from the}} National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Association</b> (NFA) of {{the appointment of}} a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside Leinster House (the parliament building) were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the Offences Against the State Act, an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were {{not in a position to}} hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna Fáil turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. Eventually Haughey backed down from the confrontation, for electoral reasons connected to the imminent presidential election. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the [...] "Farmers' Strike".|$|E
2500|$|Further {{expansion}} {{took place}} in the early 21st century when [...] "Master Horgan's Field" [...] adjacent to the northern boundary of the old graveyard was developed as a modern residential quarter. In earlier decades, the site was owned by Mr. Peter Horgan, a native of Kilmichael, County Cork, a place which won fame as the site of the famous ambush of the same name which took place there during the War of Independence, a fact of which the old master was very proud. Mr.Horgan was the long-time Principal of Bansha Boys National School in succession to Masters Pat Leahy and David Dee and also managed his own public house in Barrack Street. He also grew his own sallies on the river bank within the confines of his riverside garden, now sadly no more. These sallies made an occasional appearance in class and were an effective deterrent to wayward pupils. Nonthelass, he was a much loved character, reminiscent of Oliver Goldsmith's [...] "Village Schoolmaster". The only buildings on the site prior to development were the village telephone exchange erected in the 1960s and the [...] "Farmers Hall", a wooden building of fragile construction, which was erected in the mid 20th century by the young <b>farmers</b> <b>association</b> in the parish which was a precursor of Macra na Feirme. It was used for dancing, variety shows, [...] "pongo" [...] which was a form of modern-day bingo and on Sunday afternoons up to about 1962, as a rendezvous by locals who wished to tune into the commentary of major hurling and football matches relayed from Croke Park on [...] Radio Éireann. The building endured until the 1960s when because of dilapidation, it was eventually closed, after which the Parochial Hall became the sole entertainment centre for the village and surrounding area.|$|E
