The institution of a <b>defectivity</b> program has identified defect generators within the process flow and efforts to reduce <b>defectivity</b> at the sputtered layer of the bottom plate and evaporated layer of the top plate HDMIM capacitor formation are reported.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} impact of control plan design of <b>defectivity</b> {{inspections}} for tool risk management. <b>Defectivity</b> inspections are performed on products and can reveal the yield loss produced by contaminations or structural flaws. The risk considered in this paper concerns the exposure level of wafers on a tool between two <b>defectivity</b> controls. Our goal is to analyze how control plans can impact the manufacturing robustness {{from the point of}} view of wafer at risk on tools. A smart sampling strategy is considered for sampling lots to be measured. Actual data from the Rousset fab of STMicroelectronics are used. The simulation experiments are performed using the S 5 Simulator developed by EMSE-CMP.

40|$|<b>Defectivity</b> {{has been}} {{historically}} {{identified as a}} leading technical roadblock {{to the implementation of}} nanoimprint lithography for semiconductor high volume manufacturing. The lack of confidence in nanoimprint's ability to meet defect requirements originates in part from the industry's past experiences with 1 × lithography and the shortage in enduser generated defect data. SEMATECH has therefore initiated a defect assessment aimed at addressing these concerns. The goal is to determine whether nanoimprint, specifically Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography from Molecular Imprints, is capable of meeting semiconductor industry defect requirements. At this time, several cycles of learning have been completed in SEMATECH's defect assessment, with promising results. J-FIL process random <b>defectivity</b> of < 0. 1 def/cm 2 has been demonstrated using a 120 nm half-pitch template, providing proof of concept that a low defect nanoimprint process is possible.

Particularly, bottom-up alternative lithographic masks from directed self-assembly systems have been extending the limits of critical dimensions in a cost-effective manner although great challenges in controlling <b>defectivity</b> remain open. To gain insights about the percentage of alignment, <b>defectivity</b> and order quantification, block copolymer fingerprints were investigated via an image analysis methodology. Here we present the analysis of hexagonal phase of polystyrene-b-polydimethylsiloxane (PS-b-PDMS) forming linear patterns in topological substrates. From our methodology, we have performed {{dimensional metrology}} estimating pitch size and error, and the linewidth of the lines was estimated. In parallel, the methodology allowed us identification and quantification of typical defects observable in self-assembly, such as turning points, disclination or branching points, break or lone points and end points. The methodology presented here represents a step forward in dimensional metrology and defect analysis of self- and directed assembly systems.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, control of process tools has {{progressively}} moved from bare non-product wafers inspection toward on-product measurements. Nevertheless, in high-mix facilities, recipe creation {{for all products}} is not possible. Most of the semiconductor fabs use today "high runners" lots that are flagged for <b>defectivity.</b> Due to non-linearity and variability of the line [1], lots may be stopped, overtake each-other or ignore certain tools. This is the drawback of this sampling method: {{the efficiency of the}} <b>defectivity</b> measurement with respect to information is often under optimal. On an other hand, the measurement equipments are very expensive and fabs are limited in capacity of inspection. Using the sampling method already quoted, we take the risk of controlling some lots unnecessarily. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate this risk and to propose a solution to optimize the use of control equipment. The case study described here takes place in STMicroelectronics 300 mm wafer fab in Crolles, France. It considers the global fab toolset and studies the skip, under some assumptions, of a <b>defectivity</b> measurement. The Wafer-At-Risk is in use as the risk evaluation of each tool. The information brought by each lot that can be inspected is called the Wafer-At-Risk-Reduction.

To date, photolithography has been able to meet the demand for ever smaller devices despite the constraints imposed by the diffraction limit and the expense of deep and extreme UV light sources. However, as device sizes continue to shrink, alternative lithographic technologies, including nanoimprint lithography, must be considered if the current trends are to continue at their rapid pace.

In particular, {{attention is paid to}} Catalan’s weak left peripheral activity, which prevents it from generating sentences that involve a Çmild focalizationÈ pattern very common in Spanish (e. g., «Mucha tontería dice el Gobierno» vs. *«Molta ximpleria diuel Govern»), first noted by Torrego (1980) and further explored by Uriagereka (1988).
