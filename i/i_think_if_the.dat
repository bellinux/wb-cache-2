60|$|I {{know nothing}} of the damage done the enemy. We had the best of it, so far as I could see; and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> weather had not {{compelled}} us to haul off, something serious might have been done. As it was, we beat out with flying colours, and anchored {{a few miles from}} the light.|$|E

"Perhaps {{they might}} not, were it stated in just these terms; yet <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of {{the establishment of an}} order of aristocracy among us were put to vote, we should find more women than men who would go for it; and they would flout at the consequences to society with the lively wit and the musical laugh which make feminine selfishness so genteel and agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. To the question, HOW THIS MONEY SHALL BE RAISED. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Parliament {{settle the}} tax on the county for eight years at 30,000 pounds per annum, no man need ask how it shall be raised [...] . It will be easy enough to raise the money; and no parish can grudge to pay a little larger rate for such a term, on {{condition}} never to be taxed for the highways any more.|$|E
6000|$|I see Crupp {{now with}} his arm bent before him {{on the table in}} a way we had, as though it was jointed {{throughout}} its length like a lobster's antenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a walnut shell into smaller and smaller fragments. [...] "Remington," [...] he said, [...] "has given us the data for a movement, a really possible movement. It's not only possible, but necessary--urgently necessary, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Empire is to go on." ...|$|E

6000|$|At first I had a fear, a {{dislike of}} the ocean. But that is gone. It [...] is indescribable {{to stand on}} the open deck at night as we are [...] driving on and on and on--to look up at the grand, silent stars, [...] that know, that understand, yet are somehow merciless--to look out [...] across the starlit, moving sea. Its ceaseless {{movement}} at first [...] distressed me; now I feel that it is perpetually moving to try to [...] become still. To seek a level! To find itself! To quiet down to [...] peace! But that will never be. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ocean is not like [...] the human heart, then what is it like? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it was not}} {{for that}} I don't suppose the captain would object to put you ashore. He has evidently taken a fancy to you, and is pleased with the way in which you have taken things and with your smartness and willingness. Beside, I don't think he {{considers}} you altogether as a prisoner. Running you down in the way we did in the channel wasn't like capturing you in a prize, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> captain could see his way to letting you go without risk to himself he would do it. As he can't do that he will have a sharp watch kept on you, and I advise you not to be in any hurry to try to escape. You must remember if you were caught trying it they would shoot you to a certainty." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Romeo {{came upon}} the stage he was {{received}} with loud applause. But my lady showed no interest,--not she, while the doctor fervently recited, [...] "Out of her favour, where I am in love." [...] In the first orchard scene, with the boldness of a practised lover, he almost ignored Mrs. Hallam in the balcony. It seemed as though he cast his burning words and languishing glances at my lady in the box, whereupon there was a deal of nudging round about. Miss asked for her smelling salts, and declared the place was stifling. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> doctor had cherished a hope of her affections he lost it {{when he arrived at}} the lines, [...] "She speaks, yet she says nothing." [...] At that unhappy moment Miss Dorothy was deep in conversation with Fitzhugh, the audible titter in the audience arousing her. How she reddened when she perceived the faces turned her way! ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Siegel {{has said}} that the park [...] "has now become this {{somewhat}} forlorn urban park... It's a place that no longer reflects the will for independence of the campus community. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> today <b>if</b> <b>the</b> university turned off its Wi-Fi, they’d get bigger demonstrations than they would for People's Park." ...|$|R

I {{tell you}} exactly what <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> we pretend <b>the</b> men are not {{suffering}}, it's humbug; and if they're suffering, we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more, and as to the children--well--it's damnable! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Bible did {{not answer}} that {{question}} {{it would not be}} a complete book--if it spoke only of peaceful folk, and peaceful times; when, alas! from the beginning of the world, the earth has been but too full of violence and misrule, war and desolation. But the Bible does answer that question. A large portion of one whole book is actually taken up with the history of a young outlaw--of David, the shepherd boy, who rises through strange temptations and dangers to be a great king, the first man who, since Moses, formed the Jews into one strong united nation. It does not hide his faults, even his fearful sins, but it shows us that he had a right road to follow, though he often turned aside from it. It shows us that he could be a good man if he chose, though he was an outlaw at the head of a band of ruffians; and it shows us the secret of his power and of his success--Faith in the Living God.|$|E
60|$|I say I desire, in commenting {{upon these}} various points, and judging them as fairly as I can {{by the light}} of {{increased}} experience, to particularly emphasise this last, because I am told, although I assuredly do not know it of my own knowledge--though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fact were so I ought to know it, being tolerably well acquainted with that which goes on in the scientific world, and which has gone on there for the last thirty years--that {{there is a kind of}} sect, or horde, of scientific Goths and Vandals, who think it would be proper and desirable to sweep away all other forms of culture and instruction, except those in physical science, and to make them the universal and exclusive, or, at any rate, the dominant training of the human mind of the future generation. This is not my view--I do not believe that it is anybody's view,--but it is attributed to those who, like myself, advocate scientific education. I therefore dwell strongly upon the point, and I beg you to believe that the words I have just now read were by no means intended by me as a sop to the Cerberus of culture. I have not been in the habit of offering sops to any kind of Cerberus; but it was an expression of profound conviction on my own part--a conviction forced upon me not only by my mental constitution, but by the lessons of what is now becoming a somewhat long experience of varied conditions of life.|$|E

30|$|B: About you said, some {{students}} read fewer books; {{because they said}} they have no time, {{and they have a}} lot attractive do after class. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you read <b>the</b> paper books at the library or you buy some books, it will waste you some time....|$|R
60|$|Therein {{lies the}} promise that this {{monopoly}} is going to extend its commerce wide in <b>the</b> earth. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> business were conducted in the loose and disconnected fashion customary with such things, it would achieve but {{little more than the}} modest prosperity usually secured by unorganised great moral and commercial ventures; but I believe that so long as this one remains compactly organised and closely concentrated in a Trust, the spread of its dominion will continue.|$|R

5000|$|Actor Stephen Tompkinson {{said of the}} series, [...] "In Deep is a very gritty {{drama and}} {{not the kind of}} thing that I'm {{normally}} associated with. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> audience are expecting Ballykissangel or Grafters they're in for a surprise. This is not just another police show, it was seat of the pants stuff for us and the dramatic possibilities are endless." [...] Tompkinson also commented on the work of real life undercover police officers. [...] "There's only about 30 of these officers in this country, and they've got no fixed abode and no safety net when things go wrong. It's terrifying really. They're always acting, pretending to be somebody else. I found that fascinating that here was a real job with lives at risk, but where they act all the time. So In Deep is sort of a drama within a drama." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{possibility}} of an eleventh Testament studio album was first mentioned about {{a week before the}} release of Dark Roots of Earth, when vocalist Chuck Billy stated that Testament would not take [...] "huge gaps" [...] between albums anymore, and would [...] "work hard and tour for two years or so," [...] and try to release another album when they could. Guitarist Eric Peterson added, [...] "There's definitely some politics in the band now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> record does good — which I think it will — it'll see Testament be doing another record. There's some people in the band that are, you know, I think aren't a hundred percent there unless, you know, it keeps going good. That's pretty extreme, but, like for me, I'm down for whatever. I started the band, I'm totally into it. This is what I do. I think, you know, if Testament sees darker days, I don't know if this lineup would stick." [...] Testament spent most of 2012 and 2013 touring in support of Dark Roots of Earth, including supporting Anthrax and Death Angel on the Worship Music tour, and headlining their own U.S. tour, with support from Overkill, Flotsam and Jetsam and 4ARM. 2013 also saw the release of a live DVD/double album from Testament Dark Roots of Thrash, which documents the band's sold-out headlining performance at the Paramount in Huntington, New York in February 2013.|$|E
40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} a recent paper in your journal, in which three consciousness assessment scales were compared in poisoned patients and finally a new scale "AVPU plus" was proposed (1). The study was very interesting with a worthy objective. I would like to admire the authors for exploring how the Alert/Verbal/Painful/Unresponsive (AVPU) responsive scale corresponds with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores in drug-poisoned patients, and for proposing an augmented AVPU scale. The GCS was developed by Teasdale and Jennet in 1974 (2), aimed at standardizing assessment of level of consciousness in head trauma victims (3). The AVPU scale has been developed for rapid neurologic assessment of  traumatic patients and for those in need of advanced life support (1, 4). RASS has been developed to assess agitation-sedation status of critical patients {{in intensive care unit}} (5, 6). Because there has been no standardized unified method for assessment of consciousness impairment in patients with drug and chemical poisoning, physicians have used different methods or scales in different medical settings. Therefore, developing a research-based scale that is agreed among most medical toxicologists seems necessary. My colleagues and I usually use the AVPU scale in our routine practice. Nonetheless, looking at this newly proposed scale, we believe using AVPU plus for poisoned patients in emergency setting or clinical toxicology ward would be helpful and practical. As a recommendation, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> grading of AVPU plus is scaled in numerical instead of alphabetical, {{it would be easier to}} use...|$|E
