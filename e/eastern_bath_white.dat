50|$|The Forum Baths, {{constructed}} {{on the east}} and west of the nymphaeum, and north and northeast of the forum, were constructed in the early-4th century following the final renovation of the nymphaeum.

The <b>eastern</b> <b>baths</b> were arranged around a central corridor which opened onto a sudatorium, a caldarium, and a tepidarium to the north. The western baths possessed a series of axially aligned baths along the northwest wall of the nymphaeum.|$|R

Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the <b>bath</b> <b>white</b> (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor, Anax imperator and the scarlet darter, Crocothemis erythraea can be found. The islands sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large Eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the striking blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} 2004-08 surveys {{focussing}} on insects registered {{a total of}} 345 beetle species, 421 species of butterflies and 18 species of bees.

The population of butterflies seems peculiarly skewed towards regionally uncommon or rare species, including Epiblema grandaevana (a species of moth) and <b>Bath</b> <b>White</b> (Pontia daplidice). In 2005 the poisonous Hobo spider was discovered here, a spider that is only regionally known from a certain spot in Jutland. It is thought of as having migrated here by trains from abroad.

40|$|We {{construct}} a theory for the 1 + 1 -dimensional Brownian motion in a viscous medium, which is (i) consistent with Einstein's theory of special relativity, and (ii) reduces {{to the standard}} Brownian motion in the Newtonian limit case. In {{the first part of}} this work the classical Langevin equations of motion, governing the nonrelativistic dynamics of a free Brownian particle in the presence of a heat <b>bath</b> (<b>white</b> noise), are generalized in the framework of special relativity. Subsequently, the corresponding relativistic Langevin equations are discussed in the context of the generalized Ito (pre-point discretization rule) vs. the Stratonovich (mid-point discretization rule) dilemma: It is found that the relativistic Langevin equation in the Haenggi-Klimontovich interpretation (with the post-point discretization rule) is the only one that yields agreement with the relativistic Maxwell distribution. Numerical results for the relativistic Langevin equation of a free Brownian particle are presented. Comment: see cond-mat/ 0607082 for an improved theor...|$|R

50|$|The Cowpasture {{rises in}} northeastern Highland County and flows {{generally}} southwestwardly, initially between Bullpasture Mountain and Shaws Ridge {{through a narrow}} valley floor near the George Washington National Forest. It is joined in eastern Highland County by Shaws Fork and gains breadth but has little depth. At Summers Mountain (a high point along Bullpasture Mountain) the river passes through a narrow gorge before entering a broad valley in Bath County, where at the community of Williamsville it collects the Bullpasture River, which greatly adds to its volume. For 20 mi from this confluence the Cowpasture is joined by many small streams, and flows in increasingly wide bends in <b>eastern</b> <b>Bath</b> County. Downstream {{of the community of}} Millboro Springs the river becomes deep enough for year-round boating; there are several boat launch sites along the river in <b>Bath</b> County. In <b>eastern</b> Alleghany County the Cowpasture is joined by Simpson Creek and shortly enters Botetourt County, where it joins the Jackson River to form the James River near the town of Iron Gate.|$|R

40|$|We {{review a}} family of models {{recently}} introduced to describe Brownian motors {{under the influence of}} Coulomb friction, or more general non-linear friction laws. It is known that, if the heat bath is modeled as the usual Langevin equation (linear viscosity plus white noise), additional non-linear friction forces are not sufficient to break detailed balance, i. e. cannot produce a motor effect. We discuss two possibile mechanisms to elude this problem. A first possibility, exploited in several models inspired to recent experiments, is to replace the heat <b>bath's</b> <b>white</b> noise by a ``collisional noise'', that is the effect of random collisions with an external equilibrium gas of particles. A second possibility is enlarging the phase space, e. g. by adding an external potential which couples velocity to position, as in a Klein-Kramers equation. In both cases, non-linear friction becomes sufficient to achieve a non-equilibrium steady state and, in the presence of an even small spatial asymmetry, a motor effect is produced.

50|$|However, {{excavations}} {{proved that}} life in Delphi continued to thrive {{even after the}} closing of the oracle. On the contrary, it seems that the city continued to prosper for three more centuries. During the Great Excavation were discovered architectural members from a 5th-century Christian basilica, when Delphi were a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Baths,</b> the house with the peristyle, the Roman Agora, the large cistern usw. At {{the outskirts of the city}} there were located late Roman cemeteries. To the Southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a very large building with a 65 meters-long façade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the Delphi Archaeological Museum. The mansion dates to the beginning of the 5th century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potters' workshop. It is only then, in the beginning of the 6th century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished. Local pottery production is produced in large quantities: it is coarser and made of reddish clay, aiming at satisfying the needs of the inhabitants.|$|R

The present survey was conducted to determine the biology and distribution of butterfly fauna of Hazara University, Garden Campus, Mansehra, Pakistan during March-June 2012. The study area was divided into 3 quadrates, i. e., residential area, administration area and main campus. A total of 170 specimens were collected, 10 species were identified belonging to 3 different families and falling in 8 genera. The species were identified. The painted lady, Cynthia cardui (Linnaeus); blue pansy, Junonia orithya Linnaeus; and plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus (Linnaeus) were belonging to family Nymphalidae. The lime butterfly, Papilio demoleus Linnaeus and com-mon mormon, P. polytes Linnaeus were belonging to family Papilionidae.
