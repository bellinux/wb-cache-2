5|$|The comet was {{discovered}} <b>independently</b> on July 23, 1995 by two observers, Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, {{both in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest examples of convergent evolution. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to converge on equivalent solutions <b>independently</b> and repeatedly.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of graphite was solved in 1916 by the related method of powder diffraction, which {{was developed by}} Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer and, <b>independently,</b> by Albert Hull in 1917. The {{structure of}} graphite was determined from single-crystal diffraction in 1924 by two groups <b>independently.</b> Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of various metals, such as iron and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The two river navigations {{were built}} <b>independently</b> of one another, {{in order to}} meet local needs, but they {{eventually}} led to plans to connect them and form a through route.|$|E

5|$|BWI. Athletes from Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago competed as the British West Indies (BWI) at the 1960 Games. The West Indies Federation only existed as {{a nation}} from 1958–1962, so the {{constituent}} nations once again competed <b>independently</b> in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx <b>independently,</b> allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|But the dealing by {{the general}} {{government}} with the Indian tribes through treaties was resorted to as a convenient mode of regulating Indian affairs, and not because, as with other nations, {{it was the only}} mode, <b>independently</b> of the arbitrament of war, of dealing with them.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{research}} in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey {{confirmed that the}} separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these {{should be regarded as}} separate subspecies and that they are evolving <b>independently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Have been bred by French active member-associates of the HBL. The {{strictly}} enforced {{rules of}} the HBL require breeders to conduct on-farm performance testing of their animals and to have selected animals <b>independently</b> tested by approved official bodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics <b>independently</b> {{concluded}} that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d.|$|E

5|$|<b>Independently</b> of the ANSI committee, the CODASYL Programming Language Committee {{was working}} on {{improving}} the language.

5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the echolocation vocalizations {{do not agree with}} evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and <b>independently</b> to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential. It would be futile {{for people to}} approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law <b>independently.</b> Moreover, people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly.|$|E
