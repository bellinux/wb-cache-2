5|$|Lara {{returns to}} the {{survivors}} on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud {{states that}} there are three methods of {{performing}} erusin; by handing the woman a coin or object of nominal value, by <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> a document and through consummation (sexual intercourse), although the last is prohibited by the Talmud. In all cases the woman's consent is required; however, it can be implied by her silence. In religious law, two valid witnesses must see the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|In December 1992, McEntire's seventeenth studio album, It's Your Call, was released. It {{became her}} first album to peak within the Billboard 200 Top 10, {{reaching}} No. 8. McEntire {{commented that the}} record was a [...] "second chapter" [...] to For My Broken Heart, while music reviewers such as Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, writing, [...] "In truth, it isn't nearly as pessimistic as its predecessor—and unfortunately it isn't anywhere as involving." [...] Nash called the album's title track—which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart—"one of those moment-of-truth sagas at which McEntire excels. In the song, a wife answers the phone to find her husband's girlfriend {{on the other end}} and seizes the opportunity not only to inform her mate that she knows of his affair but to give him the ultimatum of choosing between the two. She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line, she sings, <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> husband the phone. It's your call." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gleason {{worked his}} way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where {{insulting}} its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> an ice cube and saying, [...] "Okay, now do something." [...] It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for $250 a week.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{not much}} was {{heard from her}} in the spring, the second album was highly anticipated. Two days before the {{announced}} release date, she was interviewed on Nyhetsmorgon, a morning talk show, on TV4. The host surprised her by <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> a gold record for the album; it had already sold enough copies on pre-orders alone to be certified."Don't Cry Your Heart Out" [...] was a radio hit in Sweden.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{conflicting}} accounts, she {{was simply}} allowed to go free, or detained at Malmaison prison before her declining health made the authorities commit her to Nicolae Gh. Lupu's clinic, ultimately assigning her house arrest in a Bucharest lodging she shared with her mother. She lacked the means to support herself, and was cared for by her friends and family. After his People's Court trial and just prior to his June 1946 execution for war crimes, Ion Antonescu met his wife one final time, <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> his watch with the request that she imagine [...] "it is my heart beating", and never let it stop.|$|E

He regrets this decision, however, and returns to rescue Helena. He is very proud of his tower, though he mentions {{that he had an}} argument with it and that they parted ways. As he and Helena are being pursued by the Queen of Shadows, he calls the tower to aid their escape by shouting an apology to it. When Helena reawakens in her world, she meets him again auditioning as a juggler for the circus.|$|E

2500|$|The Residents {{recorded}} the dramatic album Demons Dance Alone (also a tour and DVD in 2002) and Animal Lover in 2005. Singer Molly Harvey {{began as a}} Ralph employee but by the mid-90s contributed to {{virtually all of the}} Residents' many projects. The Residents' increased reliance on Harvey, essentially <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> half of the vocal duties since at least Demons Dance Alone, parallels their artistic revitalization. Nolan Cook, Carla Fabrizio, Toby Dammit, Eric Drew Feldman, and many other artists continuously worked with the band over the last five years, recording and performing live. The new artists helped to counter what Allmusic derided as a [...] "sonic palette [...] factory presets from their new Macintosh audio" [...] of the CD-ROM era.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disposition}} of U-570 was initially uncertain. Winston Churchill was {{in favour of}} <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> over to the Americans for repair, both for propaganda and {{as a means of}} deepening then-neutral America's engagement in the Battle of the Atlantic. The Americans were eager to have her, but the Royal Navy objected both to this and to Churchill's other idea-to have her serve in the Mediterranean with a Yugoslav crew. Instead, she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Graph on 19 September 1941, and assigned the Royal Navy pennant number P715. She was given a name beginning with a 'G' to signify German, i.e., denoting that Graph was a captured vessel. The name Graph was also chosen owing to the extensive testing carried out on her (and therefore the many [...] "Graphs" [...] drawn up), but was also a play on the German word Graf meaning [...] "Count".|$|E
2500|$|The west-facing {{pediment}} {{on southern}} library shows Śiva again {{seated on the}} summit of Mount Kailāsa. He is looking to his left at the god of love Kāma, who is aiming an arrow at him. [...] Umā sits to Śiva's right; he is <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> a chain of beads. The slopes of the mountain are crowded with other beings, again arranged in a strict hierarchy from top to bottom. Just under Śiva sits a group of bearded wise men and ascetics, under whom the second tier is occupied by the mythological beings with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans; the lowest tier belongs the common people, who mingle sociably with tame deer and a large gentle bull. According to the legend, Kāma fired an arrow at Śiva in order to cause Śiva to {{take an interest in}} Umā. Śiva, however, was greatly angered by this provocation, and punished Kāma by gazing upon him with his third eye, frying Kāma to cinders.|$|E

2500|$|The {{residents}} of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for {{shelter from the}} hurricane. They drown out {{the sound of the}} storm with prayers and hymns ("Oh, Doctor Jesus") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day. Clara desperately sings her lullaby ("Summertime" [...] ). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death ("Oh there's somebody knocking at the door"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. ("A red-headed woman"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves [...] "Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!" [...] The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a two-month}} hiatus, Kane {{returned}} at Hell in a Cell on October 27, attacking both The Wyatt Family and The Miz. The next night on Raw, Kane turned heel {{again as he}} pledged allegiance to Stephanie McMahon by <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> his mask, and reinforced his loyalty the next week by aiding members of The Authority. As part of his character change, he appeared unmasked and wore {{a suit and tie}} to fit in with the corporate ideology of The Authority, and was given a fictional role as [...] "Director of Operations". Kane participated in the 2014 Royal Rumble, and was eliminated by CM Punk. He re-appeared later during the match, eliminating Punk to tie the record for most eliminations in the Royal Rumble match; however, his thirteen-year-old record for most eliminations in a single Rumble was broken by Roman Reigns. Kane then involved himself in The Authority's feud with Daniel Bryan, which included Kane booking himself in a match with Bryan on the February 17 episode of Raw and interfering in the Elimination Chamber match between Bryan and Randy Orton at Elimination Chamber.|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a September 2010 {{interview}} from the prison, Van der Sloot admitted to extorting Twitty, stating: [...] "I {{wanted to get}} back at Natalee's family — her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On September 11, Twitty traveled to Peru with Peter R. De Vries and his Dutch television crew to visit the prison. According to Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, his client was taken [...] "practically by force" [...] to a meeting with Twitty that took [...] "less than one minute." [...] Altez Navarro said that when Twitty asked questions about the disappearance of her daughter, Van der Sloot responded by saying that he could not speak to her without his lawyer present and <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> his lawyer's business card. Altez Navarro claimed that Twitty was [...] "snuck" [...] into the prison without being identified by the Dutch media crew who she was with. A prison spokesperson stated that Twitty's name was not found in the visitor registry. [...] Colonel Abel Gamarra of the Peruvian National Police stated that no arrests had been made. Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly commented, [...] "I know she didn't tell me ahead of time because I would have asked her to exercise a little more caution." [...] While in Peru, Twitty spoke with Flores's brother Enrique on camera. On September 17, Holloway and the group left the country for Panama and arrived in Aruba on the same day. Twitty spent a few days in Aruba working with De Vries on a documentary about her missing daughter to be run on Dutch television, reportedly with the cooperation of prosecutors who had been investigating Van der Sloot. The video premiered in November 2010 on SBS6 in the Netherlands and as a special episode of 48 Hours on CBS in the United States, resulting in the suspension of Miguel Castro Castro prison warden Alex Samamé Peña.|$|E
