The project aims to help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide.|$|E
500|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Richardson prefaced {{the novel by}} claiming to be merely the editor, saying, [...] "How such remarkable collections of private letters fell into the editor's hand <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>the</b> reader will not think it very necessary to enquire". [...] However, Richardson did not keep his authorship secret and, on the prompting of his friends like Samuel Johnson, dropped this framing device from the second edition.|$|E

Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating that <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>the</b> show will reconsider {{the next time}} they decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, it was nice to see Lurleen again, but she'd probably get more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Legendary Television {{bought the}} rights to adapt Lazarus {{following}} a competitive bidding war in March 2015. Rucka and Lark will be executive producers along with David Manpearl and Matt Tolmach.

Speaking in New York on March 5, 2012, Mukasey said his comments in 2008 were taken out of context. His [...] "martyr" [...] comment was a humorous reason offered as the only reason not to seek the death penalty. He then said if the detainees were found guilty, they should be executed in the due process of the law and not make an exception.|$|E
2500|$|J. Cole {{said there}} is a lot he wants to do that he didn't get to do on his last album because the label didn't know {{that he was going to}} come out and have the number-one album in the country so this time <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>the</b> {{promotion}} effort is way bigger. He plans to shoot a short film to accompany the album as well as multiple music videos. In promotion of the album Cole released several Born Sinner vlogs, the first video spotlighted Cole's mother and her former job of working at the post office, and her retirement. The second video spotlighted friend and frequent collaborator Kendrick Lamar. In the video he discusses his earliest musical influences and his work ethic. On June 6, 2013, J. Cole held one time listen sessions for the album in various places throughout North America. The following day the album leaked in full online via various peer-to-peer file sharing websites. Rather than go into crisis mode and attempt to remove it from online, Cole put the album up for a limited time free stream. Cole and Nas released [...] "Let Nas Down (Remix)" [...] on June 22, 2013. The remix was named one of the best songs of the first half of 2013 by Complex. On July 29, 2013, Cole announced What Dreams May Come Tour with fellow rapper Wale.|$|E

[...] 140 Our plenteous streams a various race supply, The bright-eyed perch with fins of Tyrian dye, The silver eel, in shining volumes roll'd, The yellow carp, in scales bedropp'd with gold, Swift trouts, diversified with crimson stains, And pikes, the tyrants of the watery plains.|$|E

6000|$|With the {{exception}} of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of Don Juan, The Island was the last poem of any importance which Byron lived to write, and the question naturally suggests itself--Is the new song as good as the old? Byron answers the question himself. He tells Leigh Hunt (January 25, 1823) that <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>the</b> [...] "poem will be a little above the ordinary run of periodical poesy," [...] and that, though portions of the Toobonai (sic) islanders are [...] "pamby," [...] he intends [...] "to scatter some uncommon places here and there nevertheless." [...] On the whole, in point of conception and execution, The Island is weaker and less coherent than the Corsair; but it contains lines and passages (e.g. Canto I. lines 107-124, 133-140; Canto II. lines 272-297; Canto IV. lines 94-188) which display a finer feeling and a more [...] "exalted wit" [...] than the [...] "purple patches" [...] of The Turkish Tales.|$|E

Hows'ever, it warn't paid, and so they cuts the water off.

Upon this, the women calls a meetin', sings a hymn, wotes your mother-in-law into the chair, wolunteers a collection next Sunday, and hands it all over to the shepherd. And if he ain't got enough out on 'em, Sammy, to make him free of the water company for life,' said Mr. Weller, in conclusion, 'I'm one Dutchman, and you're another, and that's all about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have said}} [...] "by one night's work," [...] but, in truth, {{it was by}} two nights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly {{three o'clock in the}} morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we {{determined}} to try again. The next night we lowered the lamp, and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which <b>he</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>the</b> game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair, when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs, with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.|$|E
