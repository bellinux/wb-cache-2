5|$|The Shrewsbury Folk Festival {{has been}} held in Shrewsbury since 2006. Held {{annually}} over the August bank holiday, the event is very popular, with people travelling from across the UK to attend. In 2006 much of the event {{was held in the}} Quarry, with other related festivities <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> the town. Shrewsbury is also home to one of the region's main agricultural shows – the Shropshire County Show (formerly the West Mid Show). This is held every year, usually in May, at the West Mid Showground {{on the outskirts of town}} at Coton Hill.|$|E
5|$|Police Squads opening {{sequence}} {{was based}} on the 1950s show M Squad, which starred Lee Marvin, which opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The Hank Simms voice-over and the show's organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including The Fugitive, The Streets of San Francisco, Barnaby Jones, The F.B.I., and Cannon. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> him. Although the show lasted only six episodes Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.|$|E

30|$|The next {{spontaneous}} event <b>happens</b> <b>around</b> time 0.5. Recall {{that around}} time 0.3 the molecule type 111 came into existence, {{but for the}} green reaction to become {{an extension of the}} blue subRAF, it will still need to happen uncatalyzed at least once (given that it is catalyzed by its own product). However, when this <b>happens</b> (<b>around</b> time 0.5), the concentration of its product type 01111 (green line), supported by a product of the blue subRAF, immediately starts to grow rapidly. Finally, a last required spontaneous event <b>happens</b> <b>around</b> time 0.55, when molecule type 1010 is created, which then gives rise to the red subRAF coming into full existence (given that the purple irrRAF it contains was already present).|$|R

25|$|Commentators such as Leo Strauss {{have gone}} so far as to name Machiavelli as the {{deliberate}} originator of modernity itself.

The Littlehampton College also hosts 'Roddick Days' such as 'Day of Action' and 'One World'; these events allow students to give something back to their local community and learn about what is <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> them.|$|E
25|$|War Horse is a 2011 American war drama film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay written by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, adapted from English author Michael Morpurgo's 1982 {{novel of the}} same name. The film's cast includes Jeremy Irvine (in his film acting debut), Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Marsan, Niels Arestrup, Toby Kebbell, David Kross and Peter Mullan.

25|$|The first {{published}} causal {{explanation of the}} motions of planets was Johannes Kepler's Astronomia nova published in 1609. He concluded, based on Tycho Brahe's observations of the orbit of Mars, that the orbits were ellipses. This break with ancient thought was <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> {{the same time that}} Galileo was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the tower of Pisa, showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of this experiment is disputed, but, more importantly, he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an inclined plane. His theory of accelerated motion derived from the results of such experiments, and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways of the people around him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Holocaust Teichtal changed his {{position}} on Israel as he struggled to make meaning out of what was <b>happening</b> <b>around</b> him. His carefully constructed arguments are outlined in his book Eim Habanim Semeichah penned during his wanderings in hiding from his Nazi oppressors and their collaborators. In that work, first published in 1943, he makes a case for the rebuilding of the land of Israel bringing about the ultimate redemption. In this respect his work had a precursor in the works of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. His original view had been that of the majority in the Hungarian Orthodox Jewish world at the time, which discouraged an active movement for a return of Jews to Israel. The prevalent view at that time was that God would bring about a return without the need of human mechanizations. The Holocaust caused him to re-think this approach, and he therefore {{came to the conclusion that}} the reason that the Jewish people had not been redeemed, was because they had not returned to their homeland, the land of Israel, to resettle and rebuild it to its former glory.|$|E

Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe {{that a man who}} understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony.

In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect [...] "but for two things: status and stomach.
