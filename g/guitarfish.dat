5|$|Usually {{found near}} the sea floor, the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> prefers sandy or muddy areas near {{underwater}} structures. It is a strong-swimming predator of bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. This species gives live birth to litters {{of two to}} eleven pups, which are nourished during gestation by yolk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> as Vulnerable because it is widely caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries for its valuable fins and meat. It {{is viewed as a}} nuisance by trawlers, however, because its bulk and thorny skin cause it to damage netted catches. Habitat degradation and destruction pose an additional, significant challenge to this ray's survival. The bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|Encountered singly or in groups, the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> {{feeds on}} small, benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing sustenance from a yolk sac. Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> under Least Concern {{because the majority of}} its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species in Mexican waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth <b>guitarfish.</b> The ray is {{protected}} by the thorns on its head and back, and it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the trematode Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus).|$|E
50|$|Wedgefishes are rays of {{the family}} Rhinidae, {{comprising}} ten species in three genera. Classified in the order Rhinopristiformes along with <b>guitarfishes</b> and sawfishes, they have also been known as giant <b>guitarfishes</b> or sharkfin <b>guitarfishes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{flattened}} {{pectoral fin}} discs of fiddler rays are shorter and more rounded {{than those of}} other <b>guitarfishes.</b> Their tails are slender, with a well-developed caudal fin and two triangular dorsal fins. Their snouts are translucent. The fiddler rays are also distinguished from other <b>guitarfishes</b> in that the anterior nasal flaps of their nostrils are expanded backwards and fused together into a nasal curtain that reaches the mouth.|$|R
5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> can {{be readily}} {{approached}} underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E
5|$|The thornback <b>guitarfish</b> was scientifically {{described}} by American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in an 1880 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum. They assigned it to the genus Platyrhina, and named it triseriata from the Latin tres ("three") and series ("row"), {{in reference to the}} three rows of thorns on its back. One year later in the same journal, Samuel Garman placed this species in a newly created genus, Platyrhinoidis. The type specimen is an adult male caught off Santa Barbara on February 8, 1880. Other common names for this species include banjo shark (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian banjo sharks, Trygonorrhina), California thornback, <b>guitarfish,</b> round skate, shovelnose, thornback, and thornback ray.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable {{due to their}} use in shark fin soup, and are often the only parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in trawls, the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> is considered a nuisance because its strength and rough skin {{make it difficult to}} handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes in the net it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets.|$|E
50|$|The Platyrhinidae are {{a family}} of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, {{commonly}} known as thornbacks due to their dorsal rows of large thorns. They resemble <b>guitarfishes</b> in shape, but are in fact {{more closely related to}} stingrays.|$|R
50|$|Rhinobatos is a genus {{of fish in}} the Rhinobatidae family. Although {{previously}} used {{to encompass}} all <b>guitarfishes,</b> it {{was found to be}} polyphyletic, and recent authorities have transferred many species included in the genus to Acroteriobatus, Glaucostegus, and Pseudobatos.|$|R
50|$|Glaucostegus, {{also known}} as giant <b>guitarfishes,</b> is a genus of large Indo-Pacific rays, with a single species, G. cemiculus, in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. They were {{formerly}} classified in the family Rhinobatidae but are now recognized as a distinct family, Glaucostegidae.|$|R
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|The bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on {{demersal}} bony fishes such as croakers and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two bowmouth guitarfishes examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
50|$|Gymnura {{is derived}} from Greek roots and {{translates}} into 'naked tail'. They belong to a monophyletic group of Batoid fish. This group contains over 500 other elasmobranch fishes which includes electric rays, sawfishes, <b>guitarfishes,</b> skates, and stingrays. They {{are a part of}} Order Myliobatiformes and are characterized by their pectoral fins being widely expanded and fused to their heads. The family Gymnuridae contains 2 genera which encompass 12 different species.|$|R
25|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have confirmed}} the urolophids and related taxa {{belong to the}} order Myliobatiformes; they were once placed in the order Rajiformes with the <b>guitarfishes</b> and skates. Based on morphological characters, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman determined in a 2004 study that the urolophids formed a clade with the giant stingaree (Plesiobatis daviesi), and that the two were basal to a clade containing all other myliobatiform families except Platyrhinidae, Hexatrygonidae, and Zanobatidae. They proposed including Plesiobatis in the family Urolophidae, and classifying the family within the superfamily Urolophoidea within Myliobatiformes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{primary means}} by which fish {{generate}} thrust is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large tail fin. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from pectoral fins (or front limbs in marine mammals). [...] Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) and batiform fish (electric rays, sawﬁshes, <b>guitarﬁshes,</b> skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed labriform swimming. [...] Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.|$|R
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, <b>guitarfish,</b> skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and <b>guitarfish.</b> This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|E
50|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have confirmed}} the urolophids and related taxa {{belong to the}} order Myliobatiformes; they were once placed in the order Rajiformes with the <b>guitarfishes</b> and skates.

5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, <b>guitarfishes,</b> stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|R
50|$|Fiddler rays feed on bottoms shellfish, crabs, and worms, {{which they}} crush between their jaws. The eastern fiddler ray {{is known to}} {{scavenge}} from fish traps. Like other <b>guitarfishes,</b> fiddler rays are ovoviviparous. The egg capsules of the southern fiddler ray are reported to be golden in colour, containing three embryos each. It gives birth to litters of four to six young per breeding cycle. Fiddler rays are harmless and easily approached by divers. Southern fiddler rays are taken as bycatch by commercial trawlers and by recreational fishers; the flesh is of good quality and sold in small quantities.The Magpie fiddler ray (previously Trygonorrhina melaleuca) is now considered a variant of Trygonorrhina dumerilii.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
500|$|During the day, the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> {{spends much}} time {{partially}} buried in sediment. It may be encountered singly, in small groups, or in large aggregations that form seasonally in particular bays and sloughs. The diet of this ray consists of polychaete worms, crustaceans (including crabs, shrimps, and isopods), squids, and small bony fishes (including anchovies, sardines, gobies, sculpins, and surfperches). It can detect prey with its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini, which are most sensitive to electric fields with a frequency of 5–15 Hz. In turn, the thornback <b>guitarfish</b> is preyed upon by sharks {{and the northern}} elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Echinobothrium californiense and the nematode Proleptus acutus. Thornback <b>guitarfish</b> mate in late summer, and females give birth the following year at around the same time, peaking in August. It is aplacental viviparous, with developing embryos sustained until birth by yolk.|$|E
500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> as Vulnerable. It {{is threatened by}} fishing and by habitat destruction and degradation, particularly from blast fishing, coral bleaching, and siltation. Its numbers {{are known to have}} declined substantially in Indonesian waters, where {{it is one of the}} large rays targeted by a mostly unregulated gillnet fishery. The IUCN has given this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened in Australian waters, where it is not a targeted species but is taken as bycatch in bottom trawls. The installation of turtle excluder devices on some Australian trawlers has benefited this species. Since it is rare and faces many conservation threats, the bowmouth <b>guitarfish</b> has been called [...] "the panda of the aquatic world".|$|E
50|$|Asterotrygon {{and other}} organisms from the Green River Formation lived in {{subtropical}} lakes in a mountainous region. These lakes existed {{for a very}} long time, some up to 15 million years. The oldest modern lakes have existed for only a few million years, and the vast majority only a few thousand. Three major lakes are known: Fossil Lake, Lake Gosiute, and Lake Uinta. Although it was the shortest-lived, Fossil Lake preserved the most fossils, including all stingray fossils. Fossil Lake is one of two areas that preserve complete stingray fossils; the other, the Monte Bolca Formation in Italy, preserves stingrays that lived in a marine lagoon behind a coral reef. Monte Bolca preserves a greater diversity of rays, including <b>guitarfishes</b> and electric rays. More rays may have lived in Monte Bolca because it was a marine environment; today, most stingrays live in the ocean and only a few live in fresh water.|$|R
40|$|Elasmobranchs {{comprising}} sharks, skates, <b>guitarfishes</b> and rays {{have attracted}} increased attention {{in recent years}} both from research and conservation points of view. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute has been collecting landing statistics and making estimates of production {{for the past five}} decades. Besides, the Institute has also been collecting data on biological characteristics of some species from selected landing centres. However, the knowledge on these resources has not so far been consolidated, mainly owing to lack of adequate information on individual species contributing to the fishery and the various aspects of their biology. Globally, however, increased concerns are expressed on the sustainability of the elasmobranch fisheries while some countries have even harmed the exploitation of certain species. It was therefore felt desirable first to consolidate the data and knowledge available from the Indian EEZ on the status of elasmobranch fishery so that suitable action plans could be formulated for research, development and conservation. This process was initiated about two years ago and now we are ready with the results of the voluminous data processed and consolidate...|$|R
5000|$|Batoids are flat-bodied, and, like sharks, are {{cartilaginous}} marine fish, {{meaning they}} have a boneless skeleton made of a tough, elastic substance. Most batoids have five ventral slot-like body openings called gill slits that lead from the gills, but the Hexatrygonidae have six. Batoid gill slits lie under the pectoral fins on the underside, whereas a shark's are {{on the sides of}} the head. Most batoids have a flat, disk-like body, with the exception of the <b>guitarfishes</b> and sawfishes, while most sharks have a spindle-shaped body. Many species of batoid have developed their pectoral fins into broad flat wing-like appendages. The anal fin is absent. The eyes and spiracles are located on top of the head. Batoids have a ventrally located mouth and can considerably protrude their upper jaw (palatoquadrate cartilage) away from the cranium to capture prey. [...] The jaws have euhyostylic type suspension, which relies completely on the hyomandibular cartilages for support. [...] Bottom-dwelling batoids breathe by taking water in through the spiracles, rather than through the mouth as most fishes do, and passing it outward through the gills.|$|R

500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and <b>guitarfishes)</b> and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|R

40|$|The genus Acanthobothrium assembles {{a set of}} {{cosmopolitan}} onchobothriid tapeworms parasites of elasmobranchs. Despite {{its clear}} diagnostic features, which include a scolex with four bothridia each bearing three loculi {{and a pair of}} bipronged hooks, this genus is represented by species that possess a diversity of morphologies and host lineages (e. g. rays, skates, <b>guitarfishes,</b> and sharks; Campbell & Beveridge 2002; Zschoche et al. 2011). The wide distribution of this genus, its diverse morphology, and, perhaps most importantly, its lengthy and complex taxonomic history likely account for the fact that, to date, the absolute number of valid species, of potentially more than 200 nominal species, cannot be assigned to the genus with certainty. Clearly, a taxonomic revision of this group is overdue; a task that certainly will only be accomplished by collaborative efforts of cestodologists around the globe, given the widespread distribution of its species and the necessity of collecting new material to verify host identities and morphology in many cases. It is not our purpose here to provide such a revision. However, {{in order to get the}} basis for such a task, it is our intention to clarify the authorship, date of publication, type species, and type host of Acanthobothrium.
