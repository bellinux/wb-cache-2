40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the growth and vegetable pod yield of <b>edible</b> <b>podded</b> <b>pea</b> as influenced by sowing time and spacing. The experiment consisted of two factors, which were three sowing times and six plant spacings. The results revealed that Nov. 23 sown plants showed higher leaf area index, leaf, stem and pod dry matter, plant height and vegetable pod yield than those of Nov. 8 and Dec. 8 sowing. Closest spacing produced the highest LAI, leaf, stem and pod dry matter, crop growth rate, plant height and vegetable pod yield. However, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate were the highest in widest spacing. Regardless of variation in sowing time and spacing, LAI, leaf and stem dry matter, CGR, RGR and NAR increased sharply up to 60 DAE and then declined but pod dry matter increased thereafter. Moreover, plant height increased rapidly up to 60 DAE and then slowly. The highest vegetable pod yield (10. 26 t ha - 1 ) was recorded from the Nov. 23 sowing with 30 x 20 cm 2 spacing...|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{management}} for diabetic patients based on selection of low available carbohydrate foods {{has been criticized}} because the same availability of carbohydrate in different foods may result in different degree of glycemic response. This management is now being corrected by additional aid in selecting foods with the glycemic index (GI) of foods. GI {{is a measure of}} the glycemic response to the carbohydrate component within a food relative to the response to an equal carbohydrate portion of reference food (glucose or white bread). In Indonesia, data of the glycemic index of foods is still very limited. The objectives of the research are to provide GI of selected legumes, including red bean (Vigna umbellata), Mung bean (Phaseolus aureus), cow pea (Vigna sinensis ENDL), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan MILLSPAUGH), edible podded peas (Pisum sativum LINN) and soy bean (Glycine max MERR). Eleventh health and normal volunteers (not diabetic) were provided. The volunteers took an overnight fasting, blood were drawn in the morning and analyzed for serum glucose. Then they were given the test legumes containing total carbohydrates equivalent to 25 -g glucose to be consumed.

The objectives {{of this research}} were to investigate {{the effects of these}} legumes on serum glucose, total cholesterol and triacyl glycerol in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (250 - 300 g) were provided and divided into three groups of ten rats. They were diabetic induced by twice intramuscular injection of alloxan (80 mg/Kg of body weight), then fed with three different diets i. e. Standard (ST), (2) <b>Edible</b> <b>Podded</b> <b>peas</b> (EP) and Soybean (SB) for 28 days. The legumes provided 20 % calorie of total duet calorie. Concentration of serum glucose, total cholesterol and tracyl glycerol were measured before injection and diet intervention (0 day and day 17 th) and were monitored in the middle {{and at the end of}} diet intervention (day 31 st and 45 th). It was found that alloxan injection increased serum glucose concentration from 63. 5 mg/dL to 281. 4 mg/dL, total cholesterol and triacyl glycerol concentration increased from 90. 7 mg/dL to 136. 6 mg/dL and from 108 mg/dL to 147. 5 mg/dL, respectively.

40|$|Thirty-three edible-pod pea (Pisum sativum L.) lines {{selected}} from single plants within 11 snow pea landraces and three elite cultivars were evaluated for their horticultural value in three field trials at Pontevedra and Lugo (Northwestern Spain). Field performance was estimated according to six traits related to earliness and duration, while horticultural value {{was determined by}} five pod traits. The global pod quality was estimated by a taste panel. Lines showed significant differences in nine quantitative traits. Significant differences were found among means of five landraces and the lines selected within them for pod length, width and weight.

The introduction of pure lines and hybrids with improved length and width into the cropping system, necessitate studies on the combining ability and genetic components for the length and width of pods. Seven parents and 21 F 1 generations were planted for evaluation in a randomized complete block design with two replications.

The estimated variance due to SCA was greater than GCA variance for length and width of <b>pods</b> at <b>edible</b> stage and vice versa for length and width of pod at maturity. The study identified Parents 7, 6, 4 and 5 as best combiners for <b>edible</b> <b>pod</b> length and width, mature pod length and width. Component analysis indicated that the dominant genetic action predominate other genetic effects in the inheritance of length and width of pods.

30|$|The {{following}} conclusions can {{be drawn}} based on the investigation of Ni(II) removal by pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod.</b> The adsorbent prepared from the <b>pod</b> of pigeon <b>pea</b> {{appears to be a}} promising adsorbent for the removal of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution. The study indicated that the pretreated adsorbent produced through chemical activation using NaOH is an effective material for the removal of Ni(II). The maximum removal of Ni(II) is obtained at an alkaline pH of 8.0. It is found from kinetic studies that the adsorption rate of Ni(II) is faster for the initial 20 min, after which it is saturated. The equilibrium time for Ni(II) adsorption on the pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod</b> is obtained at 45 min. Based on the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 19.23 mg g− 1 of adsorbent. Equilibrium studies reveal that the Langmuir model provides better solutions and correlation to the adsorption data when compared with the Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. This suggests that adsorption is limited to the monolayer. The kinetics of biosorption was well represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The data obtained from adsorption isotherms at different temperatures were used to calculate thermodynamic quantities such as ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°. In thermodynamic studies, the positive ΔH° value indicated the endothermic nature of the adsorption interaction, whereas the positive ΔS° value showed the increased randomness at the solid-solution interface during the adsorption process. The negative value of ΔG° indicated the feasibility and spontaneous nature of the adsorption of nickel(II) onto the pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod.</b> The <b>pod</b> of pigeon <b>pea</b> used to produce the adsorbent is a locally and abundantly available agricultural waste product.
