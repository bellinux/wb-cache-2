You can never know by {{trying to find out}} what <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> because <b>it’s</b> {{absolute}} reality. You can only know by finding out what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> So you say, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my body, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my mind, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my organs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my thoughts, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my world, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my universe, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the animals, or the trees, or the moon, or the sun, or the stars, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> any of those things.

40|$|For {{the final}} project I have written an {{alternate}} documentation sys-tem that builds {{on top of}} the current framework and greatly expands the capabilities and usefulness of trying to get help while working at the Julia terminal. The system I created has a standard format for documenting the funnction, which has a Description, Input, Output, two URLs, instruc-tions where to find the source code, a See Also, and unlimited examples. This content is displayed with nice colored formatting in the Julia com-mand line terminal but still needs some work to look more than plain text in IJulia. In this report I show how a documentation entry is created, appended, and displayed. Some issues and proposed improvements are discussed. In conclusion this documentation system might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>goood</b> enough to be used by the Julia community for all time, however since it's much better than what's currently available and it's already working and very fast to use, add, and understand, there is merit in adopting it until the final improved documentation is in place...|$|R
