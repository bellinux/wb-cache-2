25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

500|$|Negative {{reaction}} to the game focused on its length and gameplay. 1UP.com and UGO both considered it short; Shawn Elliott of 1UP.com described it as [...] "a lickety-split run through postcard-pretty tide pools, up cliffs, and into a church turned Combine outpost". UGO's Nigel Grammer stated that Lost Coasts gameplay seemed to be secondary to the level's graphics. Lost Coasts gameplay disappointed Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot, who compared it to that of Half-Life 2 and considered them to be very similar, saying that it [...] "isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the world on fire".|$|E

[...] An ITV spokesman told the paper: [...] "We hired a professional dialect coach to help the actors achieve their Norfolk accent. The Norfolk accent is different in one area of Norfolk to another. What {{we are trying to}} achieve is something that resembles a Norfolk accent that cannot be pinned down." [...] However, he failed to identify any area of Norfolk in which the accent contains a Mummerset [...] "r".|$|E
500|$|British foreign {{minister}} George Canning {{was concerned that}} {{in the event of}} a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. [...] In 1823, he proposed to the American minister to Great Britain, Richard Rush, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. [...] Rush asked for instructions from President James Monroe. The President consulted with his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. [...] Nevertheless, Monroe's Secretary of State, future president John Quincy Adams, felt that if the United States was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain. [...] Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.|$|E

500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'." [...] Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that [...] "'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the Colonial Office {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} deportation, Wallace-Johnson wrote an article entitled [...] "Has the African a God?" [...] in the African Morning Post. In the article, he condemned Christianity, European civilisation and imperialism and told Africans {{to go back to}} worshipping Ethiopia's God. On 6 June 1936, the police arrested Wallace-Johnson and Azikiwe, who had to be forced by the paper's proprietor to print the article, for sedition, in what the Negro Worker called [...] "another dastardly plot intended to smash the Youth League". While he was imprisoned, Wallace-Johnson was told that Governor Hodson would drop the charges against him if he accepted terms for deportation. Wallace-Johnson was suspicious by this unusual gesture, so he questioned why the governor had made such a proposition. Hodson claimed that the government did not have a very good case and that they feared the influence Wallace-Johnson and the WAYL had over the populaces. He finally decided to accept the proposal after the governor offered him Â£100. He feared that the government was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> him up by arresting him for [...] "fleeing justice" [...] after his release. He told authorities to demonstrate their act of good faith by releasing his bail bondsman and providing him with a written statement that he had been freed. The government was reluctant to take such action until Azikiwe pointed out that the government had opened themselves to this dilemma with their initial deportation proposal to Wallace-Johnson. Shortly after, they agreed to Â£50 to Wallace-Johnson, with the promise that the rest would be paid once he arrived in England.|$|E

2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United Statesâ€”between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
