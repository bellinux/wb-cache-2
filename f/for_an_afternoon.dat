Northwestern students also participate in the Freshman Urban Program, a program for students interested in community service. A large and growing number of students participate in the university's Global Engagement Studies Institute (GESI), a group service-learning expedition in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, in conjunction with the Foundation for Sustainable Development. Several internationally recognized non-profit organizations have originated at Northwestern including the World Health Imaging, Informatics and Telemedicine Alliance, a spin-off from an engineering student's honors thesis.|$|E

25|$|On April 21 {{against the}} San Francisco Giants, he hit three {{home runs and}} had six RBI in a single game. In the 3rd inning off Giants pitcher Dom Zanni, Demeter hit the first ever inside-the-park home run at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The next inning saw another home run, this time off Mike McCormick and to deep left. Demeter capped off the {{performance}} by hitting a game winning walk-off two-run {{home run in the}} bottom of the 11th inning off Al Worthington to win the game 9-7. It was the only game of his career where Don had an inside-the-park or walk-off home run. Don was the first Dodger to hit three home runs in a single game since Snider did it four years prior on June 1, 1955 at Ebbets Field. As of July 2009, only 22 players in the history of the majors since 1900 had three home runs in a single game during their rookie season. Demeter was the 1st Dodger and 9th overall to accomplish the feat, sharing the accomplishment with hall-of-famers Eddie Mathews and Mickey Cochrane. The next morning, a photographer got Demeter out of bed at 5 in the morning to take photos <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> Los Angeles newspaper.|$|E

500|$|In 1913, the First Balkan War {{ended with}} {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire by a {{coalition}} of Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian and Montenegrin forces. Greece was considerably enlarged at the expense of Turkey, but divisions between the victorious powers in the Balkan League soon became apparent: Athens and Sofia vied for possession of Thessaloniki and its region. To affirm Greek control of the main city of Macedonia, George I moved to the city soon after its liberation. Just as he did in Athens, he went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force, and while out <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot and killed by Alexandros Schinas. Olga, who said her husband's death was [...] "the will of God", arrived at Thessaloniki the next day. She and her family visited the scene of the assassination and accompanied the body of the king to Athens. He was buried in the royal cemetery at Tatoi Palace.|$|E

2500|$|French refused Haig (commanding British I Corps) {{permission}} {{to join in}} an attack by Lanrezac (28 August), who wrote [...] "c’est une felonie" [...] and later wrote of French’s “bad humour and cowardice.” The BEF also did not join in Lanrezac’s attack on the German Second Army at Guise (29 August). Joffre spent the morning at Lanrezac’s headquarters to supervise his conduct of the battle (29 August), willing to give Lanrezac a final chance but if necessary to sack him there and then. In the event he was impressed by Lanrezac’s cool demeanour and handling of the battle, before departing <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> meeting with Sir John French. Joffre later wrote that Lanrezac had shown “the greatest quickness and comprehension” in ordering the westward attack towards Saint-Quentin to be broken off, so as {{to concentrate on the}} successful attack by Franchet d’Esperey’s I Corps in the north at Guise.|$|E
2500|$|John A. Lomax {{has been}} accused of {{paternalism}} and of tailoring Lead Belly's repertoire and clothing during his brief association with Lead Belly. [...] "But," [...] writes jazz historian Ted Gioia, few would deny the instrumental role he played in the transformation of the one-time convict into a commercially successful performer of traditional African American music. The turnabout in his life was rapid and profound: Lead Belly was released from prison on August 1, 1934; his schedule for the last week of December that year included performances for the MLA gathering in Philadelphia, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> tea in Bryn Mawr, and for an informal gathering of professors from Columbia and NYU. Even {{by the standards of the}} entertainment industry ... this was a remarkable transformation. After his three-months as a performer illustrating John A. Lomax's lectures, Lead Belly went on to a 15-year career as an independent artist, championed and assisted intermittently (but not managed) by Alan Lomax.|$|E
2500|$|At 18:35 {{local time}} (14:35 GMT), 20km from the Osirak reactor complex, the F-16 {{formation}} climbed to 2,100 m {{and went into}} a 35-degree dive at 1,100km/h, aimed at the reactor complex. At 1,100 m, the F-16s began releasing the Mark 84 bombs in pairs, at 5-second intervals. At least eight of the sixteen released bombs struck the containment dome of the reactor. It was later revealed that {{half an hour before}} the Israeli planes arrived, a group of Iraqi soldiers manning anti-aircraft defenses had left their posts <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> meal, turning off their radars. The Israeli planes were still intercepted by Iraqi defenses but managed to evade the remaining anti-aircraft fire. The squadron climbed to high altitude and started their return to Israel. The attack lasted less than two minutes. According to Ze'ev Raz, the leader of the attack force, the Israeli pilots radioed each other and recited the biblical verse [...] as they were returning to the base.|$|E

In 1990 {{he became a}} {{national}} talk-show host on the ABC Radio Network, which was {{trying to build a}} group of nationwide talk shows at the time. Lynn Samuels was forced to share her local WABC show with Farber which led to on-air confrontations, and resulted in her departure from the station. [...] ABC's project later was abandoned, and Farber, Michael Castello, and Alan Colmes got together and quickly formed their own independent network called Daynet. He is now on CRN Digital Talk Radio, weekdays, and on the Talk Radio Network, hosting a one-hour weekend show and filling in for TRN's weekday hosts, most commonly on The Laura Ingraham Show. Early in the 1970s, Farber was an adjunct professor of journalism at St. John's University in New York. Often, his former students are heard calling his radio program with admiring words and memories.|$|E
