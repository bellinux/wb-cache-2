When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> called cirrostratus.

5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

The objective of this research is to compare MODIS cloud top pressures and MISR cloud top heights over the Caribbean region to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of both instruments.

MISR cloud top heights can be approximately 2 to 4 kilometers <b>higher</b> than MODIS <b>cloud</b> top heights in most of the situations when MISR cloud top heights are higher. Other variations between MODIS and MISR cloud top heights may indicate the retrieval of two different cloud heights over the same area when highest error between MISR and MODIS <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> vary between 15 and 19 kilometers. This observation may indicate that one of {{the instruments}} was detecting a low cloud.

After Namu had crossed Malaita, the FMS estimated that Namu had developed a small ring of hurricane force winds, about [...] from the centre. They also estimated that the system had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150km/h (90mph), which made it a Category3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. At around this time the JTWC also estimated that Namu had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 155km/h (100mph), which made it equivalent to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The system subsequently crossed Guadalcanal and 160°E where it moved into the Australian region during May 19, where a broad and ragged eye became visible in satellite imagery but quickly became obscured by <b>high</b> <b>cloud.</b> Namu subsequently came {{under the influence of}} high level westerly winds, which steered the system on a south-easterly track and back into the South Pacific basin.

60|$|In his {{forays into}} the North Atlantic the East Wind behaves like a subtle and cruel adventurer without {{a notion of}} honour or fair play. Veiling his clear-cut, lean face in {{a thin layer of}} a hard, <b>high</b> <b>cloud,</b> I have seen him, like a wizened robber sheik of the sea, hold up large caravans of ships to the number of three hundred or more at the very gates of the English Channel.

We gazed helplessly at the systematic, cold, gray-eyed obstinacy of the Easterly weather, while short rations became the order of the day, and the pinch of hunger under the breast-bone grew familiar to every sailor in that held-up fleet. Every day added to our numbers. In knots and groups and straggling parties we flung to and fro before the closed gate. And meantime the outward-bound ships passed, running through our humiliated ranks under all the canvas they could show. It is my idea that the Easterly Wind helps the ships away from home in the wicked hope that they shall all come to an untimely end and be heard of no more. For six weeks did the robber sheik hold the trade route of the earth, while our liege lord, the West Wind, slept profoundly like a tired Titan, or else remained lost in a mood of idle sadness known only to frank natures. All was still to the westward; we looked in vain towards his stronghold: the King slumbered on so deeply that he let his foraging brother steal the very mantle of gold-lined purple clouds from his bowed shoulders. What had become of the dazzling hoard of royal jewels exhibited at every close of day? Gone, disappeared, extinguished, carried off without leaving a single gold band or the flash of a single sunbeam in the evening sky! Day after day through a cold streak of heavens as bare and poor as the inside of a rifled safe a rayless and despoiled sun would slink shamefacedly, without pomp or show, to hide in haste under the waters. And still the King slept on, or mourned the vanity of his might and his power, while the thin-lipped intruder put the impress of his cold and implacable spirit upon the sky and sea. With every daybreak the rising sun had to wade through a crimson stream, luminous and sinister, like the spilt blood of celestial bodies murdered during the night.|$|E

30|$|These studies {{raise the}} {{question}} of why such high-cloud responses occur and why the high-cloud responses of NICAM are {{different from those of the}} other GCMs. Noda et al. (2014) partly answered the latter question by analyzing the areal size distribution and radiative effects of <b>high</b> <b>clouds.</b> Changes in cloud clusters are a main focus of the NICAM subgroup of the SOUSEI program. Because cloud distributions simulated by NICAM look similar to those observed in satellite images (Miura et al. 2007), the area coverage of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> is analyzed and compared with observations (Inoue et al. 2008). Using this method, Noda et al. (2014) compared the distribution of cloud size in the two climates and found that the number of smaller <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> is more drastically increased in the warmer climate and that the cloud radiative forcing by smaller clouds less than about 50  km in radius contributed to the positive feedback by LWCRF. Such small-scale clouds are not generally explicitly represented by ordinary GCMs and parameterized by cloud macro-physics schemes such as cloud fraction, but they are explicitly represented in NICAM. These findings suggest that assumptions introduced in the cloud macro-physics schemes should be examined more closely and compared with explicit calculations using cloud microphysics schemes to understand the different responses of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> between models. Noda et al. (2016) extended this approach to examine the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis (Hartmann and Larson 2002) as described below.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{to compare}} cloud properties simulated by global climate models with those retrieved from observations by satellite-based infrared (IR) sounders has been developed. The relatively high spectral {{resolution in the}} CO 2 absorption band of these instruments leads to especially reliable cirrus properties, day and night. Additionally, bulk microphysical properties can be retrieved for semi-transparent cirrus, based on the observed spectral emissivity differences between 8 and 11 µm. The particular intention {{of this study is}} to compare macro-and microphysical properties of high cloudiness as represented by the model simulations and the satellite data. For this purpose, a method has been developed to process the model output to be comparable to the satellite measurements, as in other observational simulator packages (for example the ISCCP-simulator). This simulator method takes into account i) the differences in horizontal resolution of the model and the observations, ii) the specific observation time windows, iii) the determination of the pressure of a cloud system, identified with the pressure at the middle of the uppermost cloud, and iv) the selection of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> with specific cloud optical thickness ranges for the microphysical property retrieval using IR sounder data. Applying this method to simulations by the global climate model ECHAM and TOVS satellite observations has important effects. The frequency of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> selected from the model output by using the method is significantly smaller than the total frequency of high cloudiness in the model. Largest differences occur around the equator where the zonal mean frequency of high cloudiness is reduced by about 30 % (relative change). The selection method is essential for the comparison of modelled and observed microphysical properties of <b>high</b> <b>clouds.</b> The selection of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> from the ECHAM simulation according to the optical thickness range of the TOVS data results in a reduction of the mean water path of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> by factors of more than 3 compared to the case where also <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> of other optical thicknesses are considered. Furthermore, the selection by optical thickness causes a significant increase in the mean effective cloud particle diameter. These changes significantly reduce the differences between the simulation and the observations. The method can also be applied for comparisons with other IR sounder climatologies such as from AIRS and IASI. © Gebruder Borntraeger, Stuttgart 2010...|$|R
