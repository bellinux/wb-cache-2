2500|$|Lugged {{steel frame}} {{construction}} is a method of building bicycle frames using steel tubing mated with socket-like sleeves, called lugs. [...] For most of the bicycle's history, steel has been the primary material for bicycle frames, with lugged construction the primary assembling method. [...] Steel continues in use by builders of high-quality steel frames, though its dominance as a <b>frame</b> <b>material</b> has waned since the mid-1990s displaced largely by aluminum and carbon fiber; lugging has been displaced by TIG welding.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout this era, {{development}} of automotive technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898, though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bollée in 1873), and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909). Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the <b>frame</b> <b>material</b> of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905. (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.) ...|$|E

5000|$|A braze-on is {{the name}} {{for any number of}} parts of a bicycle which have been {{permanently}} attached to the frame. The term [...] "braze-on" [...] comes from when these parts would have been brazed on to steel frame bicycles.

The minimum bending radius of three different copper alloys (Cu-Fe-P, Cu-Ni-Si, Cu-Cr-Sn-Zn) for lead <b>frame</b> <b>materials</b> was analyzed by using finite element. Tensile tests for the three kinds of materials were done to obtain yield stress, ultimate strength and other parameters. The strain-hardening exponent n and normal anisotropy index r of the materials were obtained according to the tensile tests. The minimum bending radius of corresponding materials was available with the simulation analysis, and consequently, the bending properties of the different materials were compared. The results show that the bending property of Cu-Cr-Sn-Zn alloy is the best, and Cu-Ni-Si alloy the worst...|$|R
