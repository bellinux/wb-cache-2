40|$|This paper proposes an {{effective}} novel cuckoo search algorithm (ENCSA) {{in order to}} enhance the operation capacity of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>power</b> systems, considering the constraints in the transmission network, and especially to overcome optimal power flow (OPF) problems. This proposed algorithm is developed {{on the basis of the}} conventional cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) by two modified techniques: the first is the self-adaptive technique for generating the second new solutions via discovery of alien eggs, and the second is the high-quality solutions based on a selection technique to keep the best solutions among all new and old solutions. These techniques are able to expand the search zone to overcome the local optimum trap and are able to improve the optimal solution quality and convergence speed as well. Therefore, the proposed method has significant impacts on the searching performances. The efficacy of the proposed method is investigated and verified using IEEE 30 and 118 buses systems via numerical simulation. The obtained results are compared with the conventional cuckoo search algorithm (CCSA) and the modified cuckoo search algorithm (MCSA). As a result, the proposed method can overcome the OPF of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>power</b> systems better than the conventional ones in terms of the optimal solution quality, convergence speed, and high success rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Short-term Generation Scheduling models (STGS) are {{concerned}} with the calculation of an optimal generation policy while taking into account various operational limits in transmission and generation systems. Most STGS models described in the literature totally ignore representation of reactive portions of the transmission system. Such purely active models tend to calculate generation policies that may lead the system to operating points presenting security problems associated with reactive aspects (such as voltage instability, etc.). A class of problems denominated <b>Hydrothermal</b> Optimal <b>Power</b> Flow (HOPF) models have been proposed to represent active/reactive STGS studies. This paper proposes a HOPF model concerned with detailed representation of active and reactive aspects of the transmission system. Lagrangian Relaxation is applied to solve the proposed HOPF model. This technique is based on relaxation of dynamic constraints together with the coordination of such constraints using Lagrange multipliers. HOPF and the proposed solution technique are applied to IEEE 30 bus test system. Solutions obtained by the HOPF model are compared with those obtained by purely active dispatch models. Results point-out the importance of the representation of reactive aspects in dispatch studies. Results also confirm robustness of the proposed solution methodology...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on the material demand and life-cycle energy and emissions performance of power-generating technologies {{in addition to those}} reported in Part I of this series. The additional technologies included concentrated solar power, integrated gasification combined cycle, and a fossil/renewable (termed hybrid) geothermal technology, more specifically, co-produced gas and electric power plants from geo-pressured gas and electric (GPGE) sites. For the latter, two cases were considered: gas and electricity export and electricity-only export. Also modeled were cement, steel and diesel fuel requirements for drilling geothermal wells as a function of well depth. The impact of the construction activities in the building of plants was also estimated. The results of this study are consistent with previously reported trends found in Part I of this series. Among all the technologies considered, fossil combustion-based power plants have the lowest material demand for their construction and composition. On the other hand, conventional fossil-based power technologies have the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, followed by the hybrid and then two of the renewable <b>power</b> systems, namely <b>hydrothermal</b> flash <b>power</b> and biomass-based combustion power. GHG emissions from U. S. geothermal flash plants were also discussed, estimates provided, and data needs identified.

5000|$|Until recently, the Pink and White Terraces {{were thought}} to be about 1,000 years old. The <b>hydrothermal</b> system which <b>powered</b> them may be up to 7,000 years old. The silica {{precipitation}} formed many pools and steps over time. Precipitation occurred by two methods. The ascending foundation over time formed a lip which would trap the descending flow and become level again. This process formed attractive swimming places, both for the shape and for the warm water. When the thermal layers sloped in the other direction away from the geyser, then silica steps formed on the surface. Both types of formation grew as silica-laden water cascaded over them, and the water also enhanced the spectacle. Geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter wrote after his visit in 1859 that [...] "doubtless thousands of years were required" [...] for their formation.|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) as a renewable resource could overcome waste disposal issues, generate power for fossil fuel displacement, and mitigate CO 2 emissions from landfill. However, the availability of waste feedstock varies with the effectiveness of waste management while the profitability and the environmental impact are mostly dependent on the conversion technology, plant location, and plant capacity. This study aims to evaluate the complexity of waste-to-energy (WTE) supply chain networks for energy production and the CO 2 mitigation potential through a spatially explicit approach. The Malaysian peninsular is selected {{as a case study}} area. This study adapted the IIASA techno-economic engineering model for optimizing renewable energy systems (BeWhere) and developed a WTE optimization component. The model minimizes the full supply chain cost of WTE, optimizes the capacity and location of WTE production plants, and assesses the energy and by-product potentials. Several scenarios were designed to analyze the impact of energy and carbon mitigation potential of WTE with varying the fossil fuel prices or carbon tax in the supply chain. The results show that incineration and <b>hydrothermal</b> for <b>power</b> production are the preferred options, primarily because of the low economic investment and the high energy conversion efficiency. Apart from the power as the main product, the system produces biofuel as by-product. It is found that most of the plants are installed in more highly populated cities with large potential for waste biomass, hence reducing logistical costs and emissions from transportation.

40|$|Endeavour crater, a Noachian-aged, 22 km {{diameter}} impact {{structure on}} Meridiani Planum, Mars, {{has been investigated}} by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunuity for over 2000 sols (Mars days). The rocks of the western rim region (oldest to youngest) are: (i) the pre-impact Matijevic fm.; (ii) rim-forming Shoemaker fm. polymict impact breccias; (iii) Grasberg fm., fine-grained sediments draping the lower slopes; and (iv) Burns fm., sulfate-rich sandstones that onlap the Grasberg fm. The rim is segmented and transected by radial fracture zones. Evidence for fluid-mediated alteration includes m-scale detections of phyllosilicates from orbit, and cm-scale variations in rock/soil composition/mineralogy documented by the Opportunity instrument suite. The m-scale phyllosilicate detections include Fe(3 +) -Mg and aluminous smectites that occur in patches in the Matijevic and Shoemaker fms. Rock compositions do not reveal substantial differences for smectite-bearing compared to smectite-free rocks. Interpretation: large-scale <b>hydrothermal</b> alteration <b>powered</b> by impact-deposited heat acting on limited water supplies engendered mineralogic transfomations under low water/rock, near-isochemical conditions. The cm-scale alterations, localized in fracture zones, occurred at higher water/rock as evidenced by enhanced Si and Al contents through leaching of more soluble elements, and deposition of Mg, Ni and Mn sulphates and halogen salts in soils. Visible/near infrared reflectance of narrow curvilinear red zones indicate higher nanophase ferric oxide contents and possibly hydration compared to surrounding outcrops. Broad fracture zones on the rim have reflectance features consistent with development of ferric oxide minerals. Interpretation: water fluxing through the fractures in a hydrothermal system resulting from the impact engendered alteration and leaching under high water/rock conditions. Late, localized alteration is documented by Ca-sulfate-rich veins that are not confined to fracture zones; some cross-cut the Grasberg fm. Interpretation: late fluid mobilization of soluble elements, likely in a later alteration event...|$|R
