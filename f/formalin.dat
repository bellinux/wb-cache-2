5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with <b>formalin.</b> The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The second inactivated polio {{virus vaccine}} was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine, is based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with <b>formalin.</b> After two doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99 percent are immune to poliovirus following three doses.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and <b>formalin,</b> a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formalin</b> use {{in foods}} {{is a crucial}} problem in Bangladesh currently. Local stores and {{supermarkets}} often sell fruits, fishes, and vegetables that have been treated with <b>formalin</b> to keep them fresh. However, in 2015, a <b>Formalin</b> Control Bill was passed in the Parliament of Bangladesh with a provision of life-term imprisonment as the maximum punishment and in addition 2,000,000 BDT as fine {{but not less than}} 500,000 BDT for importing, production or hoarding of <b>formalin</b> without license.|$|E

25|$|The {{collagen}} fibers {{are approximately}} 1-2 μm thick. Thus, {{the resolution of}} the imaging technique needs to be approximately 0.5 μm. Some techniques allow the direct acquisition of volume data while other need the slicing of the specimen. In both cases, the volume that is extracted must be able to follow the fiber bundles across the volume. High contrast makes segmentation easier, especially when color information is available. In addition, the need for fixation must also be addressed. It has been shown that soft tissue fixation in <b>formalin</b> causes shrinkage, altering the structure of the original tissue. Some typical values of contraction for different fixation are: <b>formalin</b> (5% - 10%), alcohol (10%), bouin (<5%).|$|E
25|$|Both {{feet and}} the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also {{preserved}} in <b>formalin</b> for later examination. In 1976, the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis, making Tollund Man's thumbprint {{one of the oldest}} prints on record.|$|E
25|$|However, the mite-infested beetles {{were not}} {{destroyed}} and were instead used to breed new generations of beetles under sterile conditions. Dung beetle eggs were dipped in 3% <b>formalin</b> for 3 minutes to sterilise them, then packed into hand-rolled dung balls for incubation. These eggs successfully developed into adult beetles and {{were among those}} in the first batches released into the wild on 30 January 1968 in Lansdown, near Townsville, Queensland. This quarantine method was subsequently adopted at the CSIRO research base in Pretoria, South Africa, with the added step of the eggs being transported by air in sealed containers of sterilised peat moss.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{modifications}} of Moniz's operation were introduced with little delay by Italian medical practitioners. Most notably, in 1937 Amarro Fiamberti, the {{medical director of}} a psychiatric institution in Varese, first devised the transorbital procedure whereby the frontal lobes were accessed through the eye sockets. Fiamberti's method was to puncture the thin layer of orbital bone {{at the top of}} the socket and then inject alcohol or <b>formalin</b> into the white matter of the frontal lobes through this aperture. Using this method, while sometimes substituting a leucotome for a hypodermic needle, it is estimated that he leucotomised about 100 patients in the period up to the outbreak of World War II. Fiamberti's innovation of Moniz's method would later prove inspirational for Walter Freeman's development of transorbital lobotomy.|$|E

Inactive polio vaccine [...] is prepared by <b>formalin</b> inactivation of three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney or Brunenders (PV1), MEF-1/Lansing (PV2), and Saukett/Leon (PV3). Oral polio vaccine [...] contains live attenuated (weakened) strains of the three serotypes of poliovirus. Passaging the virus strains in monkey kidney epithelial cells introduces mutations in the viral IRES, and hinders (or attenuates) {{the ability of the}} virus to infect nervous tissue.|$|E

2500|$|Einstein's autopsy was {{conducted}} in a lab at Princeton Hospital by pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey shortly after Einstein's death [...] in 1955. Harvey removed and weighed the brain at 1230g. Harvey then took the brain to a lab at the University of Pennsylvania where he dissected it into several pieces; some of the pieces he kept to himself while others were given to leading pathologists. He claimed he hoped that cytoarchitectonics would reveal useful information. Harvey injected 50% <b>formalin</b> through the internal carotid arteries and afterward suspended the intact brain in 10% <b>formalin.</b> Harvey photographed the brain from many angles. He then dissected it into about 240 blocks (each about 1cm3) and encased the segments in a plastic-like material called collodion. Harvey also removed Einstein's eyes, and gave them to Henry Abrams, Einstein's ophthalmologist.|$|E
2500|$|The first vaccine against canine {{distemper}} {{was developed by}} an Italian named Puntoni. In 1923 and 1924, Putoni published two artices in which he added <b>formalin</b> to brain tissue from infected dogs to create a vaccine which successfully prevented the disease in healthy dogs. A commercial vaccine was developed in 1950, yet owing to limited use, the virus remains prevalent in many populations.|$|E

[...] "I {{made another}} {{excursion}} to the invertebrate and brought away specimens {{for you and}} for Professor Verrill of Yale. [...] I cut two (2) pieces of the Mantle and two (2) pieces from the body and have put them into a solution of <b>Formalin</b> for a few days before I send them to you although, strange as it may seem to you, I could have packed them in salt and send them to you at once. (?) [...] The creature has been drying on the shore for two months. [...] (Requests permission to pack in salt instead of <b>formalin.)</b> [...] Mentions viscera.

2500|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, formaldehyde also forms a hydrate, methanediol, with the formula [...] This compound also exists in equilibrium with various oligomers (short polymers), {{depending on the}} concentration and temperature. A saturated water solution, of about 40% formaldehyde by volume or 37% by mass, is called [...] "100% formalin". A small amount of stabilizer, such as methanol, is usually added to suppress oxidation and polymerization. A typical commercial grade <b>formalin</b> may contain 10–12% methanol in addition to various metallic impurities. The name was long ago genericized from an old trade name [...] "Formalin".|$|E
2500|$|Ichthyologists Pietsch, Arnold, and Hall {{collected}} a holotype from the Laha I dive site at Maluku Divers on April 2, 2008. [...] They {{discovered that the}} fish, when fixed in <b>formalin</b> and preserved in ethanol, shrank 23% (especially the fleshy cheeks and chin) within four months and hardened considerably. [...] The colors all faded to a solid white, but when viewed using a dissecting microscope, the stripes were again visible. [...] These observations {{were consistent with the}} mysterious paisley anglers from Bali in 1992. [...] This was subsequently tested on the two specimens saved from 1992, and the stripes could still be found using this method.|$|E
2500|$|About 40% of all acute viral {{hepatitis}} {{is caused by}} HAV. [...] Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection. [...] The virus is resistant to detergent, acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., ether, chloroform), drying, and temperatures up to 60°C. [...] It can survive for months in fresh and salt water. [...] Common-source (e.g., water, restaurant) outbreaks are typical. [...] Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% incidence, but following infection, lifelong immunity results. [...] HAV can be inactivated by chlorine treatment (drinking water), <b>formalin</b> (0.35%, 37°C, 72 hours), peracetic acid (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1 hour), and UV radiation (2 μW/cm2/min).|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, {{is also an important}} factor regulating animal growth. [...] Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also Environmental impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with <b>formalin</b> to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{principle}} in the dissection of human cadavers is {{the prevention of}} human disease to the dissector. Prevention of transmission includes the wearing of protective gear, ensuring the environment is clean, dissection technique and predissection tests to specimens {{for the presence of}} HIV and Hepatitis viruses. Specimens are dissected in morgues or anatomy labs. When provided, they are evaluated for use as a [...] "fresh" [...] or [...] "prepared" [...] specimen. A [...] "fresh" [...] specimen may be dissected within some days, retaining the characteristics of a living specimen, for the purposes of training. A [...] "prepared" [...] specimen may be preserved in solutions such as <b>formalin</b> and pre-dissected by an experienced anatomist, sometimes {{with the help of a}} diener. This preparation is sometimes called prosection.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1992, a {{shipment}} of assorted fishes from Bali, Indonesia, to the Dallas Aquarium at Fair Park revealed [...] "something different"— two curious-looking anglerfish that {{became known as the}} [...] "paisley anglers". [...] They were in [...] "very poor condition", and they died that same month. [...] The specimens were preserved and sent to Pietsch for identification, along with a photo, although the photo was poor quality. [...] However, after having been fixed in <b>formalin</b> and preserved in ethanol, their colors faded to a solid white, and their frilled faces lost their distinct frill shape. [...] When the fish were analyzed, they were misidentified as cryptic anglerfish (Histiophryne cryptacanthus). [...] These specimens were preserved and placed on a shelf.

2500|$|Histopathology {{refers to}} the {{microscopic}} examination of various forms of human tissue. [...] Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology {{refers to the}} examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. [...] This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. [...] Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. [...] The tissue {{is removed from the}} body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is <b>formalin,</b> although frozen section fixing is also common. [...] To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. [...] Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. [...] The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. [...] In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.|$|E
2500|$|Male Chasmagnathus granulatus crabs {{exhibit a}} [...] "defensive response" [...] to {{electric}} shocks. [...] During {{a study on}} the ability of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) learning to avoid an electrical shock, it was observed that many crabs emerged from the dark shelter to avoid the shock thus entering a brightly light area which would normally be avoided. [...] Immediately after the injection of <b>formalin</b> (an irritant in mammals) or saline into one cheliped (the leg which ends with the claw), shore crabs move quickly into the corner of the aquarium and [...] "freeze" [...] after 2 to 3 seconds. [...] After 1 to 3 minutes, these injected animals are fidgety and exhibit a wide range of movements such as flexion, extension, shaking or rubbing the affected claw. Formalin-treated animals show 20-times more rubbing behaviour during the first minute after injection than saline-treated crabs. Intense rubbing of the claw results in autotomy (shedding) in 20% of animals of the formalin-treated group whereas saline-injected crabs do not autotomise the injected cheliped. [...] During the 10 minutes after injection, crabs in the formalin-treated group tried to use the intact cheliped, guarding the damaged cheliped. [...] The scientists conducting this study commented [...] "the present results obtained in crabs may be indicative of pain experience rather than relating to a simple nociceptive reflex". Other species of crab have been shown to autotomise legs when placed on a hot plate or exposed to a small electric shock.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} frenzy of microbe killing, {{surgical}} instruments were dipped in carbolic oil, {{which was a}} great improvement on not dipping them in anything at all and simply using them dirty; but as microbes are so fond of carbolic oil that they swarm in it, {{it was not a}} success from the anti-microbe point of view. <b>Formalin</b> was squirted into the circulation of consumptives until it was discovered that <b>formalin</b> nourishes the tubercle bacillus handsomely and kills men. The popular theory of disease is the common medical theory: namely, that every disease had its microbe duly created in the garden of Eden, and has been steadily propagating itself and producing widening circles of malignant disease ever since. It was plain from the first that if this had been even approximately true, the whole human race would have been wiped out by the plague long ago, and that every epidemic, instead of fading out as mysteriously as it rushed in, would spread over the whole world. It was also evident that the characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead of a cause. An unpunctual man is always in a hurry; but it does not follow that hurry is the cause of unpunctuality: on the contrary, what is the matter with the patient is sloth. When Florence Nightingale said bluntly that if you overcrowded your soldiers in dirty quarters there would be an outbreak of smallpox among them, she was snubbed as an ignorant female who did not know that smallpox can be produced only by the importation of its specific microbe.|$|E

50|$|The <b>formalin</b> assay is {{the most}} popular {{chemical}} assay of nociception. It entails the injection of a dilute solution of <b>formalin</b> into the surface of the rodent's hindpaw, followed by the scoring of stereotypical behaviors such as flinching, licking, and biting of the affected hindpaw. The behaviors last for approximately 1 hour, with the early or acute stage (directly after injection) reflecting direct activation of nociceptors and the late or tonic phase (15 to 20 minutes after the injection) reflecting inflammation. Typically, the <b>formalin</b> assay is used on rats; however, <b>formalin</b> concentrations and scoring methods can be modified as to suit mice. One major advantage of the <b>formalin</b> assay over other models of inflammatory pain is the limited duration (approximately 1 hour) of the response. Additionally, as described before, this assay produces a response in two discrete stages, allowing researchers to model both acute and tonic pain using a single noxious chemical.|$|E
