40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{a practical solution}} of e-learning laboratory devoted {{to the study of}} computer networks. This laboratory has been proven with two groups of students from the University of Huelva (Spain) during two academic years. In order to achieve this objective, it has been necessary to create an entire network infrastructure that includes both the telematic access to the laboratory equipment and the remote power control. The interest of this work lies in an economical and simple system of remote control and telematic access with a twofold objective. On the one hand, to develop distance practices with attendance appearance by means of real hardware systems, not simulated. On the other hand, to reduce the power consumption regarding other proposals of remote labs with permanent power connection, providing herein an on <b>demand</b> <b>connection</b> only when required. As a result, a versatile and flexible laboratory has been put into practice whose basic network topology allows transferring traditional practices to telematic practices in a natural way and without harsh change...|$|E

40|$|When {{reliability}} is a {{major concern}} in optical WDM networks, Shared Path Protection (SPP) schemes offer the potentially appealing feature of requiring fewer network resources than their counterpart Dedicated Path Protection (DPP) schemes. However, while sharing increases resource utilization, it reduces end-to-end reliability of <b>connection</b> <b>demands.</b> Moreover, the evaluation of <b>connection</b> <b>demand</b> reliability is easy with DPP: it depends only on the components used to route the <b>connection</b> <b>demand.</b> It is more complex with SPP, as sharing of protection resources introduces dependencies among different <b>connection</b> <b>demands,</b> and the reliability of a connection depends on the failure of components that are not used to route the <b>connection</b> <b>demand</b> as well. The possible occurrence of multiple failures exacerbates this problem significantly. For this reason, the simpler DPP schemes are often chosen, even though, as a result, network resources are not efficiently used...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} the allocation of costs in connection networks. Agents have <b>connection</b> <b>demands</b> in form of pairs of locations {{they want to have}} connected. Connections between locations are costly to build. The problem is to allocate costs of networks satisfying all <b>connection</b> <b>demands.</b> We use a few axioms to characterize allocation rules that truthfully implement cost minimizing networks satisfying all <b>connection</b> <b>demands</b> in a game where: (1) a central planner announces an allocation rule and a cost estimation rule; (2) every agent reports her own <b>connection</b> <b>demand</b> as well as all connection costs; (3) the central planner selects a cost minimizing network satisfying reported <b>connection</b> <b>demands</b> based on the estimated costs; and, (4) the planner allocates the true costs of the selected network. It turns out that an allocation rule satisfies the axioms if and only if relative cost shares are fixed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} analytical method {{to assess the}} ductility <b>demand</b> on <b>connections</b> according to fire resistance requirements is developed {{on the basis of}} fundamental structural mechanics principles. An objective is to enable the development of a viable method to allow engineers to take the ductility of connections into account in design practice. Numerical finite element simulations of the single beam model were also performed to validate the simplified analytical model and reveal the important parameters that can influence the ductility <b>demand</b> within the <b>connections.</b> Using both analytical and numerical methods, the principal factors which influence the ductility <b>demand</b> of a <b>connection,</b> such as the span of the connected beam and the required connection strength, are also assessed. It is shown that: 1. The compressive ductility of connections is helpful in reducing the push-out of perimeter columns and the possibility of local buckling of beams. 2. Provision of high tensile deformation capacity allows large deflection in the beam, substantially reduces catenary forces on the connections, and consequently reduces the risk of structural collapse in fire. 3. The ductility <b>demand</b> of the <b>connection</b> is closely related to its stiffness and strength, {{as well as to the}} slenderness and load ratio of the connected beam...|$|R

Scheduled lightpath <b>demands</b> are <b>connection</b> <b>demands</b> {{for which the}} setup and teardown times are known in advance. We formulate separately the routing problem and the wavelength assignment problem as spatio-temporal combinatorial optimization problems. For the former, we propose a branch and bound algorithm for exact resolution and an alternative tabu search algorithm for approximate resolution. A generalized graph coloring approach is used to solve the wavelength assignment problem. We compared the proposed algorithms to an RWA algorithm that sequentially computes the route and wavelength assignment for the scheduled lightpath demands...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to connecting St. Louis with the west, the railroads began to <b>demand</b> <b>connections</b> with the east across the Mississippi. From 1820 to 1865 a single ferry company in Illinois controlled {{the majority of}} traffic across the river, leading to high costs and delays during winter. Plans for a bridge over the river had begun as early as 1839, but were abandoned due to cost. After the Civil War bridges across the Mississippi were completed at Quincy, Illinois and Dubuque, Iowa, linking Chicago to western markets {{at the expense of}} St. Louis. State legislators from northern Illinois conspired during the late 1860s to prevent or delay bridge construction originating in East St. Louis, Illinois, in order to cement the position of Chicago as a transit hub. However, in 1867 leading St. Louis bankers and merchants formed a company to bridge the river from the Missouri side.|$|R

40|$|The telecom {{infrastructure}} {{is undergoing a}} huge transformation since operators are deploying their own cloud infrastructure to provide cloud services and enabling Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). The resulting {{infrastructure is}} referred to as the telecom cloud. NFV decouples network functions from proprietary hardware appliances, so they can be implemented in software and deployed on virtual machines (VM) running on commercial off-the-shelf computing hardware. One of the network functions currently being considered by many operators is Content Delivery Network (CDN) for live-TV and Video on Demand (VoD) distribution. In fact, a significant advance in video delivery is the standardized MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH) technique that enables media content delivering over the Internet using standard HTTP web server infrastructure. Besides, the CDN reconfiguration, motivated by an increase in the number of users demanding content, entails a Virtual Network Topology (VNT) reconfiguration to cope with the <b>demanded</b> <b>connection</b> capacities. A Big Data-based CDN manager, fulfilling the ETSI NFV guidelines, is proposed to adapt the virtualized CDN function to current and future demand.

40|$|Many are {{interested}} in Research and Development (R&D) {{at the intersection of}} people, technology and work. R&D is a world divided and hobbled. Innovation is tantalizing yet elusive. In a rush, we achieve only a cumbersome process of trial and error (publicizing the extent of design errors and failures would be bad for investment). The standard metaphor and organizational con-struct of the pipeline has failed given the possibilities for change and the predilection for new technology to <b>demand</b> <b>connections</b> across disciplinary boundaries. R&D in this area is a world too often without effective intercon-nections and cross-stimulation. This piece provides an alternative model at two levels. First, it presents complementarity as a strategy for practice-centered research and design. The strategy is foundational for the intent behind the label cognitive systems engineering (and related labels like distributed cognition, nat-uralistic decision making, and on and on) as an alternative to traditional disci-plinary approaches. Second, it replaces the shopworn cliché of an R&D pipeline (a metaphor that may never have had substance) with synchronization of multiple parallel cycles of learning and development that operate at differ-ent time scales. Interlocking these cycles is a difficult challenge—a challenge in producing an organizational framework and supporting mechanisms to create and extend distributed innovation...|$|R

40|$|The {{ductility}} of buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs) can {{be limited}} by poor performance of the beam-column-gusset regions. Additionally, the concentric brace configuration in BRBFs can limit the use of architectural features. BRBFs with braces in eccentric configurations (called BRBF-Es) may accommodate architectural features similar to eccentrically braced frames, and limit damage to the connection regions through 1) the use of beam splices and 2) separation of the column-to-gusset connection which prevents pinching of the brace gusset plate. In this study, the system-level and component-level dynamic performances of conventional BRBF systems are {{compared with those of}} BRBF-E systems. Multi-directional dynamic analyses are performed on 5 -story BRBF and BRBF-E systems to compare drift <b>demands</b> and local <b>connection</b> <b>demands.</b> Results indicate similar stiffness between the BRBF and BRBF-E systems; however, with the BRBF-E, gusset connection stresses are reduced due to the beam splices and eccentricity between the brace connection and column...|$|R
