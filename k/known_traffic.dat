2500|$|For nearly 60 years, {{the only}} known chaser deaths were driving-related. The first was Christopher Phillips, a University of Oklahoma {{undergraduate}} student, killed in a hydroplaning accident when swerving to miss a rabbit in 1984. Three other incidents occurred when [...] was driving home from a hurricane chase in 2005, when Fabian Guerra swerved to miss a deer while driving to a chase in 2009, and when a wrong-way driver resulted in a head-on collision that killed Andy Gabrielson returning from a chase in 2012. On 31 May 2013, an extreme event led to the first known chaser deaths inflicted directly by weather when the widest tornado ever recorded struck near El Reno, Oklahoma. Engineer Tim Samaras, his photographer son Paul, and meteorologist Carl Young were killed doing in situ probe and infrasonic field research by an exceptional combination of events in which an already large and rain-obscured tornado swelled within {{less than a minute}} to [...] wide simultaneously as it changed direction and accelerated. Several other chasers were also struck and some injured by this tornado and its parent supercell's rear flank downdraft. Three chasers were killed, two in one vehicle and one in another, when their vehicles collided in West Texas in 2017, bringing the total number of <b>known</b> <b>traffic</b> related fatalities to 7. There are other incidents in which chasers were injured by automobile accidents, lightning strikes, and tornado impacts. While chasing a tornado outbreak on 13 March 1990, KWTV television photographer Bill Merickel was shot and injured near Lindsay, Oklahoma.|$|E

40|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>traffic</b> {{characteristics}} in packet networks {{is important for}} designing algorithms for managing and controlling packet networks. We demonstrate that for realistic traffic traces knowing few elementary traffic characteristics can substantially improve network utilization. Nevertheless, this improvement is often modest {{in comparison with the}} improvement that could be achieved if traffic characterization on more than one time scale were available. I. INTRODUCTION Packet networks are used to transmit traffic generated by applications that often generate complex, bursty, traffic streams. These streams may carry data, voice, image, or video information. Characterizing such traffic streams requires knowing the statistical properties of packet arrivals in time intervals of various durations called time scales. <b>Knowing</b> <b>traffic</b> on a time scale s means knowing the marginal distribution of the arrivals in a time interval of length s.

5000|$|The {{technology}} {{is dependent on}} the user's cell phone service, and uses the data download plan associated with the users account. Once connected, one of the services available is route calculations towards a specific destination. The navigation technology interface connects to the server automatically at the Internavi Information Center, calculations and route planning is then determined towards establishing the quickest route towards the selected destination. The identified route also takes into consideration all currently <b>known</b> <b>traffic</b> and local transportation issues that may affect the plotted course from the VICS center, which is updated every five minutes based on reports from various sources. As travel begins towards the destination, any updated conditions are instantly relayed to the vehicle in real time. If cellphone service connection is lost, information will be updated as the connection is reestablished. Under normal navigation conditions, FM-multiplex broadcast VICS will prompt when specific conditions become aware, such as traffic congestion. The plotted course is then modified based on new information received to adjust travel time information, to include inter-city motorway links. Information received to vehicles installed with Internavi technology are installed with an antenna externally installed. Information is also transmitted by transmitter towers located throughout Japan, identified with a [...] "Beacon Light" [...] located on main urban roads. In this manner vehicles with Internavi receive information from both the [...] "beacon light" [...] towers and by individual cellphones paired up' with vehicles, providing highly accurate information in real time.|$|E
