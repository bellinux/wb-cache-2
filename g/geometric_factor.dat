Similar to the approach used by Comunian et al. (2014), <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> and avulsion {{are assumed to be}} independent to simplify the analysis. A higher avulsion periodicity does not necessarily lead to a higher NGR and thus a higher cumulative production.|$|R

This paper reveals the contributing <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> through analyzing the crash data from Changjin Freeway, a typical mountainous freeway located in Jiangxi Province, China.

This perturbation is known to admit a multipole expansion whose coefficients are linear combinations of generalized polarization tensors. We define new <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> of a simple planar domain {{in terms of a}} conformal mapping associated with the domain. The <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> share properties of the generalized polarization tensors and are the Fourier series coefficients of a kind of generalized external angle of the inclusion boundary. Since the generalized external angle contains the Dirac delta singularity at corner points, we can determine the criterion for the existence of corner points on the inclusion boundary in terms of the <b>geometric</b> <b>factors.</b> We illustrate and validate our results with numerical examples computed to a high degree of precision using integral equation techniques, Nyström discretization, and recursively compressed inverse preconditioning.

These factors include the orientation, plane shape, floor area, plane shape factor (the ratio of the plane length to the plane width, only as regards to a rectangle-shaped plane), floor height, floor number and window-to-wall ratio. The simulation is performed in DesignBuilder, which integrates artificial lighting with instantaneous daylight during the energy simulation process. The <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> of the defined prototype are examined in both single-parameter and multi-parameter evaluations. As to the multi-parameter results, the energy saving rate can vary by up to 18. 9 %, and reducing the floor height is observed to be the most effective means of reducing annual total end-use energy consumption, followed by increasing the plane shape factor and reducing the floor area.

50|$|The SST {{detectors}} {{consist of}} three arrays of double-ended telescopes, {{each of which}} is composed of either a pair or triplet of closely sandwiched semi-conductor detectors. The center detector (Thick or T) of the triplet is 1.5 cm2 in area, 500 μm thick, while the other detectors, foil (F) and open (O), are the same area but only 300 μm thick. One direction of the telescopes is covered in a thin lexan foil, ~1500 Å of aluminum evaporated on each side to completely eliminate sunlight, (SST-Foil) where the thickness was chosen to stop protons up to the energy of electrons (~400 keV). Electrons are essentially unaffected by the foil. On the opposite side (SST-Open), a common broom magnet is used to refuse electrons below ~400 keV from entering but leaves the ions essentially unaffected. Thus, if no higher energy particles penetrate the detector walls, the SST-Foil should only measure electrons and the SST-Open only ions. Each double-ended telescope has two 36° x 20° FWHM FOV, thus each end of the five telescopes can cover a 180° x 20° piece of space. Telescope 6 views the same angle to spin axis as telescope 2, but both ends of telescope 2 have a drilled tantalum cover to reduce the <b>geometric</b> <b>factor</b> by a factor of 10 to measure the most intense fluxes. The SST-Foil data structures typically have 7 energy bins each with 48 data points while the SST-Open has 9 energy bins each with 48 data points. Both detectors have energy resolutions of ΔE/E ≈ 30%.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> on the galvanic current density distribution for AZ 91 D coupled to steel was investigated using experimental measurements and a BEM model. The <b>geometric</b> <b>factors</b> were area ratio of anode/cathode, insulation distance between anode and cathode, depth of solution film covering the galvanic couple {{and the manner}} of interaction caused by two independent interacting galvanic couples. The galvanic current density distribution calculated from the BEM model was in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The galvanic current density distribution caused by the interaction of two independent galvanic couples can be reasonably predicted as the linear addition of the galvanic current density caused by each individual galvanic couple.

Size control is crucial in obtaining a high-quality mesh with a reduced number of elements, which decreases computational time and memory use during mesh generation and analysis.

40|$|After Yogyakarta {{earthquake}} in 2006, {{the main problem}} {{that occurred in the}} first yard of Prambanan Temple is ponding area that occurred after rainfall. Soil characterization needs to be determined by conducting several processes, especially permeability coefficient (k) in both saturated and unsaturated conditions to solve this problem. More accurate and efficient field testing procedure is required to obtain permeability data that present the field condition. One of the field permeability test equipment is Constant Discharge procedure to determine the permeability coefficient. Necessary adjustments of the Constant Discharge procedure are needed to be determined especially the value of <b>geometric</b> <b>factor</b> (F) to improve the corresponding value of permeability coefficient. The value of k will be correlated with the value of volumetric water content (θ) of an unsaturated condition until saturated condition. The principle procedure of Constant Discharge model provides a constant flow in permeameter tube that flows into the ground until the water level in the tube becomes constant. Constant water level in the tube is highly dependent on the tube dimension. Every tube dimension has a shape factor called the <b>geometric</b> <b>factor</b> that affects the result of the test. <b>Geometric</b> <b>factor</b> value is defined as the characteristic of shape and radius of the tube. This research has modified the <b>geometric</b> <b>factor</b> parameters by using empty material tube method so that the <b>geometric</b> <b>factor</b> will change. Saturation level is monitored by using soil moisture sensor. The field test results were compared with the results of laboratory tests to validate the results of the test.
