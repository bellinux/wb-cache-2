40|$|Amyloidosis {{constitutes}} a heterogeneous group of diseases {{characterized by the}} deposition of proteinaceous material composed mainly of fibrils having a fl-pleated sheet configuration (1). The nature {{of some of these}} deposits has been clarified in recent years, and {{it has been shown that}} under appropriate conditions a number of proteins can form fibrils that exhibit the histologic and physicochemical properties of amyloid. In the form associated with plasma cell proliferation, the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>protein</b> is an intact immunoglobulin light chain and/or its amino terminal variable-region fragment (2), whereas the deposits in the acquired "secondary amyloidosis " and in familial Mediterranean fever consist of the AA protein, which is a degradation product of an acute phase reactant, serum AA protein (3, 4). The nature of the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>protein</b> in certain heredofamilial forms of amyloidosis that demonstrate autosomal-dominant inheritance is only now being defined.

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous {{proteins}} can {{be converted}} to amyloid-like fibrils to increase cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis, but the methods generally require a high concentration of protein, vigorous shaking, or fibril seed. As well, the detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic effects is not well characterized. In this study, we have developed a novel process to convert native proteins into the fibrillar form. We used globular bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein to verify the properties of the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>protein,</b> investigated its cellular effects and studied the signaling cascade induced by the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>protein.</b> Results We induced BSA, a non-cytotoxic globular protein, to become fibril by a novel process involving Superdex- 200 column chromatography in the presence of anionic or zwittergenic detergent(s). The column pore size was more important than column matrix composite in fibril formation. The fibrillar BSA induced apoptosis in BHK- 21 cell as well as breast cancer cell line T 47 D. Pre-treating cells with anti-integrin antibodies blocked the apoptotic effect. Fibrillar BSA, but not globular BSA, bound to integrin, dephosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Akt and glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β). Conclusion We report on a novel process for converting globular proteins into fibrillar form to cause apoptosis by modulating the integrin/FAK/Akt/GSK- 3 β/caspase- 3 signaling pathway. Our findings may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of amyloid-like fibrils and applicable for the development of better therapeutic agents that target the underlying mechanism(s) of the etiologic agents. </p...|$|E

Whey protein foaming capacity and stability were related to protein concentration, pH, time of whipping, pressure and heating treatments.

Dynamic high shear (microfluidization) or moderate shear (Ultra-Turrax mixing) of <b>fibrillar</b> <b>protein</b> dispersions did not significantly affect their subsequent foaming properties. Furthermore, foams prepared with fibrillar whey protein (0 % protein) had comparable capacity and stability to that from egg white protein, which is the traditional foaming ingredient in food industry.

40|$|Small heat-shock {{proteins}} (sHsps) are {{a diverse}} family of intra-cellular molecular chaperone proteins that {{play a critical}} role in mitigating and preventing protein aggregation under stress conditions such as elevated temperature, oxidation and infection.

30|$|Amyloidosis {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} group of metabolic disorders characterised by extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins consisting of beta-pleated sheets. Clinically, amyloidosis can be classified as either systemic or localised [27]. Systemic forms of amyloidosis include primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis and familial amyloidosis. Primary amyloidosis occurs in the absence of pre-existing disease, with the exception of dyscrasias (e.g. multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia). Secondary amyloidosis, which is the more common form, results from a number of conditions, such as chronic renal failure, chronic infection and neoplasia. Localised forms are characterised by local production of <b>fibrillar</b> <b>proteins</b> (usually amyloid light chain [AL] type), which can be deposited in nearly any organ. Familial amyloidosis typically presents as sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in the second or third decade of life [28]. The kidneys and heart can also be involved.
