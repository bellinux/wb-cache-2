It is essential to remove endotoxins from parenteral preparations since they have multiple injurious biological activities. Because of their strong heat resistance (e. g., requiring dry-heat sterilization at 250 °C for 30 min) {{and the formation of}} various supramolecular aggregates, depyrogenation is more difficult than sterilization. We report here that soft <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing,</b> which has many advantages in safety and cost efficiency, is sufficient to assure complete depyrogenation by the inactivation of endotoxins. The endotoxin concentration in a sample was measured by using a chromogenic limulus method with an endotoxin-specific limulus reagent. The endotoxin concentration was calculated from a standard curve obtained using a serial dilution of a standard solution. We show that endotoxins were completely inactivated by soft <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> at 130 °C for 60 min or at 140 °C for 30 min {{in the presence of a}} high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} research, {{this paper presents}} the basic characteristics of chemical substances formed {{as a result of}} <b>hydrothermal</b> wood <b>processing.</b> Wood that had been exposed to a mild thermal treatment was extracted with organic solvents to determine the presence of potentially toxic compounds. The formation of some toxic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons derivatives of phenantrene were detected as well as other classes of polyaromatic compounds. It is most likely that the presence of all such compounds contributes to a relatively substantial extent to the reported resistance of heat treated timber to fungal and other biological attack. Other allegedly non-toxic compounds were also found, mainly the by-products of lignin pyrolysis. The extent of toxic and non-toxic compounds in heat treated wood were not quantified, and therefore it is not determined whether the final product (thermal treated wood) is toxic or not, and to what extent. The two major volatile organic compounds found while researching atmospheric emissions from an industrial kiln, drying radiata pine, were alpha – pinene and beta – pinene, which accounted for up to 90 % of the total discharge (405 g/m 3 wood). Most of the volatile organic compounds were released during early stages of drying. The release of potentially hazardous components (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, furfural) was found to be relatively low (1. 1, 8. 7, and 0. 1 g/m 3 wood) and well dispersed all over the kiln. These levels of release are unlikely to cause adverse environmental effects. Volatile organic components were also researched on radiata pine wood dried in an experimental vacuum kiln. The condensate (volitilased components with water vapour) was sampled at regular time intervals throughout a 114 h drying period. Chemical analysis data from a green wood sample indicated that 10 % of monoterpenes present were recovered in the kiln condensate. The main classes of organic compounds identified in the condensate were alcohol monoterpenes (endoborneol, alpha – terpineol, and 1, 4 -terpineol), methanol, acetic acid, formaldehyde, furfural, and diterpenes.

40|$|International audienceAqueous Co(II) {{chloride}} complexes play {{a crucial}} role in cobalt transport and deposition in ore-forming <b>hydrothermal</b> systems, ore <b>processing</b> plants, and in the corrosion of special Co-bearing alloys. Reactive transport modelling of cobalt in hydrothermal fluids relies on the availability of thermodynamic properties for Co complexes over a wide range of temperature, pressure and salinity. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the speciation of cobalt(II) in 0 - 6 m chloride solutions at temperatures between 35 and 440 degrees C at a constant pressure of 600 bar. Qualitative analysis of XANES spectra shows that octahedral species predominate in solution at 35 degrees C, while tetrahedral species become increasingly important with increasing temperature. Ab MUM XANES calculations and EXAFS analyses suggest that in high temperature solutions the main species at high salinity (Cl:Co >> 2) is CoCl 42 - while a lower order tetrahedral complex, most likely CoCl 2 (H 2 O) (2 (aq)), predominates at low salinity (Cl:Co ratios similar to 2). EXAFS analyses further revealed the bonding distances for the octahedral Co(H 2 O) (6) (2 +) (Co-oct-O = 2. 075 (19) angstrom), tetrahedral CoCl 42 - (Co-tet-Cl = 2. 252 (19) angstrom) and tetrahedral CoCl 2 (H 2 O) (2 (aq)) (Co-tet-O = 2. 038 (54) angstrom and Co-tet-Cl = 2. 210 (56) angstrom). An analysis of the Co(II) speciation in sodium bromide solutions shows a similar trend, with tetrahedral bromide complexes becoming predominant at higher temperature/salinity than in the chloride system. EXAFS analysis confirms that the limiting complex at high bromide concentration at high temperature is CoBr 42 -. Finally, XANES spectra were used to derive the thermodynamic properties for the CoCl 42 and CoCl 2 (H 2 O) (2 (aq)) complexes, enabling thermodynamic modelling of cobalt transport in hydrothermal fluids. Solubility calculations show that tetrahedral CoCl 42 - is responsible for transport of cobalt in hydrothermal solutions with moderate chloride concentration (similar to 2 m NaCl) at temperatures of 250 degrees C and higher, and both cooling and dilution processes can cause deposition of cobalt from hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
40|$|Zirconia {{ceramics}} {{have become}} popular in dentistry, {{due to their}} superior biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties (fracture toughness and strength) and high aesthetic potential. In restorative dentistry, 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia polycrystalline (3 Y-TZP) ceramics have been widely accepted as a promising material for fabricating dental crowns and more importantly for fixed partial dentures (FPD) in both anterior and stress-bearing posterior area. However, 3 Y-TZP ceramics suffer from low-temperature degradation (LTD), i. e. the spontaneous transformation of the tetragonal to monoclinic ZrO 2 phase {{in the presence of}} water (hydrothermal aging). Hydrothermal aging can result in enhanced wear rates with the release of small zirconia particles in the surrounding environment, roughening of the surface finish, aesthetic degradation, loss of mechanical properties and even catastrophic failure. This doctoral research focuses on understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of <b>hydrothermal</b> aging by <b>processing</b> and investigating different experimental 3 Y-TZP ceramics. The aim is to develop aging-resistant 3 Y-TZP ceramics without compromising their high strength and fracture toughness, and aesthetics. A linear relationship between the transformed depth and the aging time was observed for all investigated 3 Y-TZPs, and the tensile stress accumulation at the transformation front could be primarily responsible for transformation front propagating into the material. The linear kinetics of the transformation propagation was also shown to be more accurate to calculate the apparent activation energy of the aging process and allowed a more straightforward way to estimate the lifetime of 3 Y-TZP at body temperature, compared with the conventional aging kinetic parameters obtained from the phase transformation analysis on the surface. Apart from the normally reported factors like grain size, stabilizer type and stabilizer content, the zirconia grain boundaries were found to {{play a key role in}} the hydrothermal aging behavior of 3 Y-TZP ceramics. Tailoring the composition of the zirconia grain boundaries at the nanometer level by adding only a slight amount of trivalent oxide provided a satisfactory strategy to balance between the aging resistance and the mechanical properties. The use of Y 2 O 3 -stabilizer coated ZrO 2 starting powder resulted innbsp;combination of higher toughness and aging resistance, as compared to stabilizer co-precipitated starting powder. The grain boundaries were more enriched in Y 3 + in Y 2 O 3 -coated 3 Y-TZPs, indicating the crucial role of the zirconia grain boundary. More clear evidence was obtained by doping 3 Y-TZP ceramics with a small amount of trivalent oxides (Al 2 O 3, Sc 2 O 3, Nd 2 O 3 or La 2 O 3) which have a different cation radius (Al 3 + (53. 5 pm) Nd 3 + > Al 3 +). It was found that the ionic conductivity (especially grain boundary conductivity) and aging resistance were oppositely influenced by the cation radius of the dopant, which strongly proved the fact that hydrothermal aging is driven by the diffusion of water-derived mobile species through the oxygen vacancies. Accordingly, the depletion of oxygen vacancies at the zirconia grain boundary makes the grain boundary vulnerable to hydrothermal aging. The trivalent cations which have a strong segregation effect at the grain boundary andnbsp;can form strong defect clusters are able to inhibit the mobility of the oxygen vacancies and thereby retard the aging kinetics of 3 Y-TZP ceramics. Furthermore, it was observed that the grain growth of tetragonal zirconia can be limited by the addition of larger cations segregating at the zirconia grain boundary. Although large trivalent dopant cations with a strong segregation to the ZrO 2 grain boundary are preferred to design hydrothermally stable and highly-translucent 3 Y-TZP ceramics, the amount of the trivalent dopant was critical. There was an optimum amount resulting in the highest aging resistance of 3 Y-TZPs in the case of Al 2 O 3 (optimum 0. 25 wt. %), Nd 2 O 3 (optimum 0. 4 - 0. 6 mol%) and La 2 O 3 (optimum 0. 2 - 0. 4 mol%) dopant. A higher dopant content on the contrary could form secondary phases or bimodal microstructure, reducing the aging resistance or translucency. At last, the introduction of 0. 2 mol% La 2 O 3 in conventional Al 2 O 3 -doped 3 Y-TZP resulted in a unique combination of high translucency (42 % increase compared to conventional 0. 25 wt. % alumina-doped 3 Y-TZP) and superior hydrothermal stability (no transformation up to 120 h of hydrothermal aging at 134 °C), while retaining the excellent mechanical properties (fracture toughness and strength). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Panax ginseng Meyer is {{cultivated}} {{because of}} its medicinal effects on the immune system, blood pressure, and cancer. Major ginsenosides in fresh ginseng are converted to minor ginsenosides by structural changes such as hydrolysis and dehydration. The transformed ginsenosides are generally more bioavailable and bioactive than the primary ginsenosides. Therefore, in this study, <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> was applied to ginseng preparation to increase the yields of the transformed ginsenosides, such as 20 (S) -Rg 3, Rk 1, and Rg 5, and enhance antioxidant activities in an effective way. Methods: Ginseng extract was hydrothermally processed using batch reactors at 100 – 160 °C with differing reaction times. Quantitative analysis of the ginsenoside yields was performed using HPLC, and the antioxidant activity was qualitatively analyzed by evaluating 2, 2 '-azino-bis radical cation scavenging, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, and phenolic antioxidants. Red ginseng and sun ginseng were prepared by conventional steaming as the control group. Results: Unlike steaming, the hydrothermal process was performed under homogeneous conditions. Chemical reaction, heat transfer, and mass transfer are generally more efficient in homogeneous reactions. Therefore, maximum yields for the hydrothermal process were 2. 5 – 25 times higher than those for steaming, and the antioxidant activities showed 1. 6 – 4 -fold increases for the hydrothermal process. Moreover, the reaction time was decreased from 3 h to 15 – 35 min using <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing.</b> Conclusion: Therefore, <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> offers significant improvements over the conventional steaming process. In particular, at temperatures over 140 °C, high yields of the transformed ginsenosides and increased antioxidant activities were obtained in tens of minutes...|$|E
40|$|We used {{response}} surface methodology {{to investigate the}} effect of time and temperature of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> (blanching) on the phytochemical content, texture and colour of a semi-dried brown seaweed (Himanthalia elongata). A central composite design was employed with a <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> time of 10 – 30 min and temperature of 60 – 90 ° C. Predicted models {{were found to be}} signifi cant for total phenolic content, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, total fl avonoids, total condensed tannins, texture and colour. The predicted values for each of the responses were in good agreement with experimental values. Processing time had the most signifi cant effect on phytochemical constituents of H. elongata. An acceptable edible texture and colour of seaweed was also achieved during the blanching procedure. Thus, central composite design and {{response surface}} methodology can be used to model phytochemical content, texture and colour of H. elongata while minimising the number of experiments required. Multiple response optimisation demonstrated that the phytochemical content of H. elongata may be maximised by blanching for 20. 4 min at 80. 5 ° C...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examined particles created by laser-driven <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing,</b> an innovative technique {{used for the}} ablation of submerged materials. Two naturally occurring materials, obsidian and tektite, were used as targets for this technique. Characterization of sample materials before and after laser processing was conducted through multiple techniques such as optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Examination of the untreated base material, in bulk and crushed form, established a baseline for comparison to particles created by laser processing of the same material. Characterization methods provided data of micron- and nano-sized particles, including their crystal structure, microstructure, and chemical composition. The bulk and crushed obsidian and tektite samples contained inclusions and particles rich in several transition elements, most notably iron and titanium. Analysis of liquid media collected after laser processing of bulk obsidian and tektite samples revealed fine particles rich in the same elements. Evidence suggests laser-driven <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>processing</b> separates heavy elements from the mostly amorphous silica matrix encountered in the materials examined.
