50|$|<b>Fusafungine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as fusafungin, is an active agent used in {{antibiotics}} for treatment of nasal and throat infection. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Fusafungine</b> {{is a mixture of}} enniatin cyclohexadepsipeptides made up of alternating D-α-hydroxyvaleric acid and L-N-methylamino acid residues, produced by the ascomycete Fusarium lateritium, and marketed by Servier under the trade names Locabiotal, Bioparox, and Locabiosol.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016, the European Medicines Agency {{recommended}} to withdraw <b>fusafungine</b> {{from the market}} due to rare but severe allergic reactions (mainly bronchospasms).|$|E

40|$|<b>Fusafungine</b> is an {{antibiotic}} of fungal origin with a potent local anti-inflammatory action (German-Fattal, 1995; German-Fattal, 1996). It is administered locally to the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa by spray. It can be hypothesised that the anti-inflammatory action of <b>fusafungine</b> may decrease {{the development of}} mucosa! inflammation {{in such a manner}} that the incidence of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection may be reduced if it is administered before, during and after completion of an ultramarathon. Furthermore, <b>fusafungine</b> could also reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection.

40|$|Among the sickly children, pharyngitis and {{tonsillopharyngitis}} {{are quite}} {{often accompanied by}} pain and scratch in a throat, which is anguished for a child themselves and causes parents to worry. In the therapy for the indicated pathology, a certain place is held by a local antibiotic <b>fusafungine.</b> In the article, the author studies the effects of <b>fusafungine</b> on tonsillitis/tonsillopharyngitis and pharyngitis, running with pain in a throat, among the sickly children aged between 3 and 15. The research was carried on in 42 centers of different Russian regions and {{became a part of}} the multicentered research according to «Chibis» program. 2, 609 children were examined, 1, 907 of who Received <b>fusafungine</b> and 702 children did not. Among 78, 1 % of the children, the authors noted the phenomena of pharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis and acute tonsillopharyngitis. As the research showed the symptoms of rhinopharyngitis and tonsillopharync gitis were reliably arrested much faster, when applying <b>fusafungine,</b> thus, the clinical effects mostly emerged after 4 th– 5 t h day of the therapy. The acquired data allowed one to recommend the inclusion of <b>fusafungine</b> into the therapy for acute rhinopharyngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillopharyngitis among the sickly children.

40|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections are generally mild {{but they are}} associated with an enormous loss in productivity. Treatment consists of reduction of local symptoms e. g. local inflammation and prevention of potential superinfections. Besides its bacteriostatic activity against most micro-organisms involved in {{respiratory tract}} infections <b>fusafungine</b> displays original anti-inflammatory properties. To optimise nasal and throat deposition, a new <b>fusafungine</b> oro-nasal spray using HFA 134 a was developed and its efficacy was evaluated in patients with acute rhinopharyngitis based on improvement of significant nasal symptoms. Three randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group studies with identical objectives design and dosage were performed and results were pooled for a better evaluation of treatment effect (532 patients). The percentage of responders (patients with nasal symptom score improvement from Day 0 to Day 4) was 61. 5 +/- 2. 9 % with <b>fusafungine</b> vs 46. 8 +/- 3. 1 % with placebo (p= 0. 009) with an odds ratio of 1. 8 (p= 0. 01) in favour of <b>fusafungine.</b> The nasal symptom score distribution at Day 4 showed an odds ratio of 1. 56 (p= 0. 011) also in favour of <b>fusafungine.</b> For patients treated early (onset of symptoms $ 1 day) the percentage of responders was 65. 9 +/- 4. 1 % with fusqfungine vs 38. 3 +/- 4. 0 % with placebo (p= 0. 022) with an odds ratio of 3. 08 (p= 0. 033) in favour of <b>fusafungine.</b> Therefore <b>fusafungine</b> through its dual bacteriostatic and original anti-inflammatory properties is an effective treatment of acute rhinopharyngitis especially when administered early...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotic resistance, the {{important}} public health threat, depends on antibiotic overuse/misuse. Self-medication with antibiotics is of serious medical concern. The {{aim of the}} study, {{as a part of}} SAR project (Self-medication with antibiotic in Europe) was to survey the incidence of this phenomenon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In Poland among 938 respondents of the questionnaire 27 % adults were treated with antibiotics at least once a year, 13 % of the therapies were undertaken without medical consultation. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin, the most often self-ordered [...] <b>fusafungine.</b> RESULTS: The main self-medicated symptoms were sore throat and common cold. The duration of self-ordered therapy was less then 5 days. The sources of antibiotics used for self-medication were leftovers and those given by friends or family.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modulation of {{intercellular}} adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression {{may be a}} basic {{mechanism by}} which alveolar macrophages (AMs) regulate the inflammatory process in the lung in response to local stimuli. As a model for studying the anti-inflammatory activity of drugs on human AMs, we investigated the effects of <b>fusafungine,</b> an antibiotic for local use by aerosol with anti-inflammatory properties, {{and that of the}} glucocorticoid dexamethasone, on ICAM- 1 expression induced in vitro by recombinant interferon-γ (rIFN-γ). ICAM- 1 protein expression was studied on AMs by means of flow cytometry with an anti-CD 54 monoclonal antibody; messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were deter-mined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ICAM- 1 was expressed before culture on 21 % of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, with low intensity. Culture for 24 h with rIFN-γ resulted in a significant increase in ICAM- 1 protein expression (82 % of cells were strongly positive). Fusa-fungine significantly inhibited rIFN-γ-induced ICAM- 1 -protein expression on AMs in a concentration-dependent fashion. The mechanism of ICAM- 1 downregulatio...|$|E
