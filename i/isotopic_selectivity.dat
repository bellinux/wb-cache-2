40|$|This study {{focuses on}} an {{interesting}} and important phenomenon that was employed in {{a new approach to}} laser isotope separation that has been recently proposed and developed in our laboratory for highly selective separation of carbon isotopes. This approach consists of pre-exciting CF 3 H molecules with the desired isotope to a low vibrational overtone of the CH-stretch with a subsequent selective infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) of only the pre-excited molecules by a CO 2 -laser pulse. Significant isotopic shifts of the employed CH overtone bands already allow high selectivity at the pre-excitation step. This selectivity, however, can be further greatly increased by increasing the pressure of the sample gas and/or the delay between the two laser pulses; that is, by increasing the number of molecular collisions during the process. At first glance, the observed effect contradicts the general expectations that the <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> of such a process should drop with {{an increase in the number}} of collisions because of vibrational energy transfer between different isotopic species. In this work we have studied this phenomenon and found its physical origins. We propose the contribution of two different mechanisms to the observed enhancement of <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> by collisions. First, the vibrational collisional relaxation itself is isotopically selective, that is vibrationally excited 12 CF 3 H relax on the bath of cold, 12 CF 3 H, molecules faster than the excited 13 CF 3 H do on the same bath. The primary reason for such a selectivity could be a significant isotopic shift of the vibration (CF-stretch, we believe) that mediates the energy transfer. A second mechanism arises from the difference between the IRMPD probabilities of the two isotopic species by the CO 2 laser tuned to a particular wavelength that enhances the dissociation yield of the targeted, carbon- 13, species. As collisional deactivation of both species increases the number of photons they have to absorb to be dissociated, this difference in dissociation probability increases as well, yielding an additional <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> of the process. We perform a set of experiments and numerical simulations to investigate these two mechanisms. Experimentally we find that, indeed, collisional vibrational deactivation of CF 3 H is isotopically selective. This is, perhaps, the first direct observation of isotopically selective collisional relaxation of highly excited medium-sized molecules. At low pressures and increased time-delay between the lasers both suggested mechanisms contribute equally to the enhancement of <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> (with a slight dominance of the IRMPD step). We also perform numerical simulations of vibrational energy transfer (VET) between highly excited and cold CF 3 H of both isotopic species. The model we employ includes V-V energy transfer due to long-range dipole-dipole interactions and V-V',T,R energy transfer due to head-on collisions between two molecules. The results reproduce well the measured <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> in vibrational energy transfer. At the next step, we propose a model for the simulation of the laser isotope separation process. We solve the master equations including vibrational energy transfer and absorption and stimulated emission of IR photons. The main improvement of our calculations with respect to existing models is that we introduce a dependence of the absorption/emission rates on the frequency of the laser, the internal energy of the molecule and its isotopic species. We are able to reproduce our experiments numerically and thus gain information on the laser isotope separation process. In particular, we find that at high sample pressures the mechanism of isotopically selective IRMPD rates prevails over the mechanism of different collisional relaxation rates...|$|E

In this study, the structure of the CNT/polymer hybrid formed in water is evaluated by measurements of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation, as supported by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging. The homogeneous, stable, inklike dispersions exhibited very small isolated bundles of carbon nanotubes in cryo-TEM images. SANS experiments were conducted at different D(2) O/H(2) O content of the dispersing solvent.

Such developments include Ž. solid-state tunable lasers, deep UV tunable lasers, the use of charge coupled detectors CCDs, and the applications of LEAFS for trace metal determination in various samples. The advent of diode lasers with their now somewhat improved range of wavelengths and power output, provides opportunities for research and applications in LEAFS. The further development of the coupling of second and third harmonic crystals to pulsed diode lasers shows promise for compact and robust instrumentation. There have been no recent instrumental developments that might provide more <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> beyond the elements like uranium where the spectral isotope splitting is greater than most elements, but laser diodes could provide this due to their potential to provide an output with very narrow spectral bandwidth.

We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic data from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and isotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous work. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by atomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the rare isotopologues C 17 O and 13 C 17 O. We couple it to a simple chemical network to analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated regions, and circumstellar disks. Results.

The study of isotopically selective OP-IRMPD of CF 3 H resulted in a qualitative understanding of the dynamics of the OP-IRMPD process under collisional conditions. This understanding prompted us to make some crucial improvements which made the OP-IRMPD based approach to laser separation of carbon isotopes economically feasible. The typical value of <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> reached in our experiments is 2000 - 3000 at the highest yield and can be further increased up to at least 7000 - 8000 with a simultaneous drop in productivity. We have also performed an estimation of the required parameters for an industrial-scale separation and of the energy consumption by a single separation act. The experimental study of OP-IRMPD of the SiHCl 3 molecule has shown a limited applicability of this approach on this molecule for highly selective silicon isotope separation due to the low discrimination in the dissociation of pre-excited vs. ground state molecules under the conditions of moderate dissociation yield. Overtone pre-excitation of the ammonia molecule makes its multiphoton dissociation considerably easier and allows a high level of discrimination in dissociation of pre-excited vs. ground state molecules. However the high fluence of the dissociation laser required for effective multiphoton excitation of NH 3 makes the OP-IRMPD approach on this molecule impractical for MLIS. We have shown that the probability of the dissociation of a pre-excited ammonia molecule depends on the pre-excitation level and on the wavelength of the dissociation laser...|$|E
40|$|Aims. Photodissociation by UV {{light is}} an {{important}} destruction mechanism for CO in many astrophysical environments, ranging from interstellar clouds to protoplanetary disks. The aim of this work is {{to gain a better}} understanding of the depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process. Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic data from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and isotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous work. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by atomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the rare isotopologues C 17 O and 13 C 17 O. We couple it to a simple chemical network to analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated regions, and circumstellar disks. Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar radiation field is 2. 6 e- 10 s^- 1, 30 % higher than currently adopted values. Increasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the photodissociation rates and the <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> by as much as a factor of three for temperatures above 100 K. The model reproduces column densities observed towards diffuse clouds and PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both the enhanced and the reduced N(12 CO) /N(13 CO) ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The photodissociation of C 17 O and 13 C 17 O shows almost exactly the same depth dependence as that of C 18 O and 13 C 18 O, respectively, so 17 O and 18 O are equally fractionated with respect to 16 O. This supports the recent hypothesis that CO photodissociation in the solar nebula is responsible for the anomalous 17 O and 18 O abundances in meteorites. Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrared}} multiphoton dissociation (MPD) of trifluorobromomethane (CF(, 3) Br), ketene, and 1 -chloro- 1 -fluoroethylene (CH(, 2) CClF) {{has been}} investigated. ^ CF(, 3) Br was photolyzed using the R(12) to R(34) {{lines of the}} 00 (DEGREES) 1 - 02 (DEGREES) 0 CO(, 2) laser transition (9. 317 - 9. 201 (mu)). The effects of pulse number, pressure, and exciting wavelength were investigated. Products were determined by end-product analysis and a reaction scheme is proposed {{to account for the}} observed products and their dependence on the experimental conditions. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> of the multiphoton process in CF(, 3) Br was also investigated. Comparisons are presented between the results on CF(, 3) Br and those of other freons and SF(, 6). ^ Ketene was photolyzed at 9. 260 (mu). Products were determined by end-product analysis and monitoring of visible luminescence. The pressure dependence of the dissociation was also studied. A collision-assisted dissociation, followed by rephotolysis of the transient products is proposed to account for the results. Comparisons between the IR multiphoton dissociation and ultraviolet dissociation are also presented. ^ CH(, 2) CClF was photolyzed at two different wavelengths, 10. 632 (mu) (P(24) of the 00 (DEGREES) 1 - 10 (DEGREES) 0 CO(, 2) laser transition) and 9. 552 (mu) (P(20) of the 00 (DEGREES) 1 - 02 (DEGREES) 0 CO(, 2) laser transition). Two dissociation pathways were observed: elimination of HF and elimination of HCl. The dissociation processes were followed in real time by monitoring the IR fluorescence of the above two species. The effects of laser energy, bath gas pressure, and exciting wavelength upon the dissociation processes were investigated. The results are explained in terms of competition between the reaction pathways, optical pumping rates, and the rate of intermolecular energy transfer. ^ Numerical modelling of the multiphoton process using energy-grained master equations is also presented. The validity and application of this approach is discussed. Results of modelling the fluence and pressure results of the MPD of CH(, 2) CClF are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The Cassini-Huygens mission {{recently}} provided {{measurements of}} the abundance of nitrogen isotopes in Titan's atmosphere. The 14 N/ 15 N ratio in the two most abundant N-bearing molecules in Titan's atmosphere {{was found to be}} 183 × 5 for N 2 [1] and 56 × 8 for HCN [2]. Those two molecules are greatly enriched in the heavier isotope 15 N compared to our terrestrial atmosphere and Titan's HCN is about three times richer in 15 N than its potential photochemical precursor N 2. This implies an important fractionation process in the HCN production chain, which is tentatively attributed to an <b>isotopic</b> <b>selectivity</b> of the photodissociation of N 2 in Titan's ionosphere [3 - 4]. The organic aerosols, forming the Titan's orange characteristic haze layers, also contain large amounts of nitrogen [5], and thus represent a third important nitrogen reservoir in Titan's atmosphere. These organic aerosols are presumably produced in the upper atmosphere by chemical reactions between N 2 and CH 4 induced by solar radiation and electron bombardment from Saturn's magnetosphere. As HCN is a possible precursor for aerosol polymerization [6 - 7], the 15 N enrichment observed in HCN may be linked to the polymerization process. Unfortunately, no data exists on the isotopic nitrogen abundance in Titan's aerosols, and this question remains open. To address this issue, laboratory aerosols analogues have been produced in a N 2 -CH 4 plasma and their nitrogen isotopic composition have been investigated. In this study, the experimental aerosols, called " tholins ", have been synthetized in the PAMPRE reactor (LATMOS, France). This setup is dedicated to simulate chemical processes occurring in Titan's atmosphere and consists in an RF plasma discharge initiated in a N 2 -CH 4 gas mixture at room temperature [8 - 9]. For our purpose, tholins were produced at different initial CH 4 percentages (1, 2, 5, 10 %), representative of the variation of the CH 4 concentration in Titan's atmosphere. 15 N/ 14 N ratio of the N 2 gas used in the initial gas mixture was analyzed by dual-inlet and tholins nitrogen isotopes were measured by EA-IRMS. PAMPRE tholins are depleted in 15 N by - 15 to - 25 ‰ relative to the initial N 2. Comparison of this nitrogen isotopic fractionation with a N 2 -CO-H 2 O plasma experiment done in very similar experimental conditions and resulting in a very close 15 N depletion, has led us to interpret this 15 N depletion between N 2 and organic aerosols as a kinetic isotopic fractionation occurring during N 2 dissociation in the plasma. This nitrogen isotopic fractionation, although important and larger than what is observed in natural terrestrial samples, is weak compared to what is measured in Titan's atmosphere for N 2 and HCN. This apparent inconsistency will be discussed. [1] Niemann et al. (2010) JGR, 115, 1151 - 1154. [2] Vinatier et al. (2007) Icarus, 191, 712 - 721. [3] Liang et al. (2007) Ap. J. Lett., 664, L 115.
