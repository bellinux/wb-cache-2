The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. <b>Growth</b> <b>factors</b> and cytotoxic factors may also be released.

Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells.

These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF.

Methods: Vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> messenger RNA expression levels, relative to the control gene encoding β-actin, were measured by using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (ABI 7700 Sequence Detector system) in specimens of Barrett intestinal metaplasia (n = 16), dysplasia (n = 11), adenocarcinoma (n = l 5), and matching normal squamous esophageal tissues (n = 35). Vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> protein expression and CD 31 + microvessel density were assessed by means of immunohistochemistry in 25 tissue sections that included representative areas for each of these Barrett stages. Results: Expression levels were significantly increased in adenocarcinoma compared with in either normal squamous mucosa (P <. 0001 for both genes) or intestinal metaplasia (vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> P =. 002; basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> P <. 0001). Vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> levels were also significantly higher in cancer tissues compared with dysplasia tissues (P =. 024, Mann-Whitney U test). Basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> expression was also significantly increased in Barrett dysplastic mucosa compared with in intestinal metaplasia or normal esophageal mucosa. Microvessel density was generally higher in adenocarcinoma compared with in preneoplastic Barrett tissues. The pattern of vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> protein expression was similar to the messenger RNA expression pattern, with the exception that mucin-containing goblet cells stained intensely for vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and only weak vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> staining was present in some adenocarcinomas. Conclusions: Vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> messenger RNA expression levels are significantly upregulated in esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas, suggesting a role for these angiogenic factors in the development of these cancers. Vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> messenger RNA expression levels are also increased in some Barrett esophagus tissues, with this increase occurring at an earlier stage for basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> than for vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor.</b> Basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> protein expression pattern is similar to the messenger RNA expression pattern, but unlike the messenger RNA findings, vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> protein expression is strongest in goblet cells.
