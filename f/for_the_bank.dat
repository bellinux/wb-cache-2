The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennas, and eyes, contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function.

5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda.

5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of China Tower {{was not only}} unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} on {{the takeover}} of Prijedor by Serb forces was prepared by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor {{the day after the}} takeover. Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in the takeover, the objective of which was to seize the functions {{of the president of the}} municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, {{the takeover of}} power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the takeover by the Serb politicians was an illegal coup d'état, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

5|$|Pei's {{first major}} {{recognition}} {{came with the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts. He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. He returned to China {{for the first time}} in 1975 to design a hotel at Fragrant Hills, and designed Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong, a skyscraper in Hong Kong <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of China fifteen years later. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed a glass-and-steel pyramid for the Musée du Louvre in Paris. He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, the Miho Museum in Japan, the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou, and the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|The Wirgman Building was {{an early}} 19th-century Federal-style {{commercial}} and residential building located on East Main Street (U.S. Route 50) in Romney, West Virginia. Following its completion around 1825 {{to serve as the}} Romney branch office <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of the Valley of Virginia, the Wirgman Building at various times served as a location for every subsequent bank established in Romney, to include the Bank of Romney and the First National Bank of Romney. During the American Civil War, the building was used as a military prison. For a time, the Wirgman Building's second floor housed the offices and printing plant of the Hampshire Review newspaper. By 1937, the ground floor of the Wirgman Building housed office and mercantile space, and the second floor was divided into apartments. After the Wirgman Building sustained damage in a fire in 1964, it was demolished in 1965 {{to make way for the}} construction of the new Bank of Romney headquarters building. Prior to its demolition, the Wirgman Building was photographed and documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey in 1937.|$|E

Third, using results from supervisory inspection on <b>the</b> secondary market <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> assets increases <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> incentive to misreport its quality.
