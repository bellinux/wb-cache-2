40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the implications of}} recent financial crises affecting emerging economies in the 1990 's points to the failure by private markets and other relevant institutions to meet the demand for cross-border and domestic short-term trade-finance in such periods, thereby affecting, in some countries and for certain periods, imports and exports to a point of stoppage. These experiences seem to suggest that there is scope for carefully targeted public intervention, as currently proposed by regional development banks and other actors, which have put in place ad-hoc schemes to maintain a minimum flow of trade finance during periods of scarcity, through systems of direct <b>credit</b> <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees.</b> This paper explores the reasons behind the drying up of trade finance, both short and long-term, in particular as banks tend to concentrate on the more profitable and less risky segments of credit markets. It also describes ad-hoc schemes put in place by regional and multilateral institutions to keep minimal amounts of trade finance available at any time. It then goes on to examine a number of questions regarding the regulatory framework surrounding trade finance products, and looks at WTO rules in this regard. It also examines other areas where the WTO can play a role in facilitating and contributing to a global solution. In this context, a discussion of various proposals on the table is suggested...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{empirical}} tests for financial protectionism, {{defined as a}} nationalistic change in banks' lending behaviour, {{as the result of}} public intervention, which leads domestic banks either to lend less or at higher interest rates to foreigners. We use a bank-level panel data set spanning all British and foreign banks providing loans within the United Kingdom between 1997 Q 3 and 2010 Q 1. During this time, a number of banks were nationalised, privatised, given unusual access to loan <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees,</b> <b>or</b> received capital injections. We use standard empirical panel-data techniques to study the 'loan mix', domestic (British) loans of a bank expressed as a fraction of its total loan activity. We also study effective short-term interset rates, though our data set here is much smaller. We examine the loan mix for both British and foreign banks, both before and after unusual public interventions such as nationalisations and public capital injections. We find strong evidence of financial protectionism. After nationalisations, foreign banks reduced the fraction of loans going to the United Kingdom by around 11 precentage points and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis points. By way of contrast, nationalised British banks did not significantly change either their loan mix or effect interest rates. Succinctly, foreign nationalised banks seem to have engaged in financial protectionism, while British nationalised banks have not.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{understanding}} the role of public development banks in alleviating financial market imperfections. We explore two issues: 1) which types of firms should be optimally targeted by public financial support; and 2) what type of mechanism should be implemented in order to efficiently support the targeted firms access to credit. We model firms that face moral hazard and banks that have a costly screening technology, which results in a limited access to credit for some firms. We show that a public development bank may alleviate the inefficiencies by lending to commercial banks at subsidized rates, targeting the firms that generate high added value. This may be implemented through subsidized ear-marked lending to the banks <b>or</b> through <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> which we show to be equivalent in "normal times". Still, when banks are facing a liquidity shortage, lending is preferred, while when banks are undercapitalized, a <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> program is best suited. This will imply that 1) there is no "one size fits all" intervention program and 2) that any intervention program should be fine-tuned to accommodate the characteristics of competition, collateral, liquidity and banks capitalization of each industry...|$|R

40|$|Subnational debt {{markets can}} be a {{powerful}} force in a country's development. Through delegated monitoring by financial intermediaries and through debt placed directly with investors, subnational debt markets account for about 5 percent of GDP in Argentina and Brazil. But they remain embryonic in most developing and transition economies. To resolve a potential clash between the increased financing needs of subnational entities and the limited development of domestic subnational debt markets, it is critical to support the orderly, efficient emergence of such debt markets. As a framework for policy reform, the following steps (mirroring typical weaknesses) are prerequisites for developing a country's subnational debt market: reducing moral hazard, improving market transparency, strengthening market governance, establishing a level playing field, and developing local capacity for accounting, budgeting, and financial management. In countries where the government shows a clear commitment to market development, says the author, the World Bank should support the framework needed for policy-based operations that establish hard budget constraints. In doing so, the Bank should concentrate on 1) supporting national and local capacity building in those areas essential for developing a subnational debt market; and 2) financing specific subnational projects with strictly nonrecourse loans. At the same time, the Bank should offer a variety of lending and guarantee instruments that encourage private financing for investments by subnational entities-including, for example, equity participation in (<b>or</b> lines of <b>credit</b> <b>or</b> partial <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to) financial intermediaries specializing in subnational investment finance or in funds for financing local infrastructure.
