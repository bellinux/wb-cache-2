5|$|After {{the battle}} Żółkiewski's corpse was desecrated by {{the removal of}} <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sent to Constantinople as a trophy of war. His widow bought his body from the Turks and ransomed their son, who had been {{captured}} during the battle. Żółkiewski was buried in St Lawrence Church in Żółkiew (now Zhovkva, Ukraine), the town he enlarged and where he built the Żółkiew Castle.|$|E
5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E

5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> thorax.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> sways it {{from side to}} side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E

5|$|Composed of a torso, the Maxberg Specimen (S5) was {{discovered}} in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it {{was brought to the}} attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> back {{when confronted by}} a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow or mossie (Passer melanurus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae {{found in}} {{southern}} Africa. A medium-sized sparrow at , it has distinctive plumage, including large pale head stripes in both sexes. Its plumage is mostly coloured grey, brown, and chestnut, {{and the male}} has some bold black and white markings on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck. The species inhabits semi-arid savannah, cultivated areas, and towns, and ranges from the central coast of Angola to eastern South Africa and Swaziland. Three subspecies are distinguished {{in different parts of}} its range.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E

5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E
5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its digestive tract {{are typical of}} those of other predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes. The organism was clearly a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth guitarfish. The ray is {{protected}} by the thorns on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> back, and it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the trematode Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a bowmouth guitarfish being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus).|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat, which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends <b>its</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E
