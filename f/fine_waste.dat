40|$|Abstract. The {{practice}} of impounding mine water and liquid <b>fine</b> <b>waste</b> in underground mines is increasing. Often these underground impoundments {{are created by}} constructing seals or bulkheads designed to withstand the expected hydraulic pressures.

The incidence of seal failures due to inadequate design and/or construction {{is also on the}} increase. Fortunately, to date, no lives have been lost by water seal failures, but a clearer understanding of the design and construction considerations specific to water seals is vital to keep this from occurring in the future.

The <b>fine</b> coal <b>waste</b> slurry is rapidly thickened (i. e., dewatered) and deposited on a slightly sloping surface. To accomplish rapid dewatering, a chemical flocculation system using polymers was developed to treat the <b>fine</b> coal <b>waste</b> slurry stream.

During the last 5 days of the field test, slurry flowing at rates from 498 to 675 gal/min with a specific gravity range of 1. 15 to 1. 33 was successfully treated and dewatered. During this period, untreated slurry had an average moisture content of 227. 4 pct (30. 7 wt pct solids).

40|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{process for the}} {{reduction}} of iron ore to pig iron faces problems such as emission of air pollutants, high investment cost and the current major problem of decreasing supplies of coke. Coke is used in large quantities to promote a combination of direct and indirect reduction within the furnace. Due {{to the lack of}} good coking coal within South Africa, and dwindling supplies worldwide, new iron-making processes, are being developed using coal and/or natural gas to replace coke as the reductant. The new processes allow efficient use of carbon, fed in the form of coal pellets (coal-based processes) or natural gas (gas-based processes), as the reducing agent. Presently, most coal-based processes Use an excess of coal, up to 500 % stoichoimetric addition, and are run at temperatures up to ± 1200 °C, although reduction tends to proceed at ± 850 °C.

40|$|Fast {{increasing}} {{of generation}} and release of undesirable pollutants by the industrialization raise {{concerns about the}} environmental consequences of waste disposal. Among these waste materials, non-recycled waste glass constitutes one of the majority wastes produced in many European countries and sets a major environmental issue. Although glass could be recycled into the packaging stream without significantly changing its chemical and physical properties, {{there is still a}} significant proportion, which does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass, to be sent to landfill. Waste glass is not a biodegradable material, which made landfilling waste glass become a highly unsustainable option. To find a better solution to reduce the environmental issues caused by disposal of waste glass, alkaline activation technology is introduced to use waste glass into alkali activated materials (AAMs) to produce construction materials. Waste glass is believed to have the potential to serve as precursor material in geopolymer production because of abundant amount of amorphous silica in a structure that does not reflect long range order. However, limited research has been conducted on waste glass as precursor material in AAMs, neither is the utilization of waste glass as replacement for binder precursor like fly ash. Currently, the feasibility of using waste glass in geopolymer systems is still largely unknown. This research project aims at {{a better understanding of the}} feasibility of using waste glass powder as partial binder precursor to create AAMs along with fly ash and slag and also the feasibility of using <b>fine</b> <b>waste</b> glass aggregate as partial aggregate replacement in geopolymer mortar. The main focus of this research is on the reactivity of waste glass powder and its influence on the microstructure development and gel formation, with correlation with mechanical strength. It has been found that: Waste glass powder, which is dominantly in irregular polygonal shape, has much finer particles size distribution and larger specific surface area compared with fly ash and slag. It has abundant amorphous Si and Ca, and has higher reactivity than fly ash. Waste glass powder serves as effective precursor replacement for fly ash in alkali activated slag/fly ash system. <b>Fine</b> <b>waste</b> glass aggregate is possible to be utilized to replace sand in alkali activated mortars when suitable workability is taken care off. This study provides a better insight on properties of waste glass powder as well as promotes understanding of the influence of waste glass powder on microstructure and gel formation, which is essential for future research and engineering application of this kind of waste material.

The ceramic powder is used in cement based pastes composition in cement mass replacements of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 %. For the tested pastes, monitoring of strength development is done using measurement of time dependent mechanical parameters. Bulk density, matrix density, and total open porosity are measured for 28 days cured samples. In order to obtain information on the rate of hydration process, the formation of pastes' solid structure is monitored using measurement of pore size distribution at chosen times of hydration.

In all formulations, a polyester resin matrix was modified with a silane coupling agent in order to improve binder-aggregates interfaces. The added value of the recycling solution was assessed by means of both flexural and compressive strengths of GFRP admixed mortars with regard to those of the unmodified polymer mortars. Planning of experiments and data treatment were performed by means of full factorial design and through appropriate statistical tools based on analyses of variance (ANOVA). Results show that the partial replacement of sand aggregates by either type of GFRP recyclates improves the mechanical performance of resultant polymer mortars. In the case of trial formulations modified with the coarser waste mix, the best results are achieved with 8 % waste weight content, while for <b>fine</b> <b>waste</b> based polymer mortars, 4 % in weight of waste content leads to the higher increases on mechanical strengths.

Surface water and groundwater samples were collected from the Moulouya River and mine pit lakes; tailings and soils were sampled inside and outside the mine sites of Ze < da, Mibladen, and Aouli. Both waters and soils were alkaline, due to the limestone environment, and contained Pb and Zn as main metallic contaminants. Pollution levels were highest within the Mibladen mining site, and soil pollution was mainly restricted to the areas where activities of metal concentration were carried out. Tailings and soils from these areas besides Pb and Zn were also polluted by As, Cd, and Cu showing clay fraction highly enriched in metal contaminants. At the time of study, all soils and wastes (including the highly polluted tailings) were in advanced stage of spontaneous herbaceous and arbustive revegetation. It is concluded that, in the High Moulouya Valley, the processes governing PTM transfer from the element-rich sites to the nearby environment are strongly influenced by pH, carbonate content, and semi-arid climate reducing metal mobility from the mining waste impoundments by dissolution. The transfer by wind and water erosion of metal-enriched <b>fine</b> <b>waste</b> particles is likely to be a much more important vector for metal dispersion.

We set out to determine the potential value of silt lagoons to wading birds by comparing the water quality, sediment profiles, aquatic invertebrate abundance and diversity (prey availability) and wader site use at five sites representing various stages of active aggregate extraction and restoration for conservation purposes. Wader counts were conducted monthly over a twelve month period using replicated scan samples, and the invertebrate communities studied during the breeding and autumn migration season (June–September). Water quality variables were similar between sites, but sediments from active quarries were dominated by moderately sorted fine sands in comparison to the coarser sediment profiles of restored areas. June and September {{there was no significant difference}} in invertebrate diversity between sites, however richness was significantly lower on quarry sites and total abundance a factor of ten higher at restored sites than on silt lagoons, with the dominant taxa similar across all sites. Waders used all sites; albeit at lower abundance and richness on silt lagoons and two species were recorded breeding on active silting sites. We conclude that the fine, uniform sediments of modern silt lagoons limited invertebrate diversity and abundance, diminishing the value of silt lagoons to waders.
