5000|$|The C-MAG is {{a compact}} twin-drum {{magazine}} design that accepts up to 100 rounds of ammunition. It {{consists of two}} main components: the twin-drum storage housing and an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>feed</b> clip assembly. The storage housing is standard and fits any like-caliber weapon. The feed clip assembly serves as an adapter for the specific weapon.|$|E
5000|$|... 51-column <b>Interchangeable</b> Read <b>Feed</b> - {{this feature}} allowed the 2540 to read 51-column [...] "stub" [...] cards in {{addition}} to standard 80-column cards. Operator setup was required to change card size, so the two sizes could not be intermixed. Installation of this feature reduced the capacities of stackers R1 and R2 to around 800 cards, and reduced read speed to 800 CPM.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980s {{both the}} HK21A1 and HK11A1 were modernized, {{resulting}} in a new modular family of machine guns that share the same receiver, trigger group and <b>interchangeable</b> barrels and <b>feed</b> units, consisting of: ...|$|R

After some time, some of the camera feeds' names turn red, the lighting changes from blue to green, and trash bags and obscured parts of inanimate or writhing human bodies appear.|$|R

NICS is a FOSC-type cryogenic focal reducer, equipped with two <b>interchangeable</b> cameras <b>feeding</b> a Rockwell Hawaii 1024 x 1024 array. The camera used for the spectroscopic observations has a focal ratio of F/ 4. 3, corresponding to a plate scale = 0. 25 ”/pixel (Oliva & Gennari 1995; Baffa et al. 2000). Among the many imaging and spectroscopic observing modes, NICS offers a unique, high throughput, low resolution spectroscopic mode with an Amici prism disperser (Oliva 2001), which yields a complete 0. 9 - 2. 5 µm spectrum. A 1. 0 ” width slit corresponding to a spectral resolving power R≃ 50 and quasi-constant along the spectrum, has been used. The low resolution together with the high efficiency of the Amic...|$|R
5000|$|The KDA is license-built in Poland by Huta Stalowa Wola. It is a gas-operated weapon with a dual {{belt feed}} mechanism, {{driven by a}} laterally-mounted gas piston {{operating}} rod. The air-cooled, fluted barrel has a variable rifling twist and {{is equipped with a}} muzzle device that relays muzzle velocities to the fire control computer. The left and right cannons are not <b>interchangeable</b> since their <b>feed</b> systems require a different mounting configuration for each gun. The cannon fires the 35x228 mm round with several types of ammunition, including Ahead [...] "smart" [...] rounds (which have a programmable fuse and directional payload ejection capability, allowing engagement of missiles and other very small targets) and subcaliber FAPDS. The HE ammunition is stored in a magazine {{at the base of the}} turret basket and has a capacity for 2x210 rounds. Belts with armour-piercing ammunition (20 rounds per belt) are carried in large magazines on the turret exterior. The turret and gun drive systems are electrical.|$|R
