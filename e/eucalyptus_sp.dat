25|$|The {{planting}} of <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E

Endophytic microorganisms live inside healthy plants without causing any damage to their hosts and can be beneficial, acting as plant growth promoters. We isolated endophytic bacteria from eucalyptus plants and evaluated their potential in plant growth promotion of clonal plantlets of Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis, known as the hybrid, E. urograndis. Eighteen isolates of E. urograndis, clone 4622, were tested for plant growth promotion using the same clone. These isolates were also evaluated for indole acetic acid production and their potential for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization.

40|$|Field data, {{collected}} at fortnightly intervals {{over a period}} of three years, show a distinctly bimodal rhythm in the shoot growth of Eucalyptus species in the Brisbane area of Queensland. Maximum growth occurs in autumn and spring growth is reduced during summer and, apart from periods of warmer weather, virtually ceases during winter. The bimodal growth rhythm is due to the interacting influence of unimodal curves relating monthly values for dry matter production of the leaf canopy to the respective effects of mean daily temperature, intensity of solar radiation, and available water. When the mean monthly temperature falls below 16 - 18 °C, most photosynthates are translocated to stems and roots: little canopy growth then occurs, thus accentuating the winter depression in shoot growth. Shoot growth in the Brisbane region is compared with that observed in other areas of Australia.

These communities differ strongly in their soluble soil nitrogen (N) composition. The ability of the fungi to use inorganic (nitrate, ammonium) and organic (amide, peptide, protein) nitrogen sources was determined. As the fungi did not grow in liquid culture, a 2 ̆ 7 floating culture 2 ̆ 7 technique was devised that allows hyphal growth on a screen floating on liquid medium. With some exceptions, fungal biomass production in floating culture closely reflected fungal growth on solid media assessed by total colony glucosamine content. Most isolates grown in floating culture had similar glucosamine concentrations on all N sources, with isolate specific concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 mug glucosamine g(- 1) DW. However, Russula spp. had up to 1. 7 -fold higher glucosamine concentrations when growing with glutamine or ammonium compared to nitrate, glutathione or protein. Floating cultures supplied with 0. 5, 1. 5. 4. 5, or 10 mm N mostly produced greatest biomass with 4. 5 mM N. In vitro nitrate reductase activity (NRA) ranged from very low (0. 03 mumol NO 2 - g(- 1) fw h(- 1)) in Russula sp. (wallum) to high (2. 16 mumol NO 2 - g(- 1) fw h(- 1)) in Gymnoboletus sp.

40|$|Imazapyr has {{presented}} excellent results in controlling coppices in stand reforms of eucalypt forests, despite {{differences in the}} efficacy levels. To find out whether these different responses are caused by the genetic variability of the cultivated materials, two experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions with different imazapyr doses in a hydroponic system in plastic vases containing 2, 500 mL solution. The clones IEF- 1 (Eucalyptus grandis x <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> hybrid), GE 463 (E. urophylla x E. grandis), and MN 445 (E. grandis x <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> hybrid) {{were used in the}} first assay, and IEF- 1, IEF 2 (E. grandis x E. urophylla) x <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> hybrid) and the clones 129 and 7182 (E. grandis x <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> hybrids) in the second assay. Thirty days after transplanting the seedlings to a nutritive solution, imazapyr was applied to the solution at doses of 0. 00, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 40, 0. 80, 1. 60 and 3. 20 muL L- 1. Clone GE 463 proved to be more tolerant to imazapyr than clones IEF- 1 and MN 445 in the first assay; however, in the second, clone 7182 was the most tolerant. Thus, doses should also be differentiated when controlling coppices, according to the cultivated clone...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo objetivou determinar a suficiência amostral para coletas de serapilheira acumulada sobre o solo em povoamentos de Pinus elliottii, <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.,</b> ambos plantados no Campus da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria e em uma área de Floresta Estacional Decidual (FED) localizada no Morro do Elefante, Santa Maria, RS. Para a realização do estudo, foram coletadas 100 amostras de serapilheira por floresta, com o auxílio de uma moldura quadrada de 25 cm de lado, totalizando 300 amostras, as quais foram separadas nas seguintes frações: acículas ou folhas, galhos, estruturas reprodutivas, cascas e resíduos. Com base nos pesos de matéria seca de cada fração, realizou-se a análise estatística dos dados, visando à estabilização dos valores do coeficiente de variação (CV%). Para Pinus elliottii, a maior contribuição na formação da serapilheira foi dada pelas acículas, com 57, 2 %; em <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.,</b> isso ocorreu com os galhos (38, 8 %) e na FED, novamente com as folhas, que representaram 49, 6 % da serapilheira. No Pinus elliottii, o maior CV% se deu nos resíduos, seguido de estruturas reprodutivas. Em <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.,</b> o maior CV% foi encontrado em cascas, seguido de galhos. Na FED, as cascas tiveram o maior CV%. A suficiência amostral necessária para Pinus elliottii foi de 40, sendo esse o povoamento que necessitou de menos amostras para estabilizar o CV%. Em <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.,</b> a suficiência amostral foi de 70, enquanto na FED foram necessárias 80 amostras. This study {{determined}} the sample sufficiency {{for the collection}} of litter accumulated on the soil, in Pinus elliottii and <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> stands, planted in the Campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria and a Seasonal Deciduous Forest, located at the "Morro do Elefante", Santa Maria - RS. To carry out this study, 100 samples were collected per site, using a square frame (25 cm²), totaling 300 samples. The samples were separated in the following fractions: needles or leaves, branches, reproductive structures, barks and wastes. Based on the dry weights of each fraction, a statistical analysis was carried out, aiming the stabilization of the coefficient of variation (CV%). For Pinus elliotti, "needles" was the fraction that contributed the most, 57. 2 %; for the <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.,</b> the branches contributed with 38. 8 %; and for the Seasonal Deciduous Forest the leaves contributed with 46. 9 %. The highest CV% in Pinus elliottii was for the wastes, followed by the reproductive structures. In <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> the highest CV% was for barks, followed by branches. In the Seasonal Deciduous Forest, the barks had the highest CV%. The sample sufficiency for Pinus elliotti was 40, so this stand needed fewer samples to stabilize the CV%. For <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> the sample sufficiency was 70, and in the Seasonal Deciduous Forest 80 samples were needed...|$|E
40|$|Productive and {{reproductive}} traits of beehives {{are influenced by}} climate and food availability in the region where the bees are reared or maintained, thus honey and pollen storage, egg-laying conditions of the queen as well as comb occupation are subject to seasonal variations. The present {{study was conducted in}} the apiary of the Department of Entomology and Acarology, College of Agriculture Luiz de Queiroz, ESALQ/USP, in the municipality of Piracicaba, in an area containing fruit trees, ornamental plants and a fragment of a native forest. The objective was to identify protein sources used by honeybees (Apis mellifera) over a whole year (2010 - 2011) in remnants of the Atlantic forest, information {{that can be used in}} the conservation and restoration of degraded areas. For sample preparation, the acetolysis method was adopted (Eredtman 1952) and the quantitative analysis was performed by counting successive samples of 900 grains per sample which were grouped by botanical species and/or pollen types. The results show that the bees used various plant types in the area, including ruderal species, to maintain their colonies. Apis mellifera seeks food sources in all plants in the surroundings of the apiary, including herbaceous, shrubs, trees, native or introduced. <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> played an important role as a food source in all seasons due to its wide availability around the apiary and its high flower production. The most frequent pollen types (greater than 10 % of the sample) were Anadenanthera sp., Acacia sp, Miconia sp. and <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> in winter; Philodendron sp., Mikania cordifolia, Parthenium and <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> in spring; Alternanthera ficoidea, Chamissoa altissima and <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> in summer; Philodendron sp., Raphanus sp. and <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>sp.</b> in autumn.
