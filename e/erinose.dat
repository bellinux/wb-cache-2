5000|$|Petit Bouschet is a {{early to}} mid-ripening variety that also buds early {{which can make}} it prone to damage from early spring frost in some areas. The vine can be very {{vigorous}} and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and green harvesting. Petit Bouschet also {{has a tendency to}} produce numerous basal shoots that grow on the trunk of the grapevine below the cordons. Also known as [...] "suckers", these shoots can sap the vine of nutritional and water resources that would otherwise be funneled into developing and ripening the grape clusters and will need to be removed throughout the growing season. Other viticultural hazards that Petit Bouschet is susceptible to include infection from <b>erinose</b> mites.|$|E
40|$|Three {{biological}} {{races of}} <b>Erinose</b> (Eriophyes vitis Pgst. sin Colomerus vitis Pgst.) commonly attack vineyards every year. A genetic map Welschriesling x Sirius (Mandl et al. 2006) {{was used as}} the basis of QTL (quantitative trait loci) analysis for <b>Erinose.</b> The symptoms were evaluated in five consecutive years in 92 individuals from this segregating population and other OIV traits related to the density of hairs in different tissues were also scored. QTL analysis was performed on all data using Plabqtl version 1. 1. A major QTL for <b>Erinose</b> sensitivity was identified and reproducible every year on linkage group 9 d close to the SSR marker VMC 5 c 1. Two additional smaller QTLs could also be identified in linkage groups 5 and 17. The fact that some OIV traits related to the density of hairs were linked to the same group of the genetic map, is also discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Since {{the first}} report of Aceria litchi in Brazil, litchi {{productivity}} is reducing in the main productive regions. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate litchi varieties in relation to feeding by A. litchi mite and to determine the moisture and reducing sugars contents, seeking sources resistant to this mite. The experiment was conducted in the Fruit Growing Active Germoplasm Bank, Laboratory of Acarology and Laboratory of Soil Biochemistry at FCAV/UNESP. The plant varieties evaluated were Americana, Bengal, Groff, Mauritius and Sweet Clift varieties. Descriptions were performed regarding symptoms caused by A. litchii, moisture and reducing sugars contents present in the leaves of plantvarieties. There were differences among varieties with respect to the symptoms caused by A. litchi regarding <b>erinose</b> formation and coloring. The final <b>erinose</b> formed in &# 8216;Groff&# 8217;, &# 8216;Americana&# 8217; and &# 8216;Bengal&# 8217; varieties is similar in relation to color and density of erineos. The highest reducing sugars and moisture contents were observed in &# 8216;Bengal&# 8217;, while the lowest values were found in &# 8216;Mauritius&# 8217;. Visually in the field, &# 8216;Bengal&# 8217; was highly susceptible to A. litchii and &# 8216;Mauritius&# 8217; was the least damaged by <b>erinose.</b> &# 8216;Sweet Clift&# 8217; was as susceptible to A. litchi as Bengal variety. The results are pioneer in Brazil and provide subsidies for breeding programs on litchi trees resistant to A. licthii...|$|E
40|$|Forest health {{surveillance}} (FHS) of hardwood plantations commenced in Queensland in 1997 as plantations expanded following a state government planting initiative {{arising from the}} national 2020 forest policy vision. The estate was initially characterised by {{a large number of}} small plantations (10 - 50 ha), although this has changed more recently with the concentration of larger plantations in the central coast and South Burnett regions. Due to the disparate nature of the resource, drive- and walkthrough surveys of subsets of plantations have been undertaken in preference to aerial surveys. FHS has been effective in detecting a number of new hardwood pests in Queensland including <b>erinose</b> mites (Rhombacus and Acalox spp.), western white gum plate galler (Ophelimus sp.), Creiis psyllid and bronzing bug (Thaumastocoris sp.), in evaluating their potential impact and assisting in focussing future research efforts. Since 2003 there has been an increased emphasis on training operational staff to take a greater role in identifying and reporting on forest health issues. This has increased their awareness of forest health issues, but their limited time to specifically survey and report on pests and diseases, and high rates of staff turnover, necessitate frequent ongoing training. Consequently, common and widespread problems such as quambalaria shoot blight (Quambalaria pitereka), chrysomelid leaf beetles (mainly Paropsis atomaria) and <b>erinose</b> mites may be under-reported or not reported, and absence data may often not be recorded at all. Comment is made on the future directions that FHS may take in hardwood plantations in Queensland...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of forest}} health {{research}} is to develop cost-effective, environmentally sustainable management options for pests and pathogens that can cause considerable damage resulting in significant economic losses. Hardwood (eucalypt) plantations are attacked by insects moving from native forest into these large even-aged monocultures which provide a vast resource allowing rapid population buildup. Major pest guilds of eucalypts include sap suckers, defoliators and stem borers. Softwood (pine) plantations have fewer pest species, but the exotic pine woodwasp has recently established in Queensland and threatens productivity in subtropical areas. Our current forest health research includes resistance breeding, optimising site nutrition, landscape modelling for predicting risk factors, enhancing natural enemies for biological control in plantations, and exploiting chemical signalling pathways between pests and hosts. Key pests of hardwood plantations include <b>erinose</b> mites, leaf beetles and stem borers and specific research results on these groups will be discussed...|$|E
