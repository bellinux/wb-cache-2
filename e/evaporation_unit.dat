Lignin is the major non-cellulosic constituent of wood. It is a complex, amorphous highly crosslinked polyphenolic. Lignosulphonate in spent liquor in sulphite mills has long been isolated using ultra filtration. Generally, precipitation is used to extract the lignin from kraft black liquor. The liquor is commonly withdrawn from the <b>evaporation</b> <b>unit</b> in the recovery system, where the dry substance is optimal for precipitation. Lately, interest in the isolation of lignin by ultrafiltration of kraft black liquor has arisen. The concentration of the liquor is not that critical, and there is therefore considerable freedom {{in the choice of}} liquor for treatment with ultra filtration. In this work, the influence of membrane cut-off, transmembrane pressure and cross-flow velocity during ultrafiltration of cooking liquor and black liquor was studied. The extraction of lignin from hardwood black liquor withdrawn before the <b>evaporation</b> <b>unit</b> was investigated. A hybrid ultrafiltration/nanofiltration process was used. The lignin concentration was 60 g/l in the black liquor and 165 g/l in the product stream (the narrofiltration retentate). A cost estimate indicates a production cost of (sic) 33 per tonne of lignin.

40|$|Climate {{predictions}} {{are affected}} by high uncertainties partially due to an insufficient knowledge of aerosol–cloud interactions. One of the poorly understood processes is formation of mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) via heterogeneous ice nucleation. Field measurements of the atmospheric ice phase in MPCs are challenging due {{to the presence of}} much more numerous liquid droplets. The Ice Selective Inlet (ISI), presented in this paper, is a novel inlet designed to selectively sample pristine ice crystals in mixed-phase clouds and extract the ice residual particles contained within the crystals for physical and chemical characterization. Using a modular setup composed of a cyclone impactor, droplet <b>evaporation</b> <b>unit</b> and pumped counterflow virtual impactor (PCVI), the ISI segregates particles based on their inertia and phase, exclusively extracting small ice particles between 5 and 20 μm in diameter. The setup also includes optical particle spectrometers for analysis of the number size distribution and shape of the sampled hydrometeors. The novelty of the ISI is a droplet <b>evaporation</b> <b>unit,</b> which separates liquid droplets and ice crystals in the airborne state, thus avoiding physical impaction of the hydrometeors and limiting potential artefacts. The design and validation of the droplet <b>evaporation</b> <b>unit</b> is based on modelling studies of droplet evaporation rates and computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas and particle flows through the unit. Prior to deployment in the field, an inter-comparison of the optical particle size spectrometers and a characterization of the transmission efficiency of the PCVI was conducted in the laboratory. The ISI was subsequently deployed during the Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment (CLACE) 2013 and 2014 – two extensive international field campaigns encompassing comprehensive measurements of cloud microphysics, as well as bulk aerosol, ice residual and ice nuclei properties. The campaigns provided an important opportunity for a proof of concept of the inlet design. In this work we present the setup of the ISI, including the modelling and laboratory characterization of its components, as well as field measurements demonstrating the ISI performance and validating the working principle of the inlet. Finally, measurements of biological aerosol during a Saharan dust event (SDE) are presented, showing a first indication of enrichment of bio-material in sub- 2 μm ice residuals...|$|E

30|$|The main {{heating energy}} {{requirements}} {{in the base}} cases are those for the distillation- and evaporation stages, the preheating of the distillation- and evaporation feed and the dryer. The distillation units use between 28 % (the 2 G stand-alone plant) and 43 % (the 1 G stand-alone plant) of the total energy required by the base cases, without heat integration. Depending on the pressure in the distillation columns, {{and the size of}} the feed flow, the energy required to preheat the feed to the distillation stage will vary between 11 %, for the 1 G stand-alone plant, and 28 %, for the 2 G stand-alone plant. In the 1 G plant the feed is heated to a lower temperature than in the 2 G plant since the pressure in the columns is operated from low to high pressure so as to avoid gluten deposits, while the columns in the 2 G plant are operated from high to low pressure. The <b>evaporation</b> <b>units</b> consume between 11 and 19 % of the total energy usage for the various cases without heat integration, where the 1 G plant requires the lowest, and the combined plant and the 2 G stand-alone plant the highest, since the stillage is more diluted in these cases. Preheating the feed prior to evaporation in the non-heat integrated cases would require between 7 and 14 % of the total energy used by the different plants. The 2 G stand-alone plant and the combined plant requires a high energy input to preheat the evaporation feed, due to the expected low ethanol concentration in the distillation feed, resulting in a large stillage stream. Finally, the dryer utilized 10 - 17 % of the total energy requirement in the 1 G stand-alone and the co-located cases without heat integration.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 150 - 152) A Peltier Effect Diffusion Still (PEDS) is {{a multiple}} effect evaporator driven by solid state thermoelectric heat pumps {TEHPs}. TEHPs {{embedded in the}} walls between diffusion cells enhance the temperature gradient driving the separation process. To demonstrate feasibility, PEDS is applied to milk concentration. The classic lumped parameter TEHP equations are reformulated {{and the effect of}} thin film thermoelectrics included. Thin film, rather than modular TEHPs are imperative to control thermal contact resistance. The concept of a limiting pressure in each diffusion cell is introduced that resolves conflicting criteria between low diffusion resistance and evaporation without flashing. PEDS system performance is predicted with an algorithm that solves a multiply-nested, simultaneous heat and mass transfer problem, subject to the constraints imposed by thermoelectric heat pumping. For a broad range of operating conditions, the TEHP temperature rise approximately balances the chamber temperature drop, so small changes in external temperatures drive large changes in heat flux. For multiple cell separation processes, parallel and serial feed streams yield essentially the same result. Both system COP and thermoelectric heat transfer area are inversely proportional to heat flux. For a thermoelectric figure of merit of. 003 /K, a quarter inch diffusion cell gap, and a heat flux of 500 BTU/hr ft 2 (the expected upper limit for separation without splatteringj, predicted COP varies from 26 to 57 and the required area varies from 1. 6 to 3. 7 ft 2 /(lb/hr).
