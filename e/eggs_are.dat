5|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{taken by}} a number of mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs.

40|$|ACT: Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.) <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> sampled using a Tucker trawl and a MOCNESS-sampler at 3 {{selected}} localities in North Norway. The {{specific density}} of the <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> determined in a density-gradient column. The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> found to achieve higher specific density with increasing age. In areas with a horizontally stable, clearly defined pycnocline (Andfjord and Seraysund), the vertical distribution of <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> characterized by a unimodal egg distribution. Furthermore, the older <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> found at higher average capture salinities than younger eggs, i. e. they were distributed {{in relation to their}} neutral buoyancy. In an area with a horizontally more variable and less defined pycnocline (Malangen), the pattern of vertical distribution of <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> less distinct, often with polymodal egg distributions. In this hydrographically variable system, no heterogeneity in the distribution of the various egg developmental stages could be discerned. In Malangen, thus, it is proposed that the vertical distribution of halibut <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> most strongly influenced by physical factors...|$|R
5|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> almost {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> fine {{quality and}} often eaten as: omelettes, hard-boiled with mayonnaise, {{scrambled}} plain, scrambled haute cuisine preparation, œuf à la coque.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E

5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E

5|$|Many wasp {{species are}} parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or {{in a host}} {{arthropod}} on which the larvae then feed. Some larvae start off as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid directly into plant tissues and form galls, which protect the developing larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by the developing wasp larvae.|$|E
5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks. Insects are active when {{temperature}} reaches 20°C; temperatures above 25°C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15°C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the oviposition process. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E
5|$|Which {{of the two}} ovaries—left or right—ovulates appears {{essentially}} random; {{no known}} left and right co-ordination exists. Occasionally, both ovaries will release an egg; if both <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> fertilized, the result is fraternal twins.|$|E

50|$|Separating <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> a process, {{generally}} used in cooking, {{in which}} the <b>egg</b> yolk <b>is</b> removed from the egg white. This allows {{one part of the}} <b>egg</b> to <b>be</b> used without the other part, or each part to be treated in different ways. Recipes for custard call for egg yolks, for example. The most common reason for separating <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> so the whites can be whipped.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Clutch size {{depends on}} the {{location}} and the food source, but generally Aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs. The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a dull white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not all, species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls.|$|E
5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
