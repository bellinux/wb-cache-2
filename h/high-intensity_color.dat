My discussion revolves around three photographers: William Eggleston, Birney Imes, and William K. Greiner, who make striking color photographs in the U. S. South. I discuss the critical reception of their work and place it {{within the context of}} political and cultural attitudes toward the region and issues of race expressed in the media in the 1970 s-early 00 's. The important role played by Museum of Modern Art [MoMA] curator John Szarkowski was central in shaping discussions about contemporary photography during this period, placing Eggleston as the herald of the color photography explosion. I explore changing attitudes toward artistic and documentary color photography among photographers, critics, and the general public leading into the 1970 s, arguing that these attitudes influenced the reception of the often <b>high-intensity</b> <b>color</b> images of Eggleston, Imes, and Greiner, in the decades that followed. 	I discuss the critical reception of William Eggleston's 1976 photography exhibition at MoMA. I examine how Imes's color photographs of juke joints and roadhouses in Mississippi utilize the expressive potentials of color film to depict these liminal, public/private spaces as sites of boundary crossing in a racially divided culture. I explore the ways in which William K. Greiner uses color to depict the pre-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans metropolitan area. 	 My contribution is to show how Eggleston, Imes, and Greiner employed the expressive, visceral potentials of color photography to interpret and navigate the uncertain moral terrain of the U. S South in the era following the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. Dissertatio...|$|E
5000|$|Considered a {{major force}} in the Op Art movement, Anuszkiewicz is {{concerned}} with the optical changes that occur when different <b>high-intensity</b> <b>colors</b> are applied to the same geometric configurations. Most of his work comprises visual investigations of formal structural and color effects, many of them nested square forms similar to the work of his mentor Josef Albers. In his series, [...] "Homage to the Square," [...] Albers experimented with juxtapositions of color, and Anuszkiewicz developed these concepts further. Anuszkiewicz has continued to produce works in the Op Art style over the last few decades.|$|R
5000|$|The EGA uses {{a female}} nine-pin D-subminiature (DE-9) {{connector}} which looks {{identical to the}} CGA connector. The hardware signal interface, including the pin configuration, is largely compatible with CGA. The differences are in the re-purposing of three pins for the EGA's secondary RGB signals: the CGA [...] "Intensity" [...] pin (pin six) has been changed to [...] "Secondary Green (Intensity)"; the second ground of CGA (pin two) has been changed to [...] "Secondary Red (Intensity)", and pin seven (Reserved on the CGA) is now used for [...] "Secondary Blue (Intensity)". If the EGA is operated in modes having the same scan rates as CGA, a connected CGA monitor should operate correctly, though if the monitor connects pin two to ground, the shorting of the EGA's secondary red output to ground could conceivably damage the EGA adapter. Similarly, if the CGA monitor is wired with pin two as its sole ground (which is poor design), it will not work with the EGA, though it will work with a CGA. Finally, because {{of the use of}} the CGA's intensity pin as secondary green, on a CGA monitor connected to an EGA, all CGA colors will display correctly, but all other EGA colors will incorrectly display as the standard CGA color which has the same values for the g, R, G, and B bits (ignoring the r and b bits.) Conversely, an EGA monitor should work with a CGA adapter, but the secondary red signal will be grounded (always zero) and the secondary blue will be floating (unconnected), causing all <b>high-intensity</b> CGA <b>colors</b> except brown to display incorrectly, and all colors to potentially have a variable blue tint due to the indeterminate state of the unconnected secondary blue.|$|R
