25|$|That <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{assume that}} NP, {{the class of}} nondeterministic {{polynomial}} time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class P/poly, then this assumption implies {{the collapse of the}} polynomial hierarchy at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P ≠ NP. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp–Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.|$|E
25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E

500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2017, Buffon {{announced}} that the 2017–18 season would likely be his last with the club. Regarding the likelihood of his retirement {{at the end of}} the season, he commented: [...] "I'm 99.9 percent certain of that. I'm going to have one final, intense season, rich in big moments, and then it will be time to say enough is enough. We've just left one small possibility open with the [...] president , and that <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> manage to win the Champions League I will carry on playing one more year to try to win the Club World Cup and other trophies.". On 4 August, Buffon was named one of the three finalists for the Goalkeeper of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League season award, along with Manuel Neuer and Jan Oblak. On 15 August, Buffon was also listed as one of the three finalists for the 2017 UEFA Best Player of the Year Award, along with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. On 19 August, Buffon made history by saving the first Serie A penalty awarded via VAR in a 3–0 home win over Cagliari in the club's opening league match of the season. On 24 August, he was named the best goalkeeper of the 2016–17 Champions League season, and placed third in the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, with 109 votes. On 23 October, Buffon won the inaugural 2017 Best FIFA Goalkeeper award, and was named to the FIFPro World XI for the third time in his career; he was also nominated for the 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player Award, finishing in fourth place in the voting.|$|E
500|$|Hawley's {{first thought}} when [...] "looking at the genre <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> remove the genre, {{is there a}} {{compelling}} show {{you want to watch}} there?" [...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was in part due to Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience should have the same experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland quality to it, of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal voice-over, to give the sense that we are not rooted in a physical time and place." [...] The intent was to put audiences [...] "in the state of mind to watch Legion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{dependence}} between variables X and Y {{does not depend}} on the scale on which the variables are expressed.

[...] This is true of some correlation statistics as well as their population analogues. Some correlation statistics, such as the rank correlation coefficient, are also invariant to monotone transformations of the marginal distributions of X and/or Y.|$|E

2500|$|As Nokia was {{the largest}} mobile phone and {{smartphone}} manufacturer worldwide at the time, it was suggested the alliance would help Windows Phone, but {{from the beginning of}} 2011, until 2013, Nokia fell from #1 to #10 in smartphone sales. In June 2011, Nokia was overtaken by Apple as the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. In Q2 2011, amid falling sales, Nokia posted a loss of €368 million, after having realized a profit of €227 million in Q2 2010. In September 2011, Nokia announced it would cut another 3,500 jobs worldwide, including the closure of its Cluj factory in Romania, after having cut as many as 7,000 the previous April. In August 2011 Chris Weber, head of Nokia's subsidiary in the U.S., stated that [...] "The reality <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are not successful with Windows Phone, it doesn't matter what we do [...] He further added, North America is a priority for Nokia [...] because it is a key market for Microsoft.

[...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
