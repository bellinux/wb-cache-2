Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain <b>good</b> <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> the Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position {{in the eyes of}} its allies and neighbors.|$|E

During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
