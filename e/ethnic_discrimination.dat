5|$|Because of {{religious}} and <b>ethnic</b> <b>discrimination,</b> Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{last years}} were productive. By May 1937, he was {{appointed}} {{as director of the}} Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high-level official to seriously fight <b>ethnic</b> <b>discrimination</b> in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of public facilities was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support The Wilderness Society, as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{qualitative}} research made on a public university in La Paz, Bolivia. The aim was to examine the beliefs and perceptions of the employees regarding the <b>ethnic</b> anti <b>discrimination</b> work at the university. As the Bolivian anti discrimination law and the constitution of 2009 has been made to improve the rights for the indigenous groups in Bolivia,we also wanted to hear if the laws have been implemented in their daily work. Seven interviews were done {{with the help of an}} interpreter, and a mix of goal oriented and snowball selection was used. Through the interviews, we found out that the <b>ethnic</b> anti <b>discrimination</b> work at the university is almost non-existing. It also showed that not much has been done to follow the law and the reforms of the constitution. This can be seen as nonperformative. Even though there are regulations about discrimination, the university is not actively working on the implementation of them. The opinion if an anti discrimination work was needed varied among the employees, as some respondents said that discrimination did not even exist at their faculty. To improve the <b>ethnic</b> anti <b>discrimination</b> work many of the respondents pointed on the need of a change in the culture. One important discussion has been about the lack of communication, information and education. These facts together with the change of culture can be seen as the most important factors to make progressions within the <b>ethnic</b> anti <b>discrimination</b> work at the university...|$|R

5|$|The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) ruled {{before the}} {{establishment}} of the Ming dynasty.

Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles, and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River. A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the Red Turbans in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the White Lotus, a Buddhist secret society. Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander. In 1356, Zhu's rebel force captured the city of Nanjing, which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty.|$|E

40|$|The contradictions between {{unity and}} disunity are {{interesting}} characteristics in American history. A famous {{clause in the}} Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal”, is a typical unifying factor of American society. However, {{in spite of this}} universal declaration of human rights, minorities have suffered from racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>discriminations</b> throughout American history. For example, not only non-whites were excluded from civil rights, but Catholic immigrants were also discriminated in the North. At the beginning those minorities resisted those discriminations while proclaiming the unifying logic: “all men are created equal”. In the early 20 th century, however, the non-WASP white population such as the Irish, Jews and Italians began to bring up the famous logic of “Melting Pot” or “Cultural Pluralism” to combat <b>ethnic</b> <b>discriminations.</b> Because of these resistances, John F. Kennedy could be elected to the first Catholic President in 1960. The non-white population, on the other hand, organized the Civil Rights Movements in the mid- 1950 s and succeeded in the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which abolished the Jim Crow system in the South. This victory gave them legal rights as citizens, but they were still discriminated economically as well as socially. Black people therefore organized the “Black Nationalism Movement”, which aimed at nursing their racial pride and called for social reforms such as affirmative action, whereas non-whites began to support “Multiculturalism” as a new logic for American integration. These historical processes in the racial and ethnic relations show us flexibility and elasticity in the formation of American Identity. In other words, minorities have been successful in changing the majority’s logic of integration {{as a result of their}} racial and ethnic struggles. These historical processes, I think, give many insights to the Japanese...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) Directive against {{racial and}} <b>ethnic</b> origin <b>discrimination</b> {{has been criticized}} for a number of rcasons.

40|$|<b>Ethnic</b> {{and gender}} <b>discrimination</b> {{in a variety}} of housing markets is {{documented}} in several populations. We conducted an online field experiment to examine <b>ethnic</b> and gender <b>discrimination</b> in the private rental housing market in Finland. We sent 1459 inquiries regarding 800 apartments. We compared responses to standardized apartment inquiries including fictive Arabic-sounding, Finnish-sounding or Swedish-sounding female or male names. We found evidence of discrimination against Arabic-sounding names and against male names. Inquiries including Arabic-sounding male names had the lowest probability of receiving a response, receiving a response to about 16 % of the inquiries made, while Finnish-sounding female names received a response to 42 % of the inquiries. We did not find any evidence of landlords’ gender moderating the observed discrimination pattern.

40|$|Objective: This study tested {{whether an}} {{immigrant}} mother’s perception of <b>ethnic</b> and language-based <b>discrimination</b> affects {{the health of}} her child (indexed by the child’s frequency of sick visits to the doctor, adjusting for well-visits), {{as a function of}} her ethnic-group attachment and length of U. S. residency. Method: A community-based sample of 98 immigrant Dominican and Mexican mothers of normally developing 14 -month-old children were interviewed. Mothers reported their perceived <b>ethnic</b> and language-based <b>discrimination,</b> degree of ethnic-group attachment, length of time in the United States, and frequency of their child’s doctor visits for both illness and routine (healthy) exams. Results: Among more recent immigrants, greater perceived <b>ethnic</b> and language-based <b>discrimination</b> were associated with more frequent sick-child visits, but only among those reporting low ethnic-group attachment. The associations between both forms of perceived discrimination and sick-child visits were not observed among mothers reporting high ethnic-group attachment. Among more established immigrants, perceived language-based discrimination was associated with more frequent sick-child visits regardless of ethnic-group attachment. Conclusion: These results suggest that a Latina mother’s experience with <b>ethnic</b> and language-based <b>discrimination</b> is associated with her child’s health, as indicated by doctor visits for illness, but that strong ethnic-group attachment may mitigate this association among recent immigrants...|$|R

25|$|Racial {{categories}} in Latin America are often linked to both continental ancestry or mixture as inferred from phenotypical traits, {{but also to}} socio-economic status.

25|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is another}} environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within {{the real estate}} industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>discrimination</b> adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination {{have been shown to}} have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.|$|E

Some elements of the curriculum, such as the Wu Feng Legend, are currently considered offensive to aborigines. Much {{of the burden of}} educating the aborigines was undertaken by unqualified teachers, who could, at best, speak Mandarin and teach basic ideology.
