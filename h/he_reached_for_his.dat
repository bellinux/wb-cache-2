The {{foreshortened}} elbow of the Child as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo.|$|R

60|$|Cicely {{smiled back}} at him. Her face was scarlet, for the {{coupling}} of their names, and Drexley's quiet smile, was significant.
