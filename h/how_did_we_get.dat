2500|$|Pink {{has stated}} that this album is her most {{vulnerable}} to date. Much of the album's subject matter alludes {{to the fact that}} Moore had recently separated from her husband, Carey Hart. The first single, [...] "So What", opens with: [...] "I guess I just lost my husband/I don't know where he went". [...] "Please Don't Leave Me" [...] also addresses the split. The artist sums up its theme thus: [...] "Okay, I’m an asshole, but love me anyway." [...] In [...] "Mean", she sings, [...] "It was good in the beginning/but <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> so mean?" ...|$|E

60|$|Where and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> {{the idea}} that the Germans are a stolid, phlegmatic race? In truth, they are widely removed from that. They are warm-hearted, emotional, impulsive, enthusiastic, their tears come at the mildest touch, and {{it is not hard to}} move them to laughter. They are the very {{children}} of impulse. We are cold and self-contained, compared to the Germans. They hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing; and where we use one loving, petting expression, they pour out a score. Their language is full of endearing diminutives; nothing that they love escapes the application of a petting diminutive--neither the house, nor the dog, nor the horse, nor the grandmother, nor any other creature, animate or inanimate.|$|E

We don't want to go there with this cargo; I don't know as old bottles is a lively article anywheres; leastways, I'll go my bottom cent, it ain't Peru. It was always a doubt if we could sell the schooner; I never rightly hoped to, and now I'm sure she ain't worth a hill of beans; what's wrong with her I don't know; I only know it's something, or she wouldn't be here with this truck in her inside. Then again, if we lose her, and land in Peru, where are we? We can't declare the loss, or <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to Peru? In that case the {{merchant}} can't touch the insurance; most likely he'll go bust; and don't you think you see the three of us on the beach of Callao?" ...|$|E

It is such a short time since I was living the ordinary sort of mechanical life in London, engaged to be married to you, and my doings day by day all mapped out--a life interesting, of course, but without any real variation. And now here I am, hanging on to life by the thin edge of nothing, writing such things as I should never have dared to have said from my seat in the House, practically an adventurer. Do you wonder that sometimes I am not quite sure that it isn't all a nightmare? I am actually hiding here in Paris from assassins--in Paris, the most civilized city in the world--the guest of a woman whose acquaintance I made only because a little manicurist in Soho insisted upon it. And you, Anne, are here by my side, a professional secretary, the friend of a milliner, more intimate and on better terms with me than you were in the days when we were engaged to be married!

40|$|Abstract: By copying {{information}} from sources and distributing it to new destinations <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not lose {{information at the}} sources. Nevertheless, exchange of information is still restricted by patent law, {{as well as by}} institutional, cultural and traditional hurdles that create protective barriers hindering the free flow of this valuable commodity. We believe that one of the greatest challenges we face in creating a new research paradigm will be building the community modeling and information sharing culture. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> engineers and scientists to put aside their traditional modes of <b>doing</b> business? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> provide the incentives that will be required to make these changes happen? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> our colleagues to see that the benefits of sharing resources far outweigh the costs?
