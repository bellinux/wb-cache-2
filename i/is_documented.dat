5|$|Not {{only were}} stone castles {{expensive}} {{to build in}} the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, which was often unseasoned {{and as a result}} needed careful upkeep. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> that in the late 12thcentury repairs at castles such as Exeter and Gloucester cost between £20 and £50 annually.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vijithapura was {{a decisive}} and major {{battle in the}} {{campaign}} carried out by Sri Lankan king Dutthagamani against the invading South Indian king Elara. The battle <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> in detail in the ancient chronicles of the country. However, they only provide the viewpoint of Dutthagamani and his army, and details are scarce on Elara's side.|$|E

50|$|A related fallacy is, of course, that {{whatever}} has not <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> {{must not have}} happened. Although absence of evidence is evidence of absence, whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it <b>was</b> <b>documented.</b>|$|R
5|$|The first {{document}} {{mentioning the}} existence of this community is the town charter granted by Mathieu d'Alsace in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders, Count of Boulogne; Calais thus became part of the county of Boulogne. In 1189, Richard the Lionheart <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> to have landed at Calais on his journey to the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|A clock <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} {{bell was}} installed. The city {{accounts}} of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|According to the ethnobiologists Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof, a {{medicinal}} plant is {{a plant that}} is used to attempt to maintain health, to be administered for a specific condition, or both, whether in modern medicine or in traditional medicine. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more conservatively estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind <b>is</b> <b>documented.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aldermaston {{may have}} been {{inhabited}} as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains of cereal grains {{have been found in}} the area. Written history of the village is traced back {{at least as far as}} the 9th century CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles show that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> in the Domesday survey. The village church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building's structure.|$|E
5|$|Celtiberian <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> as {{a written}} {{language}} only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (tesserae hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E
5|$|Deckham's other {{church is}} the Emmanuel Pentecostal Church, a plain, stone {{building}} {{located in a}} prominent position {{on the corner of}} Caris Street and Old Durham Road. Little <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> regarding this church, and the date of building is difficult to ascertain, though the Pentecostal movement in Britain dates to 1907 and the church was certified for the solomnising of marriages as recently as 21 October 1959. The Church {{is a member of the}} Assembly of God denomination of Pentecostalism and hold weekly Sunday worship, a prayer service on Mondays and a children's group on Wednesdays.|$|E

50|$|Eyewall mesovortices often exhibit unusual {{behavior}} in tropical cyclones. They usually rotate around the low pressure center, {{but sometimes they}} remain stationary.

These phenomena have <b>been</b> <b>documented</b> observationally, experimentally, and theoretically.|$|R
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had to buy back their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I <b>is</b> <b>documented</b> to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, {{but it was not}} until the reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust <b>is</b> <b>documented,</b> because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
