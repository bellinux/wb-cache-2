60|$|Thus much I {{could not}} refrain from saying, not that I think John Bull is very often {{right in his}} controversies with ourselves, but because <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> he is; and because I believe it far safer, in the long run, for a nation, or an individual, to have justice on his side, than always to carry his point.|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> Mrs Lawford intends to suggest not so much that--that her husband is in that condition; {{habitual}} sin, you know--grave enough, of course, I own--but that he is actually being compelled, even {{to the extent of}} a more or less complete change of physiognomy, to follow the biddings of some atrocious spiritual influence. It is no breach of confidence to say that I have myself been present at a death-bed where the struggle against what I may call the end was perfectly awful to witness. I don't profess to follow all the ramifications of the affair, but though possibly Mr Danton may seem a little harsh, such harshness, if I may venture to intercede, is not necessarily [...] "vindictive." [...] And--and personal security is a consideration.' ...|$|E

Now, at last, I see {{my way to}} useful {{summary of}} the whole, which I had better give in a {{separate}} chapter: and will try in future to do the preliminary work of elaboration of the sap from my authorities, above shown, in its process, to the reader, without making so much fuss about it. But, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> it was desirable that the floods of pros-, par-, peri-, dia-, and circumlocution, through which one has to wade towards any emergent crag of fact in modern scientific books, should for once {{be seen in the}} wasteful tide of them; that so I might finally pray the younger students who feel, or remember, their disastrous sway, to cure themselves for ever of the fatal habit of imagining that they know more of anything after naming it unintelligibly, and thinking about it impudently, than they did by loving sight of its nameless being, and in wise confession of its boundless mystery.|$|E

5000|$|Rob Cowan of Gramophone {{called it}} an [...] "imposing song-cycle" [...] and observed, [...] "Writing it must have proved a {{challenging}} and in some respects unenviable task, given the need to balance the inevitable emotional imperative {{with a sense of}} distance necessary if durable art {{is going to be the}} outcome, which <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> it is." [...] He added: The trans-national texts used are by Czesław Miłosz, Homer, Li Po and EY Harburg, and the orchestral style ranges from sublime simplicity to the harrowing sounds of battle (in the Patroclus excerpt from Homer's Iliad) where post-Bergian resonances underline vivid parallels (and I mean this in the best sense) between Corigliano and the finest American film composers, for example Leonard Rosenman. Mezzo Stephanie Blythe’s performance of the premiere is strong and sonorous, while Alan Gilbert conducts a compelling account of Corigliano's multifaceted score.|$|E
30|$|We {{feel that}} it is {{difficult}} to teach the Exchange phase. It is not easy to promote argumentation among students <b>in</b> <b>this</b> phase.

60|$|An {{intelligent}} foreigner's {{testimony about}} our manners is always worth having, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect {{the work of}} an eminent American, Mr. N. P.

He is always the lion of society.|$|R
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an an instructor interview in a Writing Intensive course in Communicology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014 and in this clip the interviewee is reflecting {{on the effects of}} bringing personal experience and culture into teaching theory. Brief excerpt from interview: In the major theory courses we don't cover cultural stuff, we cover more interpersonal [...] . more media, and a few organizational kinds of theories [...] . <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> just having a course that lets us go in depth more on a lot of those kinds of ideas [...] . {{we are going to talk}} about individualism and collectivism as dimensions of culture. We already spent time talking about this notion of similarity and difference between, but also within, cultures. How do we understand variance within a culture? We're slotted to spend much more time on things like self construal. How do you understand yourself in relation to other people? That's one of the components of the first writing assignment [...] . having them talk about, in that cultural autobiography [...] . How do you see your self-construal? Do you see it as more independent. Do you see it as more interdependent? And how do you link that to culture? By about week three of first semester, I stopped expecting to find anything [...] . and I just started seeing what happened, because it was clear that expecting anything wasn't getting me anywhere...|$|E

[...] "Although not very friendly, they would nevertheless help us, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hour of need. They have been demoralised by traders, and drawn away from the mission at Godhaab. But how we are to get to the mainland it is difficult to see, unless God mercifully clears away the ice." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the midst}} of my eighteenth year fortune began to darken. My mother had told me little of the world, its chances and changes, cares and troubles. What I had learned of these came chiefly from books and my own speculations. We had few {{visitors}} and from {{all but the most}} familiar I was quickly packed away. My mother was sensitive of me, for both our sakes. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> she was mistaken, for when my time came, Life found me raw, and it rubbed in the salt rather vigorously.|$|R

Watson told Katrina Fox [...] "I've never {{made a point of}} letting people know about my sexuality because I've never thought it was relevant, but it's who I am and I'm not ashamed of it. However <b>in</b> saying that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> particular day it's a lot easier to be identified as a not-so-straight woman particularly with the The L Word series out where it's glamorised if you like; it's almost a bit of a fad like we're in fashion." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> Muslims <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country {{need to take}} a long, {{hard look}} at {{themselves}} and decide what is their identity. Are they British or are they Muslim? I am a Muslim. Where I live, is irrelevant.|$|R

"I {{wanted to}} do really a very {{feminine}} and glamorous collection and young at the same time… The rust and the red mixed with the brown and the black… Colors are fashion and they are universal; {{they have to go}} everywhere. Color is the fun side of fashion. You have to mix the colors in fun way to make them look newer… We have seen very somber collections {{for a long time and}} it needs a little bit of color. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> women are ready to wear color… Romance is important and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> collection, there was a game of seduction you could play and not showing so much skin," [...] said Carolina Herrera backstage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder at}} that," [...] said he, with a smile, [...] "but I will explain. In {{theatrical}} circles each principal performer is furnished {{with what is}} termed in the profession an under-study. This is an actor, male or female, {{as the case may}} be, who studies the part of the performer, and is capable of going through with it, with more or less ability, in case the regular actor, from sickness or any other cause, is prevented from appearing in his part. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way the manager provides against emergencies which might at any time stop his play and ruin his business.

I'm going to state just what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign, and you can vote for me or not. It is sheer robbery to continue a tariff that was laid {{at a time when we}} needed enormous revenue. See the surplus piling up in the public vault. You say it's better to have a surplus than a deficit. Yes, but I'd rather have the surplus in the pockets of the people. This taxing the people to death, in order to have a surplus to expend in senseless appropriations, is poor policy." ...|$|R

60|$|In a glass case, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> room, was {{exhibited}} the suit of clothes he last wore; a blue coat with large metal buttons, plaid trousers, and broad-brimmed hat. Around {{the sides of}} this room there was a gallery of light tracery work; {{a flight of stairs}} led up to it, and in one corner of it was a door which the woman said led to the poet's bed room. One seemed to see <b>in</b> all <b>this</b> arrangement how snug, and cozy, and comfortable the poet had thus ensconced himself, to give himself up to his beloved labors and his poetic dreams. But there was a cold and desolate air of order and adjustment about it which reminds one of the precise and chilling arrangements of a room from which has just been carried out a corpse; all is silent and deserted.|$|R
5000|$|Freud and Bacon {{appeared}} {{as two of}} the Eight Portraits, an unpublished manuscript of photos and writings which was discovered after Deakin's death. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> work, Deakin wrote of Bacon: [...] "He's an odd one, wonderfully tender and generous by nature, yet with curious streaks of cruelty, especially to friends. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> portrait <b>I</b> managed to catch something of the fear which must underlie these contradictions in his character." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yves Winkin, a Belgian {{professor}} of communications, {{responded to a}} popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper Le Soir that [...] "There is no transcendent truth. ...

30|$|I {{would like}} to {{conclude}} calming the spirit of multiculturalists. They {{have no reason to}} be offended. I have argued that MC has many reasons to move from an initial idealist period to a much more pragmatic one, limiting its claim for inclusion under the auspices of equal justice. This MC pragmatic period (post-MC period) also means that the MC policy paradigm must abandon its hegemonic attitude and learn to share diversity-friendly narratives with other emerging distinctive policy paradigms: IC. <b>In</b> fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> MC legitimacy crisis I have drawn, IC can play the role of giving MC new breath.|$|R
