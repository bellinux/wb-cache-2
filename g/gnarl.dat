6000|$|Yes, {{there we}} sat: she cooed content, And bats ringed round, and {{daylight}} went; The <b>gnarl,</b> our seat, is wrenched and sunk, Prone that queer pocket {{in the trunk}} [...] Where lay the key [...] To her pale mystery.|$|E

My caress provoked a long, guttural <b>gnarl.</b>|$|E

Thereafter, Karuhl takes the name <b>Gnarled</b> Winslow. He's a member of Starrior and Texas Tom's team during the fight against Star Grass and the Star Bears at PP5 Headquarters. Later, after he kills Super Sullivan, <b>Gnarled</b> is hired by NASA as a new team member. They give him robot arms.|$|R

60|$|Aug. 4, 6 P.M.--Lights and {{shades and}} rare effects on tree-foliage and grass--transparent greens, grays, &c., all in sunset pomp and dazzle. The clear beams are now thrown in many new places, on the quilted, seam'd, bronze-drab, lower tree-trunks, shadow'd except at this hour--now {{flooding}} their {{young and old}} columnar ruggedness with strong light, unfolding to my sense new amazing features of silent, shaggy charm, the solid bark, the expression of harmless impassiveness, with many a bulge and <b>gnarl</b> unreck'd before. In the revealings of such light, such exceptional hour, such mood, one does not wonder at the old story fables, (indeed, why fables?) of people falling into love-sickness with trees, seiz'd extatic with the mystic realism of the resistless silent strength in them--strength, which after all is perhaps the last, completest, highest beauty.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gnarl</b> - <b>Gnarl</b> is a {{champion}} of Kragnan Empire that enslaved, ate and conquered half of the known universe. He loathes all other racers and any non-Kragnans for that matter. He'll gladly cheat, destroy or attempt to eat anything that stands in his way to achieve his empire's goals. As one would expect from a warrior, <b>Gnarl</b> loves to fight, knows not the meaning of compromise, and shows no mercy to anyone. <b>Gnarl</b> rides in [...] "Stone Klaw" [...] - an extremely heavy and strongly armed vehicle that well fits Gnarl's ruthless, combat-oriented driving style. However where proving its prowess in combat, its speed leaves much to be desired, and is often outraced by faster cars.|$|E
50|$|Buffy and Xander carry a {{completely}} paralyzed Dawn {{into the living}} room while Buffy researches <b>Gnarl</b> and the way to save Dawn. Anya is called to stay with Dawn while they prepare to return to the cave to kill the demon and save Dawn. Anya talks about seeing Willow and reveals that Willow may be at the cave, whilst she moves a paralysed Dawn into funny poses. Panicked that Willow is trapped in the cave, Buffy grabs Anya to join them at the cave. Once Anya reveals that she knows about <b>Gnarl,</b> Buffy insists she come along. <b>Gnarl</b> continues to eat Willow's skin as he tells her that her friends have abandoned her and she's all alone for him to eat. Buffy arrives and attacks <b>Gnarl</b> while Anya tends to a badly injured Willow who still can't see her friends. While Buffy fights <b>Gnarl,</b> Anya informs Willow that her friends didn't leave her alone.|$|E

50|$|Realizing {{they need}} {{to search for a}} trail of blood, Buffy decides to recruit Spike to smell the way. He leads them to a cave where the demon can be found. Willow is already there {{investigating}} the cave and <b>Gnarl</b> spots her. The rest of the gang enters the cave as well, but they don't see Willow. The demon scratches Dawn's stomach and paralyzes her. Buffy and Xander take Dawn out of the cave and cover up the entrance, unintentionally trapping Willow with <b>Gnarl.</b> Stuck in the cave, Willow listens to the demon taunt her from the shadows. He slices her abdomen with a nail and, thus paralyzed, Willow is helpless against him as he sucks at the wound and starts to slice away slivers of her skin to eat.|$|E

However, the Overlord witnesses the Abyss' forces falling to their knees, as defeating their original master has made the Overlord the new God of the Abyss. Back in the normal world, <b>Gnarl</b> and the minions mourn their loss, and <b>Gnarl</b> admits that he had a soft spot for this particular Overlord and considers the possibility that he might return, ending the scene with the same quote with which he ended the previous game: [...] "Evil will always find a way", at this point revealing that the Overlord’s mistress (either Rose or Velvet, though canonically Rose) is pregnant.|$|E
