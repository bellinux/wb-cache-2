5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monkey River is {{a coastal}} {{watercourse}} in southern Belize that {{rises in the}} Maya Mountains and discharges to the Caribbean Sea near Monkey River Town. One of Belize's major rivers, Monkey River has northern headwaters which originate in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the Swasey Branch drains the East Basin of that wildlife sanctuary. Further south, the Bladen Branch watercourse drains the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains including the ancient Mayan settlement areas of Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. These two watercourses join to form the Monkey River approximately 16 kilometres upstream {{from the mouth of}} the Monkey River. The Monkey River is readily navigated throughout the year using small boats, but navigation above the major confluence (of Bladen and Swasey Branches) becomes more difficult due to lack of depth when the dry season starts about February. Habitats in this watershed provide cover for such diverse species as the ocelot, jaguar, <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler,</b> bare-throated tiger heron, Morelet's crocodile, fer-de-lance and manatee.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} mantled howler {{along the edges}} of its range in Mexico and Guatemala near the Yucatan Peninsula. [...] One theory for how this sympatry occurred and why the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> has such a restricted range is the ancestors of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> and the Central American squirrel monkey migrated to Central America from South America during the late Miocene or Pliocene. However, passage through the Isthmus of Panama then closed for a period due to rising sea levels, and later opened up to another wave of migration about two million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the restricted range of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> (and the Central American squirrel monkey).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler's</b> diet {{includes}} mostly {{leaves and}} fruit. Flowers also {{make up a}} small part of the diet. The breadnut tree can provide as much as 86% of the monkey's diet during some seasons.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} howler monkey species, the {{majority}} of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler's</b> day is spent resting. Eating makes up {{about a quarter of the}} day, moving about 10% of the day, and the remainder of the day is spent in socializing and other activities.|$|R
50|$|The {{biosphere}} {{is home to}} 86 {{species of}} mammals, 18 {{of which can be}} found in the Official Registry of Mexican Ecology, a resource that outlines flora and fauna that are in danger of extinction, rare, threatened or are under protection. The area is home to 5 of the 6 large cats that are native to Mexico. This includes its small but healthy population of jaguars as well as jaguarundis, ocelots, pumas and margays. The fauna also includes Central American agoutis, Geoffroy's spider monkeys, <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howlers,</b> Baird's tapir, white-nosed coatis, ocellated turkeys, crested guans, toucans, and green parrots.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> is {{the largest}} of the howler monkey species and one of {{the largest of the}} New World monkeys. <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> males are larger than those of any other Central American monkey species. On average, males weigh 11.4 kg and females weigh 6.4 kg. [...] The body is between 521 and 639 mm in length, {{excluding}} the tail. [...] The tail is between 590 and 690 mm long. Adults of both sexes have long, black hair and a prehensile tail, while infants have brown fur. [...] Males over four months old have white scrotums.|$|E

40|$|The Community Baboon Sanctuary (CBS) in Belize is a {{community}} reserve for the endangered <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkey (Alouatta pigra). This study assessed {{the performance of the}} CBS as an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category IV protected area through deforestation and forest fragmentation of the CBS and 500 m river buffer, and impacts on <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkey habitat over 15 years (1989 - 2004). Using satellite imagery remote sensing and landscape metrics, this study helps fill the gap in our understanding of forest fragmentation processes and habitat provision, using the <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkey as a specific example. Increased fragmentation resulted in decreased forest cover by 33 % within both the CBS and river buffer. However, connectivity between habitat patches has remained high, indicating that dispersal and colonising potential between most forest patches has not been jeopardised. We conclude that conservation within the CBS may be more complex than simply equating forest conservation with <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkey conservation. One could say the CBS has been successful at <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkey conservation, as documented by population increases over the past 20 years. However, if the conservation objective is forest preservation, one could conclude conservation failure and may signal that the CBS should not be managed for a single outcome as assigned by an IUCN Category IV designation...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler,</b> or Yucatan black howler, (Alouatta pigra) is {{a species}} of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, from Central America. It is found in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, in and near the Yucatan Peninsula. It lives in evergreen, semideciduous and lowland rain forests. [...] It {{is also known as}} the baboon in Belize, {{although}} it is not closely related to the baboons in Africa.|$|E
50|$|Its {{most common}} species include macaw, parrot, and tapirs. The harpy eagle also calls this {{national}} park home. It is {{noted for its}} incredible genetic value.

5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> is diurnal and arboreal. It {{lives in}} groups of {{generally}} one or two adult males, with a ratio of about 1.3 females for every male. Groups generally have between two and 10 members, including juveniles, but groups as large as 16 members have been studied. [...] The home range is between 3 and 25 hectares. [...] Population density can exceed 250 monkeys per square kilometer in the Community Baboon Sanctuary in Belize.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> shares several adaptations {{with other}} species of howler monkey that allow it to pursue a folivorous diet (mostly leaves). Its molars have high {{shearing}} crests, to help it eat the leaves, and the male of the species has an enlarged hyoid bone near the vocal cords. [...] This hyoid bone amplifies the male howler's calls, allowing it to locate other males without expending much energy, which is important, since leaves are a low-energy food. Howling occurs primarily at dawn and at dusk.|$|E
5000|$|The {{park and}} {{adjacent}} buffer zone (known as [...] "Eco-región Lachuá") is {{noted for its}} high biodiversity. With 120 species of mammals (50% of mammal species found in Guatemala), 30-40 species of reptiles, 177 bird species (40% of bird species in Guatemala), and 36 fish species it is a sanctuary for a varied fauna population. These include fish like the diadromous tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), an ample variety of biogegraphically endemic Cichlid species, reptiles like Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii), Orangebelly Swamp Snake (Tretanorhinus nigroluteus); and mammals, like the Jaguar (Panthera onca), Cougar (Puma concolor), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), the White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu pecari), Spotted Paca (Agouti paca), Red Brocket (Mazama americana), and Spix's Disk-winged Bat (Thyroptera tricolor), and various monkeys species including the endangered <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Howler</b> (Alouatta pigra).|$|E

5000|$|The {{mantled howler}} {{is native to}} Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. Within Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, the mantled howler is found in {{locations}} throughout the countries. In Colombia and Ecuador, it is found in a narrow corridor bordered by the Pacific Ocean {{to the west and}} the Andes Mountains to the east and also in Colombia in a small area near the Caribbean Sea close to the Panama border. In Guatemala, the mantled howler is found through {{the central part of the}} country, and into southeastern Mexico south of the Yucatán Peninsula. The mantled howler is among the most commonly seen and heard primates in many Central American national parks, including Manuel Antonio, Corcovado, Monteverde and Soberania. The mantled howler lives in several different types of forest, including secondary forest and semi-deciduous forest but is found in higher densities in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest.

Objective: To record the diet and activity of <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkeys in crowded conditions during the wettest month in Balancán(Tabasco, México). Methods and methods: The behavioral observations (81 h) were made using the focal animal methodology withan A. pigra troop made up of three individuals (1 adult male, 1 adult female and 1 infant). Results: Feeding time represented 15. 97 %,rest 78 % and locomotion 4. 57 % of total time. In the study area we recorded 14 plant species, with 10 being consumed by howlermonkeys. 55 % of feeding time was devoted to the consumption of fruits, 27 % to leaves, 17 % to stems, and 1 % to sprouts. Spondiasmombin was the tree species most consumed, with 61 % of the time invested on it. Conclusion: Like other studies, we confirmed thefrugivore-folivore feeding tendency of the genus Alouatta.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the social relationships among adult females in two multimale-multifemale groups of <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkeys Alouatta pigra during a 14 -month study in Palenque National Park, Mexico.

Relationships among resident females were primarily affiliative, but females of one study group spent {{a higher proportion of}} time in close proximity and engaged in affiliative interactions with one another at higher rates than females in the other study group. The strength of female relationships increased with the birth of an infant. Although no females immigrated during the study period, the temporary association of three extragroup females with our study groups implies that the social system of <b>black</b> <b>howler</b> monkeys is more dynamic than previously suggested.
