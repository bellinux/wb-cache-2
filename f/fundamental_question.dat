25|$|A <b>fundamental</b> <b>question</b> of longstanding {{theoretical}} {{interest is}} to prove lower bounds on {{the complexity and}} exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Ω(NlogN) (i.e., order NlogN or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as cache or CPU pipeline optimization.|$|E
25|$|He was re-elected for {{the term}} 1904–1906. During {{this time the}} union between Sweden and Norway was the <b>fundamental</b> <b>question.</b> The 1903 {{election}} had seen a new party, the Union Party emerge. Their platform being based on promises of negotiations with Sweden concerning Norwegian rights to consulates, they got the Prime Minister position in the second cabinet Hagerup. Castberg, on the other hand, had marked himself as a staunch opponent of the union. In the years up to 1905, the unionists grew disillusioned with Sweden. The second cabinet Hagerup withdrew in March 1905 {{to make way for}} the cabinet Michelsen. Prime Minister Christian Michelsen had been among the founders of the Union Party. However, when forming his cabinet in 1905 he asked Johan Castberg to join it. Castberg turned the offer down, choosing to continue working in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, it {{was shown}} that the nucleic acid purine base adenine can be formed by heating aqueous {{ammonium}} cyanide solutions. Other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also reported. Leslie E. Orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. Research by Stanley L. Miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Research by the Miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. Other work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often. Mechanistic exploration using quantum chemical methods provide a more detailed understanding {{of some of the}} chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>question</b> of molecular biogenesis.|$|E

Thus, a shareholder wealth perspective is increasingly unsatisfactory for accurately answering the two <b>fundamental</b> <b>questions</b> concerning the theory of the firm: that of economic value creation, and the distribution of this economic value.
