40|$|Oxygenation systems, such as bubble-plume diffusers, {{are used}} to improve water quality by {{replenishing}} dissolved oxygen (DO) in the hypolimnia of water-supply reservoirs. The diffusers induce circulation and mixing, which helps distribute DO throughout the hypolimnion. Mixing, however, has also been observed to increase hypolimnetic oxygen demand (<b>HOD)</b> during system operation, thus accelerating oxygen depletion. Two water-supply reservoirs (Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR) and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR)) that employ linear bubble-plume diffusers were studied to quantify diffuser effects on <b>HOD.</b> A recently validated plume model was used to predict oxygen addition rates. The results were used together with observed oxygen accumulation rates to evaluate <b>HOD</b> {{over a wide range}} of applied gas flow rates. Plume-induced mixing correlated well with applied gas flow rate and was observed to increase <b>HOD.</b> Linear relationships between applied gas flow rate and <b>HOD</b> were found for both SHR and CCR. <b>HOD</b> was also observed to be independent of bulk hypolimnion oxygen concentration, indicating that <b>HOD</b> is controlled by induced mixing. Despite transient increases in <b>HOD,</b> oxygenation caused an overall decrease in background <b>HOD,</b> as well as a decrease in induced <b>HOD</b> during diffuser operation, over several years. This suggests that the residual or background oxygen demand decreases from one year to the next. Despite diffuser-induced increases in <b>HOD,</b> hypolimnetic oxygenation remains a viable method for replenishing DO in thermally-stratified water-supply reservoirs such as SHR and CCR...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{administer}} to Indian and Metis student in northern Saskatchewan, the Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test,which,purports to measure perceptual disorders, and to relate the <b>HOD</b> scores to criteria such as age, sex, academic achievement and the menstrual cycle. The sample consisted of three hundred and four male and female subjects between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Seven hypotheses were proposed. The Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test consists of one hundred and forty-five true and false questions which are designed to measure visual, auditory, olfactory, touch, taste and time perception. High <b>HOD</b> scores indicate abnormality. The greater the degree of distortion evident in these areas, the greater the probability the individual suffers from subclinical pellagra, a term recently introduced to refer to these per­ceptual abnormalities. Previous data indicate that perceptual disorders interfere with learning. The results of this investigation and those of previous studies provide evidence as to the feasibility of using the <b>HOD</b> as a diagnostic tool for detecting perceptual changes which are associated with learning and behavioral problems. The findings clearly indicate that subjects with high <b>HOD</b> scores were also experiencing academic difficulties. 1. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores of female subjects were significantly higher than the mean <b>HOD</b> scores of male subjects. 2. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores decreased significantly as age increased. 3. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores of those students who passed their grade were significantly lower than the mean <b>HOD</b> scores of those who failed or quit their grade. 4. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores decreased significantly as average marks increased. 5. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores increased significantly as age-grade differences increased. 6. The mean <b>HOD</b> scores of those students referred to the educational psychologist were higher than the mean <b>HOD</b> scores of those students not referred, although this difference was not statistically significant. 7.

40|$|Leadership is a {{problematic}} topic at universities {{and it is}} therefore difficult to isolate a leadership theory that is applicable to Heads of Department (<b>HODs).</b> The manner in which <b>HODs</b> construe their leadership roles {{is the focus of}} this research project and the study is conducted from a constructivist perspective The university context in which <b>HODs</b> lead is explored in the literature overview. Definitions of leadership, general leadership theories and leadership issues in academe are investigated. The research findings are integrated into a leadership model for <b>HODs,</b> consisting of constructs (leadership behaviours, actions and values) and elements (leadership situations). The following contributions are made by the study: *	The variety roles an <b>HOD</b> has to fulfil is confirmed by the study. However, this study indicates that leadership is interwoven with everything an <b>HOD</b> undertakes. *	<b>HODs</b> construct their roles uniquely, but in general terms most <b>HODs</b> consider academic and scholarly work (own and that of the department) as part of the leadership role they fulfil. Leadership at <b>HOD</b> level at university incorporates both managerial and leadership ideas. *	<b>HODs</b> consider their leadership environment to have qualities of the following known university environments: collegial, enterprise, bureaucratic and corporate. *	This study identifies eight leadership themes with reference to the leadership role of an <b>HOD</b> at university; providing academic guidance, being a figurehead, determining the strategy and positioning the department, liaising with internal and external stakeholders, being a change agent, being a general manager, and being involved in student and staff relations. The following leadership themes can be added to the current body of literature: being a figurehead, own scholarly profile, as well as being involved in staff and student relations.
