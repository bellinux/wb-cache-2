5|$|Mark Xamin of the {{professional}} wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the event a six out of ten, the same rating given to the second Final Resolution event held in December, but lower than the seven and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten given to the 2007 event's ranking by Chris Sokol.|$|E
5|$|The Compaq Center had {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 16,285, which was reduced for Bad Blood. The event grossed US$500,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 10,000—the maximum allowed. The event retailed as $34.95, but was offered {{free of charge}} {{to members of the}} United States armed forces who were returning from the Iraq War. Not counting the buys from military personnel, the event received 285,000 pay-per-view buys. The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7 million, which was greater than the following year's revenue of $18.5 million. Canadian Online Explorers professional wrestling section rated the event a four out of ten possible points. The main event was rated a five out of ten possible points, while the standard match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels rated a seven and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten possible points. Pro Wrestling Torch, a newsletter and wrestling website in operation since 1987, rated the event a three and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten possible points. Both websites criticized the fact that the pay-per-view ended twenty-five minutes before the original scheduled runtime.|$|E
5|$|The {{event is}} remembered for Scott Hall's failure {{to show up}} for the event and for Samoa Joe's unscripted rant against the promotion. It also marks the first time the Feast or Fired match was held.

5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the {{remaining}} 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter. After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood from the ship, and on June 3 the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued in July by the whaler Ravenscraig, and returned home via Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking {{a minute and a}} <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders {{in the top of the}} overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

25|$|After a {{year and}} a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of the ring, he {{returned}} to the ring losing a ten round unanimous decision to Charles Ellis on August 8th 2015. In May of 2017, he defeated Mike Sheppard by sixth round TKO to claim the WBF heavyweight title. Toney is scheduled to fight Sam Pomphrey in Bristol, England on November 25th 2017; in his 93rd professional contest.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, he was {{selected}} to represent Japan at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing {{as a member of}} the national team. At the Olympics, he contributed to the team silver by competing on floor, vault, parallel bars, and high bar. He qualified for the all-around final, where he won the silver medal. His 2nd place win behind China's Yang Wei gave Japan its first Olympic medal in the event in 24 years. He obtained the highest mark of that meet on the floor 15.825 (double Arabian piked <b>half</b> <b>out,</b> triple twist dismount) and had a spectacular high bar routine (Kolman, piked Kovacs). He also qualified through to the floor final, where he placed fifth.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, {{opened the door to}} her house on West Parkside Avenue, she found herself confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door and looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of a closet.|$|E

25|$|The {{sale was}} {{announced}} on the 26th, pending FCC approval. Release the World head Chris Panos pledged to keep as much secular programming as possible, including the NBC affiliation. Still, six full-time staff members left, including Angstadt, leaving the station's engineer Ray McInturff to pull double duty as manager. The station crammed into {{half of its}} building {{in an attempt to}} stabilize its financial situation by renting the other <b>half</b> <b>out.</b> The station's financial trouble brought the attention of the State Corporation Commission, who in March found grounds to block the sale. Television Fredericksburg had been granted an exception from stock-registration requirements under Virginia law, which the state argued should be removed if a controlling stake was to be sold to an out-of-state interest. Television Fredericksburg successfully defended its actions in an April 2 hearing, and the sale was allowed to proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} {{was the first of}} three {{consecutive}} summit finishes that preceded the second rest day. Contador, alongside José Rujano, took the opportunity to further stamp his authority on the race, taking another minute and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of the race's other top riders. Sivtsov lost two minutes and 42 seconds to Contador, and more significantly a little over a minute to the race's other leading riders. This dropped him to sixth place overall. He lost more time on the Zoncolan the next day, though his overall position remained unchanged. Stage 15 was the first time no HTC-Highroad rider occupied a position in the top ten, as Sivtsov dropped to 12th overall by losing close to seven minutes in the Giro's queen stage. Pinotti rebounded a bit from a disappointing second half of the Giro to ride to eighth place in the stage 16 individual time trial.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example for}} Koon's early work is The Equilibrium Series (1983), {{consisting}} {{of one to}} three basketballs floating in distilled water, a project the artist had researched {{with the help of}} Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Total Equilibrium Tanks are completely filled with distilled water and a small amount of ordinary salt, to assist the hollow balls in remaining suspended in the centre of the liquid. In a second version, the 50/50 Tanks, only half the tank is filled with distilled water, with the result that the balls float half in and <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of the water. In addition, Koons conceived and fabricated five unique works for the Encased series (1983–1993/98), sculptures consisting of stacked sporting balls with their original cardboard packaging in glass display case. Also part of the Equilibrium series are posters featuring basketball stars in Nike advertisements and 10 bronze objects, representing lifesaving gear.|$|E

25|$|When the car {{reached a}} {{pre-established}} spot, eight SAS members opened-fire from close range, riddling the Vauxhall with over 200 rounds of high-velocity automatic fire. Tony Doris was immediately hit, and the out-of-control Vauxhall crashed into two parked cars. The shooting continued {{for about ten}} minutes, until the car exploded in flames and set one of the parked vehicles (a Volkswagen Golf) alight. According to an eyewitness, one of the PIRA volunteers returned fire on the SAS after the car crashed. Some reports claim {{at least two of}} the men fled the blazing car and were found lying <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of the vehicle. Some relatives believe the two men had escaped but were then shot and dragged back into the car by SAS members. A crime-scene report stated that a balaclava of one of the men was found some distance away. The bodies were so badly burnt that they had to be identified using dental records. Two rifles were recovered from the charred car. Forensics later found that the weapons had been used in the killings at Leslie Dallas's garage in 1989.|$|E
500|$|The {{event was}} {{attended}} by 900 people and, according to The Wrestling Observer Newsletter, 25,000 people purchased the show on pay-per-view. Chris Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer rated Sacrifice a seven out of ten; the same rating he gave to the 2007 Sacrifice event and higher than TNA's previous event, Lockdown, which he gave a six and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten. TNA's next PPV event, Slammiversary on June8, received the same rating by Jon Waldman. Sokol felt that Sacrifice was a [...] "decent PPV", and [...] "interesting" [...] overall and rated main event a seven and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten; he {{described it as a}} [...] "solid match, with good wrestling". He rated the TerrorDome the highest, an eight out of ten, and the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and The Latin American Xchange versus Kip James and Matt Morgan bout the lowest, a six out of ten. He rated the Finals of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament a seven and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of ten, and said that it was [...] "another solid match between these two teams". Sacrifice received a higher rating than rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Judgment Day PPV event, held on May19, which Bob Kapur gave a six out of ten.|$|E
500|$|At the Movies {{gave the}} film four and {{three and a}} <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars respectively; Pomeranz commended Hartley for [...] "the depth of his {{research}} and for creating a wildly entertaining film experience", and claimed that [...] "for {{those of us who}} remember the films, Not Quite Hollywood is a blast". Sandra Hall, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, gave the film three and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars, believing that [...] "Hartley's own film is much livelier than most of those he is out to celebrate". Jake Wilson of The Age similarly gave the film three and a half stars, but called the film [...] "basically a feature-length advertisement for its subject", saying that it [...] "moves far too rapidly to permit sustained analysis". The Courier-Mails Des Partidge, who gave the film four and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars, disagreed, saying that [...] "Brisk editing means the history is lively and fun", and claimed in homage to The Castle, [...] "Copies of Hartley's film should go straight to pool rooms all over Australia when it becomes available on DVD." [...] Luke Goodsell of Empire Magazine Australasia gave Not Quite Hollywood five out of five stars, calling the film [...] "fast, thrilling and often ribald", while Leigh Paatsch wrote for the Herald Sun that [...] "there is not a single instant where boredom can possibly intrude", dubbing the film [...] "an incredibly energetic and merrily messed-up celebration of Australian B-movies".|$|E

500|$|Chris Beaumont of Blogcritics {{recommended}} the DVD to consumers, giving it {{three and a}} <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars. He noted that the audio quality was [...] "pretty strong," [...] and allows listeners to clearly hear every chord, note, and word that the band outputs, while the crowd noise proves {{that it is a}} live video, but is not so loud that it distracts viewers. Beamount also said that the video's quality [...] "lacks a lot of the polish that more recent recordings have," [...] but he later said that he would rather see it in low quality rather than high quality. Chad Bowar of About.com also gave the DVD three and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars.

500|$|Russell Lewin of SFX {{gave the}} episode {{three and a}} <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars, naming it as Chibnall's best Doctor Who episode. While he noted that [...] "the ending was {{potentially}} {{always going to be}} a let down...And it is", there was [...] "much to enjoy beforehand" [...] such as UNIT and the humour. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it a score of two and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars, feeling that it was [...] "treading water" [...] as a lead-in to the following finale. He described the first twenty minutes as [...] "overpadded" [...] and [...] "heavy on exposition but little else", and pointed out the unexplained action at Rory's hospital. However, he enjoyed Amy and the Doctor's conversation and the [...] "countdown element and the mystery of the cubes", but found the explanation unoriginal and the conclusion too easy.|$|E
500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of four stars saying, [...] "Who {{knew that the}} franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film three and a <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will {{walk out of the}} theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and <b>half</b> <b>out</b> of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E
