2500|$|Bayocean was a yacht {{that was}} built in 1911 to serve the now-vanished resort of Bay Ocean {{on the coast of}} Oregon at the {{entrance}} to Tillamook Bay. [...] Considered an attractive vessel with a clipper bow and twin raked smokestacks, [...] Bayocean was expensive to operate, was [...] "somewhat cranky" [...] at sea, and spent much of the time tied to a dock. [...] In 1913, Bayocean then transferred to San Francisco Bay where it served briefly as an <b>excursion</b> <b>vessel.</b> [...] In 1918, Bayocean was purchased by the U.S. Navy and converted to a patrol vessel. [...] Following a brief active career, Bayocean was laid up again for about two years, as the Navy demobilized and sought to find buyers for its surplus ships. [...] In 1921, the Navy sold Bayocean at auction to the San Francisco concern of Crowley Launch and Tug, now Crowley Maritime.|$|E

50|$|In 1869 the Schuylkill Navigation {{was damaged}} by a flood, {{hindering}} operations {{for some time}} whilst repairs could be made. In 1870, {{its board of directors}} forced by stockholders, the Schuylkill Navigation Company leased its waterway to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad for 110 years, surrendering to the competition. Under the railroad's control, the Schuylkill Navigation continued to decline as a general freight carrier, but operated primarily as a coal road, like the Lehigh and Delaware Canals into the 1930s, since for heating and especially, steam power, nearly everyone needed anthracite. The traffic on the canal was expedited by corporate maneuvers when its New York City and New Jersey markets connecting Delaware and Raritan Canal was acquired in 1872 by the competing Pennsylvania Railroad - in a blatant act supporting a bid for monopoly, soon Schuylkill boats were denied access to this important New Jersey waterway. As a result, traffic on the Schuylkill decreased rapidly. Adding insult to injury, the PRR itself invaded the Schuylkill's territory with the construction of its Schuylkill Branch in the mid-1880s. By 1890 only 144,994 tons of cargo passed through the Schuylkill Navigation. The Schuylkill Navigation was also hindered by coal silt deposits that made its upper sections almost unusable. By 1891 the portion of Navigation above Port Clinton was abandoned. By 1904 the anthracite traffic had almost completely ceased, and after 1913 only an occasional cargo passed between Port Clinton and Philadelphia. <b>Excursion</b> <b>vessels</b> and pleasure boating remained active on the Schuylkill Navigation until most of the canals were filled by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during 1947-1979 in efforts to remove coal silt from the Schuylkill River.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} a drilling riser exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions at different water depths. The aim is to develop an advisory system for vessel position based on the riser response and also to better predict the transition from operation to a potential disconnect. The advisory system will make use of watch circles which define the limits for normal operation, halt in operation and a possible disconnect. As the most accessible oil reservoirs are exploited, {{there is a need}} for drilling operations at ever greater water depths and in harsher environments. The riser, and its interactions with the vessel and the blow-out preventer (BOP), is a crucial element in a drilling operation. In order to ensure a safe and productive operation, the riser top and bottom angles must be within acceptable limits. For excessive angles, a disconnect from the well is carried out. This will imply a major loss of income, and it is therefore highly undesirable to disconnect when not necessary. However, the consequences of not disconnecting when necessary are even more severe. The riser is exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions which cause it to deflect. The effect from these influences must be investigated in order to predict the riser angles in various conditions and thereby develop watch circles taking these angles into account. The riser has been modeled and analyzed in RIFLEX, a software program developed at MARINTEK for static and dynamic analysis of slender marine structures. In order to investigate the response in both shallow and deep waters, water depths of 300 and 2000 [m] have been applied. The riser is exposed to unidirectional current, regular waves and vessel motions. The top tension is kept constant for each water depth. At 300 [m] water depth, the riser was found to be highly affected by vessel offsets, and the control objective for this depth must be to avoid any offset. At 2000 [m] water depth, however, both lower and upper angle will stabilize at acceptable magnitudes for the maximum static vessel offset studied in this thesis. The upper angle will however be excessive during the movement. The lower angle will not immediately respond to a motion at the top end of the riser, and it increases slowly for an increasing vessel offset. Hence, for a drive-off, which is an uncontrolled <b>excursion</b> of the <b>vessel</b> due to a failure in the DP system, the DP operator will have some time before a disconnect has to be carried out. The current affects the riser considerably more in deep waters compared to shallow waters. Also, first-order waves affect the upper angle significantly more than the lower angle, both in shallow and deep water. The watch circles which have been developed prove that the limits for a halt in the operation and a possible disconnect are larger than the conventional guidance limits. By allowing the top angle to become excessive during a limited amount of time, one can uphold the operation for a longer period of time, and also avoid an unnecessary disconnect. The main contributions in this thesis are the simulation study of the drilling riser and the proposed guidance limits for operation and disconnect.  </p...|$|R
