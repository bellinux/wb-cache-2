5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the <b>interlocutor,</b> whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did not attack Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a formal agreement, which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate <b>interlocutor.</b> Goyeneche agreed to sign an armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he actually used the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with the truce still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared the truce broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E

25|$|Tambo and Bones were {{favorites}} of the audience, {{and their}} repartee with the <b>interlocutor</b> was for many {{the best part}} of the show. There was an element of laughing with them for the audience, as they frequently made light of the interlocutor's grandiose ways.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interlocutor</b> was {{responsible}} for beginning and ending each segment of the show. To this end, {{he had to be}} able to gauge the mood of the audience and know when it was time to move on. Accordingly, the actor who played the role was paid very well in comparison to other non-featured performers.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Children {{with complex}} {{communication}} needs benefit from alternative communication when their <b>interlocutors</b> make {{good use of}} this resource. Objective: Describe the process of alternative communication training of <b>interlocutors</b> for children with cerebral palsy. Method: The participants were children with cerebral palsy and their <b>interlocutors</b> in the respective environments: teacher (school), mother (home) and physiotherapist (clinic). We used instruments to characterize the participants, analysis of mime dynamics, selection of figures, analysis of the footage and perception of participants on the implementation of alternative communication. The data collection and analysis were organized in five stages: knowledge of communicative skills, theoretical and practical training, preparation of the communication board, and evaluation of the training. Results: In the theoretical formation, the sensitization allowed the <b>interlocutors</b> to understand the child’s daily difficulty to communicate without the use of oral communication. This resulted, {{in the course of the}} practical training sessions, in the increase of the strategies offered by the <b>interlocutors</b> during the activities, therefore, increasing the child’s chance of responding with the use of alternative communication figures. Conclusion: The training of three <b>interlocutors</b> for a child with cerebral palsy favored that alternative communication in three contexts of the child’s development. The theoretical-practical support offered to the <b>interlocutors</b> in three natural contexts can provide greater independence and social participation of a child with non-speaking cerebral palsy in the accomplishment of daily activities...|$|R
30|$|Metacultural {{competence}} {{goes beyond}} the matter of awareness and involves {{the ability to use}} certain strategies, such as conceptual explication strategy, which is a conscious effort made on the part of <b>interlocutors</b> to clarify relevant conceptualisations with which they think other <b>interlocutors</b> may not be familiar. For example, Chinese English speakers may elaborate on the cultural schema of guanxi after they use English words such as ‘relationship’ if they are unsure their <b>interlocutors</b> are familiar with this Chinese cultural schema.|$|R
50|$|Gumperz was {{interested}} in how the order of situations {{and the culture of}} the <b>interlocutors</b> affect the way in which <b>interlocutors</b> make conversational inferences and interpret verbal or non-verbal signs which he called contextualization cues (overlapping terms by other scholars include paralanguage and kinesics).|$|R
25|$|Another work {{attributed}} to Lawrence, the Consolatio de Morte Amici , is a prosimetrum of 15 metra and 16 prose sections, closely modelled on Boethius's De Consolatione Philosophiae. Lawrence, grieving {{over the death}} of his friend Paganus, is persuaded not to mourn by an <b>interlocutor,</b> who insists on the immortality of Paganus soul and God's love.|$|E
25|$|In the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel Metatron is not {{identified}} as Enoch. Instead he {{is identified as}} the archangel Michael. The text also records that Metatron in gematria {{is the equivalent of}} Shadday. While he also appears in other apocalyptic writings he is most prominent in the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel. In these writings he plays the role of heavenly <b>interlocutor</b> delivering knowledge about the coming messianic age.|$|E
25|$|Infamous premiered at the August 2006 Venice Film Festival. It {{differs from}} the earlier Capote in that it {{occasionally}} breaks away from the Kansas setting to allow Capote's Manhattan society friends and professional acquaintances to comment on and express opinions about him to an unseen <b>interlocutor</b> during mock interviews. It also is more explicit about the romantic feelings Capote and Perry Smith may have shared.|$|E
40|$|The author uses spoken {{discourse}} {{taken from}} a live television political news debate to reveal the techniques and strategies used by three <b>interlocutors</b> {{as they attempt to}} achieve their goals and agendas. Frameworks from the fields of conversation analysis (henceforth CA) and genre analysis are used to analyse the data. The data show how the interaction starts within the constraints of a television news interview before becoming combative as the <b>interlocutors</b> jostle to achieve their personal goals and agendas. The paper also notes audience involvement and who the <b>interlocutors</b> are addressing during their turns...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the lending behaviour of the International Monetary Fund (IMF or Fund). In {{contrast to the}} existing literature, which attributes IMF lending to powerful member state interests and various economic determinants, I argue that the emergence of <b>interlocutors</b> sympathetic to the staff’s policy goals critically shapes the Fund’s willingness to “supply ” a loan of a particular size {{as well as a}} government’s willingness to “demand ” it. Similar professional training and work experience are critical factors, as they foster close ties between the Fund staff and their domestic <b>interlocutors</b> as well as shared understandings about the “appropriate ” direction for policy. The Fund staff seek out sympathetic <b>interlocutors</b> due to normative biases and career advancement incentives, while sympathetic <b>interlocutors</b> seek out the Fund because they desire assistance in their domestic political struggles. I assess these arguments using a new dataset capturing the professional training characteristics of IMF staff and emerging market and developing country officials. The evidence strongly suggests that sympathetic <b>interlocutors</b> matter: larger loans are extended to countries where government officials and the Fund staff share similar training...|$|R

25|$|In 1837, Prešeren met Emil Korytko, a Polish {{political}} activist from Galicia, confined by the Austrian authorities to Ljubljana. Korytko introduced to Prešeren {{the work of}} Adam Mickiewicz, which had an important influence on his later works. The two even jointly translated one of Mickiewicz's poems ("Resygnacja") from Polish to Slovene and started collecting Slovene folk songs in Carniola and Lower Styria. In 1839, Korytko died, leaving Prešeren without an important <b>interlocutor</b> after Čop's death.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{sentiment}} analysis aims {{to determine the}} attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or <b>interlocutor).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Crown Princess Marie José {{involved}} {{herself in}} vain attempts {{to arrange a}} separate peace treaty between Italy and the United States, and her <b>interlocutor</b> from the Vatican was Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, a senior diplomat who later became Pope Paul VI. Her attempts were not sponsored by the king and Umberto was not (directly, at least) involved in them. After her failure – she never met the American agents – she was sent with her children to Sarre, in Aosta Valley, and isolated from the political life of the Royal House.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{dimension of}} linguistic variation is formality. This study investigates {{the role of}} social distance between <b>interlocutors.</b> Twenty-five native Dutch speakers retold eight short films to confederates, who acted either formally or informally. Speakers were familiarized with the informal confederates, whereas the formal confederates remained strangers. Results show that {{the two types of}} <b>interlocutors</b> elicited different versions of the same stories. Formal <b>interlocutors</b> (large social distance) elicited lower articulation rates, and more nouns and prepositions, both indicators of explicit information. Speakers addressing <b>interlocutors</b> to whom social distance was small, however, provided more explicit information with an involved character (i. e. adjectives with subjective meanings). They also used the word and more often as a gap filler or as a way to keep the floor. Furthermore, {{they were more likely to}} laugh and to use more interjections, first-person pronouns and direct speech, which are all indicators of involvement, empathy and subjectivity...|$|R
25|$|Lunde and Stone have {{provided}} the English reader with a fluent translation of some three quarters of al-Mas‘udi's material on the Abbasids from the Muruj al-dhahab. This {{is in the form}} of more than two hundred passages, many of these containing amusing and informative anecdotes. The very first one recounts the meeting of al-Mansur and a blind poet unaware of the identity of his distinguished <b>interlocutor.</b> The poet on two separate occasions recites praise poems for the defeated Umayyads to the Abbasid caliph; al-Mansur good naturedly rewards him.|$|E

The existing 7 water and wastewater companies (2 in Cairo, 2 in Alexandria, and the 3 in the Nile Delta) as well as the existing 7 Public Economic Authorities were all transformed into Affiliated Companies of the Holding Company. While the Holding Company did not become responsible for investment, it was responsible for the acquisition of equipment to modernize its Affiliated Companies and for training their staff. Also, it became a key <b>interlocutor</b> for foreign donors.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trouble with}} Kurzman's {{interesting}} {{book is the}} author's credulity; he uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made {{to him by his}} principal German <b>interlocutor,</b> the former SS General Karl Wolff, who died in 1984. The book's documentation is modest; the short notes and index contain a great number of vague or inaccurate references. Moreover, it is difficult to believe the arguments of an author who so manifestly lacks the language abilities needed for his work. Kurzman seems to know Italian but no German; he misspells German names and uses almost no German-language sources.|$|E

5000|$|Social {{factors may}} include {{a change in}} {{register}} or the familiarity of <b>interlocutors.</b> In accordance with communication accommodation theory, learners may adapt their speech to either converge with, or diverge from, their <b>interlocutor's</b> usage.

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her <b>interlocutor</b> from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.|$|E
25|$|After 1840, Prešeren {{was left}} without any <b>interlocutor</b> who could {{appreciate}} his works, {{but continued to}} write poetry, although much less than in the 1830s. He gradually departed from the typical romantic trend, adopting an increasingly diverse and innovative style. In 1843, an important breakthrough for Prešeren happened: Janez Bleiweis started publishing a new daily journal in the Slovene language and invited Prešeren to participate in its cultural section. The two men came from rather different backgrounds: Bleiweis was a moderate conservative and staunch supporter of the ecclesiastical and imperial establishments and alien to the Romantic culture. He nevertheless established a fair relationship with the poet. Prešeren's participation in Bleiweis' editorial project was the closest {{he would come to}} public recognition during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden <b>interlocutor)</b> Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E
