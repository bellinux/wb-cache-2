40|$|Abstract. In the Big Data era, users {{increasingly}} {{prefer to}} take clouds as major locations for data storage. With {{the presence of}} cloud computing, vast amounts of data bring huge social and economic benefits to all of us. But this also poses daunting challenges to the <b>data</b> storage <b>security.</b> The existing security measures can no longer {{meet the requirements of}} large <b>data</b> storage <b>security.</b> These threats will emerge as the new bottleneck of information security. As such, this paper classifies the major threats to cloud storage based on analysis on the defining features of Big Data. We also propose protective strategies for big <b>data</b> storage <b>security</b> from the prospective of key storage security technology, management and relevant policy-measures...|$|R
