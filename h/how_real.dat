Back propagation is a critical part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks. How information is coded by real neurons is not known. Sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently. Other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known.|$|E

500|$|Yoshimura {{included}} a B story of Lewis and Falsone looking for Lange's girlfriend to provide comic relief {{and so that}} the entire episode would not be confined to the subway platform location. Yoshimura wanted the two detectives to also discuss the nature of mortality and death, but deliberately included black humor in their dialogue and made sure the characters did not act [...] "teary-eyed [...] philosophical", because he believed it would be clichéd and an inaccurate depiction of <b>how</b> <b>real</b> detectives would behave. Some viewers were offended or startled by the flippant nature of the discussions about death between the two characters.

The character of Magnussen was originally conceived as an American retaining the name of Milverton, but Moffat changed both his nationality and name when Mikkelsen was cast. He found the name Magnussen on a website of Danish names, looking for one that resembled Milverton, the name of the original character from Doyle's short story. Gatiss noted that the character is a [...] "fascinating new place to go" [...] due to his differences from Moriarty. When Mikkelsen received the script, he stated that his first impression was that it was [...] "the best script I've ever read". Contrasting Magnussen to Moriarty, Cumberbatch stated that he was [...] "so chilling because of <b>how</b> <b>real</b> he is, how normal he is", and that he is [...] "not driven by a mad, chaotic joker's energy that Moriarty has".|$|E

500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally <b>how</b> <b>real,</b> how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

After that, Holmes says that the plot seemed to write itself out. HarperCollins requested Holmes to produce a book every three months. Upon hearing this, Holmes invited Cherith Baldry into the team in order to keep up with the schedule. Holmes says she chose Baldry because [...] "her natural writing style was quite close to mine and Kate's, so I knew that Cherith's voice would fit".|$|E

[...] "...It was Leskov who dissected Rus thoroughly," [...] Gorky said (through his character Klim Samgin), later explaining: [...] "Leskov was... the only Russian author to have succeeded in separating the whole generation of his countrymen into a new set of sub-classes, each belonging to a different epoch."

He commented: [...] "EastEnders goes live and the makeover miracle of Albert Square is born." [...] He said that character Alfie Moon [...] "made the unfortunate transition into his very own Mr Hyde, Shane Richie" [...] {{and said that the}} cast were shouting every line so they could be heard over the extras.
