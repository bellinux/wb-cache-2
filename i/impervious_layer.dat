25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a drain pipe.|$|E

50|$|At Treak Cliff {{and nearby}} Blue John Cavern, the {{fluorspar}} is uniquely banded, ranging from blue-black to white. The exact {{cause of the}} coloration is disputed, {{but it seems that}} the formation of Blue John requires a rare combination of porous limestone containing a little hydrocarbon, small traces of radioactive elements, an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> to prevent the mineral fluids and hydrocarbons from escaping, a high concentration of fluorine ions, and variations in conditions during the crystallization process to form the banded colours. The rarity of this combination of conditions explains the scarcity of Blue John.|$|E
5000|$|Ceramic glaze is an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> or {{coating of}} a {{vitreous}} substance {{which has been}} fused to a ceramic body through firing.

It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on stoneware and porcelain. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.|$|E

50|$|The {{sandy and}} gravelly Glacial Lake Iroquois beach is {{a remnant of}} the Wisconsin glaciation. It was {{deposited}} by Lake Iroquois, the precursor to Lake Ontario, about 12,500 year ago. As the lake was shrinking, a line of beach deposits was receding as well, resulting in deposition of sand over the layers of silt and clay that were deposited when the lake was deeper. Following the final recession of the lake, the exposed sand layers were soaked by rainfall. Due to <b>impervious</b> <b>layers</b> underneath, high water table resulted in formation of large areas of swamps and marshes. Eastern parts of the conservation area are occupied by treed swamps and thicket swamps under the power transmission lines, where trees were removed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} soil losses from pipe {{networks}} in irrigated {{fields in the}} Ebro Basin, Spain. The factors encouraging the evolution of pipes are the number of irrigations, the type of crop, the existence of more <b>impervious</b> <b>layers</b> in the C soil horizon and the hydraulic gradient. The water used for irrigation is a low-salinity water, frequently unsaturated in calcite and dolomite. It therefore dissolves some of the soil carbonate and takes calcium from the exchange complex, thus contributing to soil dispersion and erosion. From monitoring the hydromorphological behaviour of two pipe networks, soil loss from the affected plots is estimated at 3 t ha- 1 yr- 1. The evolution of piping causes important losses of soil and water {{and can lead to}} the abandonment of farm land. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|In heap {{leaching}} processes, crushed (and sometimes agglomerated) ore is piled {{in a heap}} which is lined with an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer.</b> Leach solution is sprayed {{over the top of}} the heap, and allowed to percolate downward through the heap. The heap design usually incorporates collection sumps, which allow the [...] "pregnant" [...] leach solution (i.e. solution with dissolved valuable metals) to be pumped for further processing. An example is gold cyanidation, where pulverized ores are extracted with a solution of sodium cyanide, which, in the presence of air, dissolves the gold, leaving behind the nonprecious residue.|$|E
50|$|Water quality. Poor {{water quality}} {{is a concern}} both at the source and {{at the point of}} use. Groundwater below Mexico City was {{initially}} believed to be protected from contamination by a thick <b>impervious</b> <b>layer.</b> However, this layer has fractured due to land subsidence. Furthermore, the natural upward flow of water in the artesian aquifer has now been reversed due to groundwater depletion. The Groundwater under Mexico City thus is believed to be increasingly vulnerable to contaminants from waste dumps and industrial sites leaching to the aquifer. Furthermore, the deep drainage system penetrates below the clay aquitard in some places into the main aquifer. During periods of heavy rain, waste water seeps out from the deep tunnels into the surrounding subsoil contaminating the aquifer.|$|E
50|$|In moist climates, soils may be {{adequate}} for cropping {{with the exception}} that they become waterlogged for brief periods each year, from snow melt or from heavy rains. Soils that are predominantly clay will pass water very slowly downward, meanwhile plant roots suffocate because the excessive water around the roots eliminates air movement through the soil.Other soils may have an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> of mineralized soil, called a hardpan or relatively impervious rock layers may underlie shallow soils. Drainage is especially important in tree fruit production. Soils that are otherwise excellent may be waterlogged for a week of the year, which is sufficient to kill fruit trees and cost the productivity of the land until replacements can be established. In each of these cases appropriate drainage carries off temporary flushes of water to prevent damage to annual or perennial crops.|$|E

40|$|Land {{subsidence}} due to subsurface fluid withdrawal {{is often}} predicted by either finite element or finite difference models based on tha coupled poroelastic theory, where {{the soil is}} represented as a semi-infinite medium bounded by the traction-free ground surface. One of the variables playing a most important role on the final outcome is the flow condition used on the traction-free boundary, which may be assumed as either permeable or impermeable. Although occasionally justified, the assumption of no-flow surface seems to be rather unrealistic. A permeable boundary where the pore pressure is fixed to the external atmospheric pressure {{appears to be more}} appropriate. This paper addresses the response in terms of land subsidence obtained with a coupled poroelastic finite element model that simulates a distributed pumping from a horizontal aquifer confined two relatively <b>impervious</b> <b>layers,</b> and takes either a permeable boundary surface, i. e., constant hydraulic potential, or an impermeable boundary, i. e., a zero Neumann flow condition. The analysis reveals that land subsidence is rather sensitive to the flow condition implemented on the traction-free boundary. In general, the no-flow condition leads to an overestimate of the predicted ground surface settlement, which could even be one order of magnitude larger than that obtained with the permeable boundary...|$|R

40|$|Most drain spacing {{calculations}} do {{not take}} the horizontal flow in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater table into consideration. In this paper, a solution is presented that includes the contribution of unsaturated flow above the groundwater table. Drain spacing calculated with the newly derived equation is compared to that calculated with the Hooghoudt equation and the two-dimensional Hydrus- 2 D model. Results show that drain spacing calculated with the new equation results in a wider value. The effects are most pronounced for tiles located close to the <b>impervious</b> <b>layer,</b> particularly in coarse, sandy soils. These effects rapidly decrease if {{the depth of the}} <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> increases. The effect of the unsaturated zone flow contribution is limited to sandy soils, for low infiltration ratios and tiles placed on top of an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer.</b> The maximum increase in drain spacing calculated by the new formula is about 30 % higher, suggesting that inclusion of the contribution of the unsaturated zone flow in the computation of drain spacing may result in greater economy in the design of subsurface drainage systems. Moreover, the new equation is more general and is applicable for tiles lying on or far from an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Existing {{analytical}} {{solutions for}} vertical influent seepage flow to an infinite series of tile drains underlain by an <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> do not adequately consider the free surface nor give {{solutions for the}} drain diameter (see Figure 1). The theoretical investigations described herein basically sought to find a method whereby an engineer could find the required diameter, depth, and spacing of an adequate tile drainage system when given the ratio of infiltration to soil hydraulic conductivity {{and the depth of}} the <b>impervious</b> <b>layer.</b> From a study of the available literature it was decided the problem would be exceedingly difficult to solve exactly but it seemed as if an approximate solution of good accuracy could be obtained by approximating the shape of the <b>impervious</b> <b>layer,</b> where the flow is sluggish, and satisfying the conditions exactly at the free surface, a critical region of flow. Previously published solutions invariably adopt the opposite viewpoint, with a consequent loss in accuracy. The solution to the problem when the <b>impervious</b> <b>layer</b> is at infinite depth had been solved exactly using the rather laborious hodograph technique. This work employs to advantage an image method developed by Davison and Rosenhead (1940). Detailed results are obtained herein for the condition when no water stands over the tile lines and these are given in a graphical form which enables a ready computation of drain depth diameter and spacing when the field data are known (ratio of rate of infiltration to hydraulic conductivity and the depth of the <b>impervious</b> <b>layer).</b> A comparison with field results shows that the solutions are probably as accurate as could be desired. The case which occurs when water stands over the tile lines has not been extensively tabulated for reasons explained in the report. A method is given whereby adequate tile drainage systems may be designed on a long term basis. The design curves given are not for intermittent unsteady flows such as irrigation schemes (a more difficult problem) but should prove exceedingly useful for engineers concerned with land reclamation schemes and marsh drainage...|$|E
