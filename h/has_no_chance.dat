This vote will then be transferred at full value and carry more weight in determining the winners at the later stages of the count. This strategy can be effective due to two features of some STV counting systems.|$|E
25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless {{it is obvious that}} the ball <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded. If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.|$|E
25|$|Unwilling {{to accept}} that Oogway's {{decision}} was intentional, Shifu tries {{to get rid of}} Po through a torturous and agonizing training regime. The Furious Five also scorn and disparage Po as an upstart with no skill or potential in kung fu. However, after receiving encouragement from Oogway, Po endures his training and slowly begins to befriend the Five with his tenacity, culinary skill, and good humor. Meanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison as foreseen by Oogway, ironically picking his locks with one of Zeng's fallen feathers. Shifu learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of defeating Tai Lung. Shifu, however, discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food. Using this as positive reinforcement, Shifu successfully trains Po to incorporate these feats into an effective kung fu style.|$|E

500|$|Roark {{is opposed}} {{by what he}} calls [...] "second-handers", who value {{conformity}} over independence and integrity. These include Roark's former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles, but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark's career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel's most controversial character is Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique's first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape.|$|E
500|$|Everyone in {{the office}} tells Andy that quitting is a foolish move and that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of {{achieving}} stardom. Andy eventually goes back on his decision, and David allows him to stay on in a sales position. However, mere hours later Andy feels that he is only sticking with his Dundler-Mifflin job because it is safe {{and that he has}} to take a shot at achieving fame. Fearing his conviction will falter a second time, he decides he cannot simply quit, but get fired. This proves difficult as he is unable to make himself go through with any offense more serious than defecating on David's car. Andy bids farewell to his coworkers with an unexpectedly moving rendition of [...] "I Will Remember You", prompting them to comment to the documentary crew that he may have star potential after all.|$|E

However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes her shoes and some excess clothing to get comfortable, asks for wine, and turns down the light and asks if she can stay over a second night. As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: [...] "Never get engaged." [...] Jerry then realizes that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> with Laura, but has already committed himself – and his one-bedroom apartment – to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan.|$|E

500|$|Battleships {{were the}} largest and most complex, and hence the most {{expensive}} warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, [...] "The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people". The Jeune École school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a sea denial strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the Jeune École were ahead of their time; {{it was not until the}} 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented. The determination of powers such as Germany to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet that <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of matching its opponent in an actual battle.|$|E
500|$|On May 19, 2011, Ocean's {{record label}} Def Jam {{announced}} {{its plans to}} release an EP containing tracks from nostalgia, Ultra.

The EP was originally scheduled to be released on July 26, 2011, however, Ocean noted on his official Tumblr page on July 24, 2011 that Nostalgia, Lite would no longer be released on July 26 and that the project was cancelled.

Talking about which other songs would make it onto the reissue, Ocean commented that [...] "The Eagles sample 'American Wedding' <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> in hell of being cleared". He continued, [...] "Coldplay sample 'Strawberry Swing', possibly. I hear 'possibly' from people who say they know. MGMT, those guys seem chill. I heard they heard the record 'Nature Feels' and they liked it a lot, so hopefully that can go someway." [...] Other tracks on the reissue were set to be [...] "Acura Integurl", which appeared on the unofficial release The Lonny Breaux Collection, and [...] "Whip Appeal" [...] which was released in 2012. In 2012, Ocean commented again on his blog that [...] "Nostalgia Lite is [...] "never coming out." ...|$|E
