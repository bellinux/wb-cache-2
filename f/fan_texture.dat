40|$|New {{gray level}} control {{technique}} for antiferroelectric liquid crystal cells under phase transition from field-induced ferroelectric state to antiferroelectric {{state has been}} investigated. Continuous gray level was realized by optimizing the holding voltage and was {{closely related to the}} value of the interval pulse voltage divided by the interval pulse width. From stroboscopic micrographs, a multi-domain of ferroelectric domains and antiferroelectric domains was stabilized due to the pinning effect of focal-conic <b>fan</b> <b>texture</b> along the smectic layer direction. 電界誘起強誘電状態から反強誘電状態への相転移を利用した，反強誘電性液晶の新しい中間調制御技術について検討した。ホールド電圧の最適化により中間調が実現され，本中間調レベルは（パルス電圧）／（パルス幅）値に密接に関係していた。ストロボ観察の結果から，強誘電と反強誘電の状態からマルチドメイン状態は，スメクチック層方向に関してフォーカルコニックファン組織によるピンニング効果で安定化されていた...|$|E

A [001] <b>fan</b> <b>texture</b> {{was observed in}} HfAl 3 grown by solid state diffusion on textureless hafnium substrates. If layers were grown on a hafnium substrate with a pronounced single-component sheet texture, the texture in the HfAl 3 layer was not rotationally symmetric around the direction of diffusion, but a related sheet texture developed. An orientation relation is proposed. Layers grown from the vapour phase on aluminium substrates show an 841 fibre texture...|$|E

The samples had <b>fan</b> <b>texture</b> with an improved texture alignment at higher sintering temps. The sample sintered at 1320 Deg showed giant growth with 250 mm crystals. The orientation of these, studied by Laue transmission, confirmed a superior orientation of the coarse grains resulting from the growth of the favorably oriented grains at the expense of the less favorably oriented grains.

40|$|Epoxy {{composites}} with biphenyl liquid crystalline polyester (BLCP) -grafted graphene oxides (GO) as inclusions {{were prepared}} successfully. The thermal and texture analyses of BLCP {{were characterized by}} DSC and POM. The {{results show that the}} texture structure of BLCP turned into <b>fan</b> <b>texture</b> from woven texture with increasing temperature and present double texture structure. More importantly, the thermal and mechanical properties of epoxy composites could be improved by incorporating BLCP-grafted GO (BLCP-GO). The epoxy composite with only 0. 5 wt% BLCP-GO produced an increase in the initial decomposition temperature (T (d)) by 28 A degrees C and glass transition temperature (T (g)) by 17. 2 A degrees C when compared with the neat epoxy. Moreover, for the mechanical properties tests, the composites with 1. 0 wt% BLCP-GO exhibit an increase in impact strength, tensile strength, flexural strength and flexural modulus by 103, 52, 66, and 56 %, respectively, compared with the neat epoxy resin. These excellent performances of the graphene-epoxy composites have a great potential for applications in aerospace and other electrical devices...|$|E
40|$|Focal conic domains (FCDs) in smectic-A liquid {{crystals}} {{have drawn}} much attention both for their exquisitely structured internal form {{and for their}} ability to direct the assembly of micro- and nanomaterials in a variety of patterns. A key to directing FCD assembly is control over the eccentricity of the domain. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm for creating spatially varying FCD eccentricity by confining a hybrid-aligned smectic with curved interfaces. In particular, we manipulate interface behavior with colloidal particles in order to experimentally produce two examples of what has recently been dubbed the flower texture, where the focal hyperbolae diverge radially outward {{from the center of the}} texture, rather than inward as in the canonical eventail or <b>fan</b> <b>texture.</b> We explain how this unconventional assembly can arise from appropriately curved interfaces. Finally, we present a model for this system that applies the law of corresponding cones, showing how FCDs may be embedded smoothly within a "background texture" of large FCDs and concentric spherical layers, in a manner consistent with the qualitative features of the smectic flower. Such understanding could potentially lead to disruptive liquid crystal technologies beyond displays, including patterning, smart surfaces, microlens arrays, sensors and nanomanufacturing...|$|E
40|$|E) -N-alkyl- 4 -(2 -(4 -dimethylaminophenyl) ethenyl) pyridinium {{bromides}} (hemicyanine bromides) with C- 14, C- 16 and C- 18 straight alkyl {{chains are}} described. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and by optical microscopy. The textures observed in polarised light revealed that these compounds exhibit a smectic A mesophase. A focal-conic <b>fan</b> <b>texture</b> was observed, together with regions showing homeotropic alignment. The phase behaviour of the compound with the C(1) 6 chain can be summarized as: Cr- 1. 99. Cr- 2. 249. SmA. 268. I (dec.). The transition temperatures are rather independent {{of the length of}} the alkyl chain. The compounds have a strong tendency to supercool to a glassy mesophase. A structural model for the mesophase is proposed. The bromide anion of the hemicyanine bromides can be replaced by the bulky tetrakis(beta-diketonato) lanthanide(III) anion. As the beta-diketone, 2, 4 -pentanedione (acetylacetone, acac) and 1, 3 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -propanedione (dibenzoylmethane, DBM) are chosen. None of the lanthanide complexes containing the hemicyanine chromophore shows a mesophase. The complexes either melt directly to an isotropic liquid, or decompose without melting. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} {{to design and}} synthesis of Schiff's base symmetrical liquid crystal dimmers and to study the effect of molecular structure variation (o-ortho, m-meta, p-para) and change in alkoxy terminal chain length on mesomorphic properties of liquid crystals, We have synthesized Schiff base dimers from dialdehyde derivative containing 2 -hydroxy- 1, 3 -dioxypropylene as short spacer with aniline derivatives having different lengths of terminal alkoxy chains (n = 5, 7, 9). The chemical structure of the final products was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The mesomorphic properties and optical textures of the resultant dimers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The existence of smectic A phase transition was confirmed by the observation of bâtonnets and <b>fan</b> shaped <b>textures</b> in optical microscopy when compound were heated from crystalline phase. All of the dimers of this series, {{with the exception of}} 2 S 5 -ortho,-meta,-para, were thermotropic liquid crystal. The compound 2 S 9 -meta was monotropic, while the rest were enantiotropic. It was found that the change in terminal alkoxy chain length has pronounced effect on the mesomorphic properties.

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on the {{characteristic}} optical textures exhibited by mixts. of nematic and cholesteric compds., namely, N-(p-propoxybenzylidene) -p-pentylaniline (PBPA) and cholesteryl Et carbonate (CEC). Many of the textures are metastable and undergo a slow transformation at room temp. {{in the course of}} some days or weeks. The optical properties and textures obsd. near room temp. are characteristic of the cholesteric mesophase in the case of mixts. with concns. of PBPA < 35 % as also at the higher concns. â�¥ 90 %. For concns. of PBPA at 40 - 90 %, the optical textures obsd. near room temp. are characteristic of the smectic mesophase. The n data obtained in the different cases confirm the above identifications. Wherever the cholesteric texture has a sufficiently large pitch, it is possible to observe the striped pattern characteristic of the periodic variation of the n assocd. with the helicoidal arrangement of the mols. in cholesteric layers. Numerous other features like the <b>fan</b> and focal-conic <b>textures,</b> drops and diffraction effects are also illustrated. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|Novel liquid {{crystalline}} poly(p-phenylene) s (PPP) bearing cyanoterphenyl mesogenic pendants {{with varying}} spacer lengths {-[C 6 H 3 -COO-terphenyl-CN](n) -, P(0); -[C 6 H 3 -COO-(CH 2) (6) -O-terphenyl-CN](n) -, P(6) } were designed and synthesized, {{and the effects}} of structural variations on the liquid crystallinity behaviors and the optical properties of the polymers are studied. P(0) shows an SmA phase with faint birefringence, while P(6) readily forms the enantiotropic SmA(d) phase with a colorful <b>fan</b> <b>texture,</b> due to the longer flexible spacer favoring the better packing arrangements. Photoexcitation of their solutions induces strong blue light emission. The photoluminescence of P(6) in THF solution is much stronger and redshifted to the visible spectral region, even extending to 600 nm, than that of P(0). The longer spacer may have better segregated the bulky chromophoric pendants, which effectively hampers the excitons from traveling to the quenching sites of the backbone and hence enhances the stronger emission in the photoluminescence. No significant shifts in the emission maxima are observed when the polymers are fabricated into thin films, Suggesting that the segregation of the backbone effectively decreases the strong interchain interaction. Another interesting and outstanding property also could be found in this type of polymers. Due to the stric crowding, cyanoterphenyl mesogen pendants orientating around the main chain forces the main chain showing spiral conformation along the main chain in the long region; moreover, a short spacer is favorable...|$|E
