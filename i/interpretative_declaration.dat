5000|$|On 12 September the Court {{refused to}} grant an injunction, but imposed several {{conditions}} for ratification. The argument that all future ESM bailouts should be individually {{approved by the}} German parliament was confirmed by the court. However, {{the court found that}} the argument that the treaty might permit the ESM to borrow funds directly from the ECB had no merit, as this was incompatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Finally, the court stipulated that Germany must attach an <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> to their instrument of ratification of the treaty declaring that their liability is limited to the €190 billion committed in the treaty unless an increase is approved by the German parliament, and that the confidentiality of information by the ESM will not prevent the German parliament from being informed on the workings of the ESM. Furthermore, the court stated that [...] "Germany must express that it does not wish to be bound by the ESM Treaty in its entirety, if the reservations made by it should prove to be ineffective." [...] On 27 September 2012, the eurozone countries adopted a joint <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> of the ESM treaty formalizing the [...] "German interpretation". [...] After a German court rejected a last minute appeal claiming that this declaration failed to satisfy the imposed requirements, Germany completed its ratification of the treaty. The court heard oral arguments on the merits of the case and the ECB's bond buying OMT program for countries exiting ESM financial support programs on 11-12 June 2013, with a final decision originally expected in the fall of 2013 but later pushed back to 2014. [...] In early February 2014 the court announced that they had referred the question of the OMT program to the European Court of Justice, and on 18 March the court released their decision which found that all the complaints against the ESM treaty were either inadmissible or unfounded.|$|E
5000|$|The Latvian Foreign Ministry has reiterated [...] "that Latvia has no {{territorial}} {{claims to}} the Russian Federation", however, and though there is some opposition (particularly among right wing parties) to formally ceding the Abrene region, surveys show that most Latvians don't believe that the transferred territory will ever again be administered by Latvia. Many in Latvia - especially the former residents of the areas now in Russia - are interested in seeking compensation from the Russian Federation, though. Currently, the Republic of Latvia compensates those who lost property. The former residents also complain {{of the difficulty of}} visiting their family graves, asking that the Latvian and Russian governments facilitate border procedures. Despite Latvia's assurances that it makes no territorial claims, Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed that Latvian wishes to get control of the area and that such claims are against the spirit of Europe. On April 29, 2005, Latvia announced that it would sign an <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> in conjunction with the proposed border agreement with Russia, noting that the border agreement would in no way affect [...] "the legal rights of the Latvian state and its citizens" [...] under the 1920 treaty. As a consequence, Russia scrapped the border agreement, as it saw this as attempt to prolong debate on Abrene.|$|E
40|$|Interpretativne izjave uz međunarodne ugovore u praksi je katkad teško razlikovati od rezervi uz međunarodne ugovore, pa se te dvije vrste jednostranih akata često miješaju, a nerijetko i izjednačavaju. Premda korištenje interpretativnih izjava kod sklapanja međunarodnih ugovora nije novina, one, za razliku od rezervi, nisu uređene bečkom kodifikacijom prava međunarodnih ugovora. Stoga se s pravom očekivalo da će Komisija Ujedinjenih naroda za međunarodno pravo u Vodiču za praksu glede rezervi uz međunarodne ugovore, koji je usvojen 2011. nakon dugogodišnjeg rada na toj temi, dati jasne smjernice za razlikovanje interpretativnih izjava i rezervi te utvrditi eventualno postojeća specifična pravna pravila. S tih polazišta se u ovom radu, u svjetlu rješenja koja donosi Komisijin Vodič za praksu, najprije analizira pravna priroda i pojam interpretativne izjave u usporedbi s rezervom, a zatim se naznačuju temeljne odrednice mogućeg pravnog režima za interpretativne izjave. In 2011, {{after many}} years of work and study, the International Law Commission (ILC) adopted the {{comprehensive}} Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties. This paper aims to revisit the issue of <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> to treaties {{in the light of the}} relevant guidelines contained in the Guide to Practice. Although <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> have been used by states in treaty practice for a long time, the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) remained entirely silent on the matter. On the other hand, a fair number of the VCLT’s provisions were dedicated to reservations, with which <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> are often confounded. In the first part the VCLT’s definition of reservations is analysed and used as a point of reference for the ensuing discussion on the legal nature of <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations.</b> In that respect, the definition of <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> as enunciated in the ILC’s Guide to Practice is of particular interest. Thereafter, the most important aspects of the legal regime for <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations,</b> as propounded by the ILC, are tackled in some detail. Thus, the specific notion of “conditional interpretative declarations” is explained, whose regime, according to the ILC, is to be assimilated to the one in place for reservations. Conversely, “simple interpretative declarations”, considering that they constitute a proposed interpretation of a treaty, albeit a unilateral one, should essentially be subject to the VCLT’s rules regarding the interpretation of treaties. Given that states, for various reasons, often use the concept of <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> in order to disguise statements, which in fact amount to reservations, special attention is devoted to the method of determining the distinction between reservations and <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations.</b> Indeed, as emphasised in the conclusion of this essay, it is a significant contribution of the Guide to Practice that it has helped to clarify the confusion regarding the legal nature of <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations.</b> It is to be expected that the pertinent guidelines on <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> will influence state practice and prompt further crystallisation of customary international law in the field...|$|R

On its accession Italy deposited with the UN Secretary General an <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> clarifying {{the way in}} which it intends to apply the Convention. Besides dealing with specific aspects of the conventional regime, the declaration underlines that Italy will interpret and apply the New York Convention in conformity with the international principles concerning the protection of human rights from serious violations. In that last respect, the Italian declaration will contribute to strengthening a trend which has clearly emerged in recent years, to set aside immunity in dealing with individual claims when a foreign State has committed gross human rights violations...|$|E

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) was {{the first}} legally binding {{instrument}} explicitly focused on how human rights apply to people with disability. Amongst their obligations, consistent with the social model of disability, the Convention requires signatory nations to recognise that “…persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others {{in all aspects of}} life” and mandates signatory nations to develop “…appropriate measures to provide access by persons with disability to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity”. The Convention promotes supported decision-making as one such measure. Although Australia ratified the UNCRPD in 2008, it retains an <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> in relation to Article 12 (2, 3, 4), allowing for the use of substituted decision-making in situations where a person is assessed as having no or limited decision-making capacity. Such an outcome is common for people with severe or profound intellectual disability because the assessments they are subjected to are focused on their cognition and generally fail {{to take into account the}} interdependent nature of human decision-making. This paper argues that Australia’s <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> is not in the spirit of the Convention nor the social model of disability on which it is based. It starts from the premise that the intention of Article 12 is to be inclusive of all signatory nations’ citizens, including those with severe or profound cognitive disability. From this premise, arises a practical need to understand how supported decision-making can be used with this group. Drawing from evidence from an empirical study with five people with severe or profound intellectual disability, this paper provides a rare glimpse on what supported decision-making can look like for people with severe or profound intellectual disability. Additionally, it describes the importance of supporters having positive assumptions of decision-making capacity as a factor affecting supported decision-making. This commentary aims to give a focus for practice and policy efforts for ensuring people with severe or profound cognitive disability receive appropriate support in decision-making, a clear obligation of signatory nations of the UNCRPD. A focus on changing supporter attitudes rather than placing the onus of change on people with disability is consistent with the social model of disability, a key driver of the UNCRPD...|$|E

50|$|In effect, a {{reservation}} allows {{the state to}} be {{a party to the}} treaty, while excluding the legal effect of that specific provision in the treaty to which it objects.States cannot take reservations after they have accepted the treaty; {{a reservation}} must be made {{at the time that the}} treaty affects the State. The Vienna Convention did not create the concept of reservations but codified existing customary law. Thus even States that have not formally acceded to the Vienna Convention act as if they had. As reservations are defined under the Vienna Convention and <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> are not, the two are sometimes difficult to discern from each other. Unlike a reservation, a declaration is not meant to affect the State's legal obligations but is attached to State's consent to a treaty to explain or interpret what the State deems unclear.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether or}} not current Australian mental health legislation complies with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD) which Australia ratified on 17 July 2008. It analyses the meaning of specific provisions of the CRPD that are most relevant to persons with psychosocial disabilities. It assesses whether mental health legislation should be abolished or reformed. It argues that Australian mental health acts conflict with the CRPD and should be abolished. Given Australia's <b>interpretative</b> <b>declaration</b> on ratifying the CRPD that the CRPD allows for the involuntary detention and treatment of persons with mental disabilities, {{it is unlikely that}} mental health legislation will be abolished in Australian jurisdictions. However, this thesis argues that the CRPD provides a new and tangible normative framework for the reform of mental health laws and this thesis sets out the steps that need to be taken to ensure that persons with psychosocial disabilities have equal standing in society and are protected from being subject to differential treatment in law and practice. The legislation in this thesis is as at 1 July 2011...|$|E

40|$|Forty-seven {{states parties}} to the Convention on the Rights of the Child have {{accompanied}} their ratification of the instrument with reservations or <b>interpretative</b> <b>declarations</b> intended to limit the scope of their obligations. Thus, although the Convention on the Rights of the Child is now the most successful and widely-ratified human rights treaty, with more than 175 states parties, this impressive support for the instrument is regrettably mitigated by the reservations. Of the few holdouts that have failed to ratify, the United States is surely the most important. Though it signed the treaty in February 1995 without reservation, {{there can be no}} doubt that if the United States ever ratifies the Convention this will be associated with a substantial list of reservations should past behavior be any guide. Making reservations to multilateral treaties is a well-accepted practice in international law. It facilitates negotiation of treaties because states know that they may eventually accept an instrument without binding themselves to every single provision. It also encourages ratification, because it is possible for a state to avoid assuming obligations in conflict with certain aspects of its internal legislation...|$|R
