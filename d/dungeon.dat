5|$|<b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2 is a {{strategy}} game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1999 for Microsoft Windows. The sequel to <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper, the player takes {{the role of a}} 'dungeon keeper', building and defending an underground <b>dungeon</b> from the would-be heroes that invade it, as well as from other keepers. In the campaign mode, the player is charged with recovering the portal gems from each area in order to open a portal to the surface. The player can also construct a <b>dungeon</b> without strict objectives, and multiplayer is supported over a network.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dungeon</b> Keeper was {{referenced}} in Theme Hospitals introduction scene twice: {{a doctor}} is briefly seen playing a console version, and the Horned Reaper makes a cameo appearance as a patient. Early concept art for Black & White used <b>Dungeon</b> Keepers Horned Reaper to represent creatures. The Horned Reaper unit {{was so popular}} that the producers of <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2 made it a character with {{an important role in}} the game's story. <b>Dungeon</b> Keepers engine was an inspiration for Minecraft.|$|E
5|$|An {{expansion}} pack, The Deeper Dungeons, {{was released}} on 30 November 1997. It features fifteen new levels each for single player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game. These add-ons, along with the Deeper Dungeons and a <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper-based desktop theme, were bundled with the game, re-released as <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper Gold Edition on 31 December 1998. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper received a fan-made mod, called KeeperFX. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support. A sequel, <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2 was released in 1999, and the series was rebooted by Mythic Entertainment {{with the release of}} a remake (also titled <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper) for iOS and Android on 30 January 2014.|$|E

5|$|Deriving {{from the}} {{concepts}} of tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, and adjusting attributes points and skills. At {{the start of the}} game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a <b>dungeon,</b> with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a <b>dungeon</b> crawl, the player moves the character through the <b>dungeon,</b> collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armors, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and in-game money, while having to fight monsters that roam the <b>dungeon.</b> Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster, which the game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dungeon</b> Keeper {{took over}} two years to develop, and an {{expansion}} pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released. Midway through development, Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog when the game was complete, which was the motivation for its success. Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on Origin in 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} <b>Dungeon</b> Heart and some Imps. The <b>Dungeon</b> Heart has the same purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the <b>dungeon,</b> who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E

5|$|The Famicom {{version of}} Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is a {{traditional}} role-playing video game in which the player takes control of a party composed of two humans {{and a number of}} demons. The party explores a large <b>dungeon</b> using a first-person perspective. The human characters use a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. The items, which can range from healing items to different types of currency, are picked up from enemies or found in chests scattered through the <b>dungeon.</b> Weapons and accessories are purchased at different shops found within the <b>dungeon.</b> Progress is saved using a password system.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a <b>dungeon,</b> recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the <b>dungeon,</b> carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, and interact with them. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

5|$|The {{version for}} {{personal}} computers (PC) is an action role-playing game which plays from a top-down perspective. Controlling Nakajima, the player explores the labyrinthine levels of a <b>dungeon</b> populated by enemies. Combat {{plays out in}} real time, with Nakajima fighting demons using both short-range melee attacks and ranged magic attacks. Each section of the <b>dungeon</b> ends in a powerful boss character.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a <b>dungeon</b> crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the <b>dungeon</b> of monsters. Each <b>dungeon</b> is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the <b>dungeon</b> until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the <b>dungeon</b> over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the <b>dungeon</b> itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the <b>dungeon</b> of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} <b>dungeon.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>dungeon</b> crawler game {{based on}} the story of the company's five founders was made. The game was housed in an arcade cabinet inside Obsidian.|$|E

5|$|Bullfrog Productions {{developed}} <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper 2 {{with a team}} {{of around}} fifty people. The team included people involved in the original <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to capitalize on the original game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the <b>dungeon,</b> and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and <b>Dungeon</b> Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Arts {{dedicated}} Publish 51 in Ultima Online to Gygax. This {{included a}} new {{room in the}} <b>dungeon</b> Doom containing a special encounter and unique decorations.|$|E
50|$|Bounty <b>Dungeons</b> The {{system will}} {{automatically}} refresh Bounty <b>dungeons</b> which are {{integrated into the}} storyline <b>dungeons</b> for you each day. It is an important way to receive Crystals. The difficulty degree is medium.|$|R
50|$|Players {{may receive}} {{different}} equipment from different <b>dungeons.</b> They {{have a chance}} to earn better equipment from more difficult <b>dungeons.</b> They may also receive equipment from drawing cards after they complete the <b>dungeons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} <b>Dungeons</b> & Dragons, the sea hag {{first appeared in}} the Blackmoor supplement by Dave Arneson (1975). The <b>Dungeons</b> & Dragons Basic Set included its own version of the hag. The sea hag and the black hag appeared in the <b>Dungeons</b> & Dragons Master Rules (1985), and the <b>Dungeons</b> & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991).|$|R
5|$|For the 20th {{anniversary of}} Final Fantasy, Square Enix remade Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II for the PlayStation Portable. The games were {{released}} in Japan and North America in 2007, and in European territories in 2008. The PSP version features higher-resolution 2D graphics, full motion video sequences, a remixed soundtrack, {{and a new}} <b>dungeon</b> {{as well as the}} bonus dungeons from Dawn of Souls. The script is the same as in the Dawn of Souls version, aside from the new <b>dungeon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hamauzu has {{not been}} {{involved}} in the production of any other Chocobo soundtracks. Chocobo's <b>Dungeon</b> 2s soundtrack was composed by a group of five composers, and was the last Chocobo game soundtrack to not be mainly composed of remixes of previous Final Fantasy and Chocobo music. Hamauzu was not involved in the creation of either the remixes or original tracks for these albums. His role was filled by Kumi Tanioka for Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's <b>Dungeon,</b> Kenji Ito for Chocobo Racing, and Yuzo Takahashi for Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Molyneux {{decided to}} focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from bitmaps, and there was around 90 {{megabytes}} of graphics data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became evident that the deadline would be missed, and release was pushed back to March 1997. The final testing began in April 1997, and <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper was signed off in June. <b>Dungeon</b> Keeper was released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for Windows 95 and MS-DOS. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.|$|E
