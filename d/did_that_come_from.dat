40|$|AbstractLet Ω⊂RN be a bounded domain {{with smooth}} {{boundary}} ∂Ω and g:Ω¯×R→R be a nonlinear function. We prove existence of two-dimensional bifurcation surfaces for the elliptic boundary value problem−Δu=au−+bu++g(x,u) in Ω,u|∂Ω= 0, where u−=min{ 0,u}, u+=max{ 0,u}, and (a,b) ∈R 2 {{is a pair}} of parameters. We show that these two-dimensional bifurcation surfaces stem from the Fučik spectrum of −Δ. The main difficulty in <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> non-smoothness of the operators u↦u±. In order to overcome this difficulty, a variant implicit function theorem and an abstract two-dimensional bifurcation theorem are proved. These two theorems do not require smoothness of operators and the abstract two-dimensional bifurcation theorem can be regarded {{as an extension of the}} well-known Crandall–Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, and therefore are of interest for their own sake...|$|R

"Bridge over Troubled Water" [...] was {{composed}} by Paul Simon very quickly, {{so much so}} that he asked himself, [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> It doesn't seem like me." [...] The chorus lyrics were partly inspired by Claude Jeter's line [...] "I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in me," [...] which Jeter sang with his group, the Swan Silvertones, in the 1958 song [...] "Mary Don't You Weep." [...] According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut, Simon later acknowledged his musical debt to Jeter in person, and additionally handed Jeter a check as compensation. [...] Simon wrote the song initially on guitar but decided to transpose it to the piano, to both better reflect the gospel influence and to suit Garfunkel's voice.|$|E

40|$|Visiting family {{last summer}} I was {{surprised}} to spot the amount of red, blue and gold fabric – yes, Tibetan flags – flying from the roofs of village homes in the French Alps, something of a solidarity I guess with high altitude brethren {{at the other end}} of the Eurasian expanse. A little of Tibet in France. After the Olympic torch events of last year, why not. But then that did not prepare me for reporter Edward Cody’s piece on France in today’s Washington Post. “French Workers Return to Streets in Protest” predictably reported that a million-plus French were pounding pavement to shake Sarkozy out of his cautious, unsympathetic leadership in the face of jobs hemorrhaging around the country. No surprises there. Then: “Despite the rancor on their banners, most marchers seemed cheerful in the spring weather as they marched and shouted anti-capitalist slogans. They moved past the house where Gustave Flaubert, author of “Madame Bovary,” lived in the 19 th century; they walked by the Kunga Tibetan restaurant, from where three Tibetans peered out at a raucous phenomenon that their countrymen left behind under Chinese rule were unlikely to witness any time soon; and they spilled into the Place de la Bastille, where street protesters kicked off the French Revolution in 1789 by tearing open a royal prison tower. ” Wow. Non sequitur extraordinaire. Where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> I tried to follow the train of thought: Reference French literary giant. Reference launch of French Revolution. Reference China’s stranglehold on Tibet. Huh? Talk about conditioned synapses. Maybe predict that workers in the world’s third largest economy – China – might not be commanding the streets in protest “any time soon. ” But Tibet? I guess all (mental) roads these days do lead to Lhasa...|$|E
