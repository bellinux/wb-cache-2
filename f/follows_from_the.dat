5|$|This <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal planar graph, the book {{thickness}} is two if {{and only if}} a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal planar graph is two.|$|E

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|If i < j, it <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{definition}} that s'j ≡ 1 (mod s'i). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's sequence are relatively prime. The sequence {{can be used}} to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence {{can be used to}} prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).|$|E
