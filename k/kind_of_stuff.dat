25|$|The mind–body {{problem in}} {{philosophy}} examines {{the relationship between}} mind and matter, {{and in particular the}} relationship between consciousness and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains {{that there is only one}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> and that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, and was famously addressed by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism. Descartes believed that humans only, and not other animals have this non-physical mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire.

500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse.

Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> without seeming somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin.
