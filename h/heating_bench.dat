40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{perforated}} bench {{is to reduce the}} air humidity beneath the plant canopy without excessive energy consumption. A <b>bench</b> <b>heating</b> system with heating pipes under a perforated bench with skirts creates an airflow through the bench openings due to buoyancy forces. Because the heated air is relatively dry compared to the surrounding air, it has a moisture absorbing and transporting capacity. The moisture transporting capacity will be decrease, thereby reducing the advantages of the perforated bench, if airflow rate is impeded by the bench structure, plant shape or leaf area index. Thus the airflow rate is of importance for the performance of a perforated bench. In an experimental setup the airflow rate was determined for different perforated bench designs with and without plants. Measurements were carried out with five different plant types on four bench designs. It was found that the airflow rate was effected by the design of the perforated bench, but on the same type of bench the effect of plant type and leaf area index was insignificant.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 12, 2016 - April 12, 2017 Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is a devastating pest that attacks thin-skinned stone and small fruit in all major production regions of the United States and worldwide. D. suzukii {{first appeared in the}} United States in 2008 and is believed to be native to Southeast Asia. This vinegar fly has a unique ovipositor that is serrated allowing oviposition in fully intact fruit. The larvae that emerge from the eggs damage fruit through feeding rendering them unmarketable. Typical management practices include increased pesticide applications, primarily targeting gravid females. The first objective of this research was to determine the impact of light, temperature, and forced egg retention of D. suzukii under different diurnal regimes. These regimes included cool (10 - 23 °C) and warm (12 - 27 °C) daily cycles with a 16 : 8 (light: dark), 24 h light, and 24 h dark cycles. Under all regimes, the oviposition peaked during 14 h 00 - 17 h 00. Under dark conditions, egg-laying levels were elevated compared to normal daily light regimes. Under 24 h light conditions, oviposition was reduced to virtually zero. When flies were forced to retain their eggs, oviposition occurred at elevated levels compared to treatments where there was no forced egg retention. In this treatment, oviposition started directly after the oviposition medium was offered. The second objective was to evaluate the survival of D. suzukii larvae when exposed to temperatures on a thermogradient bench ranging from 29 - 49 °C for 60 minutes. Lower temperatures resulted in the highest survival levels. At 38 - 45 °C, survival was significantly reduced to virtually zero. Four-day-old larvae were additionally exposed to ‘heat conditioning treatments’ to determine if pre-conditioning would allow increased larval survival at temperatures above 38 °C. Larval ‘heat therapy treatments’ included 30, 60, and 90 min at 35 °C. All larvae were then allowed to cool to room temperature (22 °C) for 60 mins prior to being exposed to thermogradient temperatures within a thermal <b>heat</b> <b>bench.</b> Larval survival for no heat therapy and 90 -minute heat therapy treatments (no and less optimal heat therapy) were statistically similar. Larval survival for more optimal heat therapy treatments (30 and 60 minute treatments) were statistically similar. More flies emerged in optimal heat therapy treatments compared to the less optimal and no heat therapy treatments. At 41 - 48 °C, the more optimal heat therapy treatments resulted in adult D. suzukii emergence and showed higher emergence trends compared to the no heat therapy and less optimal treatments. This research contributed to the understanding of D. suzukii oviposition behavior and ability to adapt to heat extremes as described above. This information can be incorporated into pest management strategies to reduce pesticide reliance and lead to better control methods. Knowing the heat necessary to restrict larval survival may be incorporated by increasing the heat surrounding the fruiting plant. Using black weed mat while pruning potentially could increase heat. This could be paired with adding lighting during the vulnerable growing period when D. suzukii are likely to attack. Both recommendations need to be researched in an outside growing environment before industry implantation...|$|R
40|$|The use of thermogravimetric {{analysis}} to describe biomass kinetics often uses bench top thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) analysers which are only capable of low heating rates. The {{aim of this}} research was to compare experimental fast pyrolysis of Olive kernels in a bespoke laboratory thermogravimetric fluidised bed reactor (TGFBR) characterised by rapid heating rates at high flow rates, compared to a smaller bench scale fixed bed TGA system. The pyrolysis in the TGFBR was analysed by using the isothermal kinetic approach and it was theorised that the pyrolysis decomposition reactions occurred by two mechanisms depending on the temperature, resulting in an activation energy of 67. 4 kJ/mol at temperatures below 500 °C. For comparison, a bench scale TGA was used to look at the thermal behaviour in different fixed bed thermal conditions giving a higher activation energy of 74. 4 kJ/mol due to the effect of external particle gas diffusion. The effect of biomass particle size (0. 3 – 4. 0 mm) on the conversion of biomass at different temperatures, was investigated between 300 and 660 °C in the TGFBR.

During the tests, the composition in R 170 /R 290 mixture is varied from 0 % to 10 % with an interval of 2 %. Test results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) and capacity of R 290 are up to 15. 4 % higher and 7. 5 % lower, respectively than those of R 22 for two conditions. For R 170 /R 290 mixture, the COP decreases and the capacity increases with an increase in the composition of R 170. The mixture of R 170 /R 290 mixture at 4 %/ 96 % composition shows the similar capacity and COP as those of R 22. For the mixture, the compressor discharge temperature is 17 - 28 Â Â°C lower than that of R 22.

40|$|International audienceOn {{industrial}} {{induction heating}} devices, induction coils are water cooled {{at a high}} flow rate: this {{large amount of energy}} (10 to 60 % of the total energy consumption) is often lost. A <b>heat</b> recovery test <b>bench</b> has been built to collect the coil losses and reuse them when needed. The main parts of the test bench are made up two heat exchangers which can be bypassed according to the control and regulation system. The " recovery heat exchanger " collects the heat to be recovered and transfers it to the reuse, the recovery circuit. The " waste heat exchanger " evacuates the remained energy to ensure a safe use of the induction heating device. These two exchangers are designed for a 100 kW power transfer. A " Predictive Functional Control " (PFC) regulation has been implemented to drive the bench. This system is more efficient compared to a conventional PID controller. Thanks to a precise modeling of the bench parts and the induction device, it is possible to anticipate disturbances such as induction power fluctuations and to adapt the recovering in order to always work in a safe way. It was then possible to recover 66 % of the energy lost in the coil with a water output temperature of 85 to 90 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using nanosensors to measure temperature distribution and predict thermal breakthrough in geothermal reservoirs is {{addressed in this}} report. Four candidate sensors were identified: melting tin-bismuth alloy nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles with covalently-attached dye, hollow silica nanoparticles with encapsulated dye and impermeable melting shells, and dye-polymer composite time-temperature indicators. Four main challenges associated with the successful implementation of temperature nanosensors were identified: nanoparticle mobility in porous and fractured media, the collection and detection of nanoparticles at the production well, engineering temperature sensing mechanisms that are both detectable and irreversible, and inferring the spatial geolocation of temperature measurements in order to map temperature distribution. Initial experiments were carried out to investigate each of these challenges. It was demonstrated in a slim-tube injection experiment {{that it is possible}} to transport silica nanoparticles over large distances through porous media. The {{feasibility of}} magnetic collection of nanoparticles from produced fluid was evaluated experimentally, and it was estimated that 3 % of the injected nanoparticles were recovered in a prototype magnetic collection device. An analysis technique was tailored to nanosensors with a dye-release mechanism to estimate temperature measurement geolocation by analyzing the return curve of the released dye. This technique was used in a hypothetical example problem, and good estimates of geolocation were achieved. Tin-bismuth alloy nanoparticles were synthesized using a sonochemical method, and a <b>bench</b> <b>heating</b> experiment was performed using these nanoparticles. Particle growth due to melting was observed, indicating that tin-bismuth nanoparticles have potential as temperature nanosensor...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Thermal Program at Sandia {{supports}} work developing dish/Stirling {{systems to}} convert solar energy into electricity. Heat pipe technology {{is ideal for}} transferring the energy of concentrated sunlight from the parabolic dish concentrators to the Stirling engine heat tubes. Heat pipes can absorb the solar energy at non-uniform flux distributions and release this energy to the Stirling engine heater tubes at a very uniform flux distribution thus decoupling {{the design of the}} engine heater head from the solar absorber. The most important part of a heat pipe is the wick, which transports the sodium over the <b>heated</b> surface area. <b>Bench</b> scale <b>heat</b> pipes were designed and built to more economically, both in time and money, test different wicks and cleaning procedures. This report covers the building, testing, and post-test analysis of the sixth in a series of <b>bench</b> scale <b>heat</b> pipes. Durability heat pipe No. 6 was built and tested {{to determine the effects of}} a high temperature bakeout, 950 C, on wick corrosion during long-term operation. Previous tests showed high levels of corrosion with low temperature bakeouts (650 - 700 C). Durability heat pipe No. 5 had a high temperature bakeout and reflux cleaning and showed low levels of wick corrosion after long-term operation. After testing durability heat pipe No. 6 for 5, 003 hours at an operating temperature of 750 C, it showed low levels of wick corrosion. This test shows a high temperature bakeout alone will significantly reduce wick corrosion without the need for costly and time consuming reflux cleaning...|$|R
50|$|Joseph C. Trees Pool, {{housed in}} the left wing of Trees Hall, is home of the men's and women's University of Pittsburgh Swimming and Diving teams and {{features}} a 75-by-165 foot (23-by-50 meter) Olympic-size swimming pool with a 770,000 gallon capacity. This main pool has the dual capability of an eight-lane, 50-meter course or a 20-lane 25 yd course. When completed in 1962, it was hailed as the largest indoor pool in the country. Although {{it was one of}} the last 55 yd pools constructed in the United States, it was also one of the first pools with a 10-meter high-dive tower, underwater windows, underwater sound system, and <b>heated</b> deck and <b>benches.</b> Along with the 10 meter diving platform, it also has 5 and 7 meter platforms. An additional 6-lane 25 yd pool was added in the summer of 1963. In 2002, a Daktronic scoreboard was installed and dedicated the Ben Grady, a former Pitt head swimming coach. In 2003, a Panthers' Wall of Fame was unveiled that featured plaques of every Pitt Swimming and Diving All-American as well as conference and meet championship trophies. Currently, the diving area is equipped with two one-meter and two three-meter durafirm stands with maxiflex boards, in addition to multiple diving towers with a 16 ft water depth. Trees pool is underwent a $1.92 million major renovation completed in September 2008 which includes a new bottom logo, new 1-meter diving platforms, new pool deck, new deck heating, new water heating, filtration and circulation systems, and a reduction of the pool length from 55m to 50m. Trees Pool is also the home of Team Pittsburgh youth and masters swimming program.|$|R
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system and viscera {{constitute}} a functional ensemble, the gut-brain axis, that allows bidirectional information flow {{that contributes to the}} control of feeding behavior based not only on the homeostatic, but also on the hedonic aspects of food intake. The prevalence of eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, binge eating and obesity, poses an enormous clinical burden, and involves an ever-growing percentage of the population worldwide. Clinical and preclinical research is constantly adding new information to the field and orienting further studies with the aim of providing a foundation for developing more specific and effective treatment approaches to pathological conditions. A recent symposium at the XVI Congress of the Societá Italiana di Neuroscienze (SINS, 2015) <b>'Eating</b> disorders: from <b>bench</b> to bedside and back' brought together basic scientists and clinicians with the objective of presenting novel perspectives in the neurobiology of eating disorders. Clinical studies presented by V. Ricca illustrated some genetic aspects of the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa. Preclinical studies addressed different issues ranging from the description of animal models that mimic human pathologies such as anorexia nervosa, diet-induced obesity, and binge eating disorders (T. Lutz), to novel interactions between peripheral signals and central circuits that govern food intake, mood and stress (A. Romano and G. Provensi). The gut-brain axis has received increasing attention in the recent years as preclinical studies are demonstrating that the brain and visceral organs such as the liver and guts, but also the microbiota are constantly engaged in processes of reciprocal communication, with unexpected physiological and pathological implications. Eating is controlled by a plethora of factors; genetic predisposition, early life adverse conditions, peripheral gastrointestinal hormones that act directly or indirectly on the {{central nervous system}}, all are receiving attention as they presumably {{contribute to the development of}} eating disorders...|$|R
