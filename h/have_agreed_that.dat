5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E

5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

In the 18th century, the work was even called a satire, for example by Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

25|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{something}} {{known as}} the witch hunt took place across Europe and the American colonies, during which somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people were killed. These people {{had been accused of}} being witches, who, according to their persecutors, worshipped the Devil, and committed acts of diabolism that included the cannibalism of children and desecration of the Eucharist. Most scholars since <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> these were the victims of isolated incidents of hysteria in remote, peasant communities, {{and that there was no}} religion being practised by these witches.|$|E
25|$|Loose {{medicines}} {{may not be}} carried; most authorities <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it {{is preferable}} that one who constantly needs medication remain at home rather than transgressing Shabbat by carrying medication.

A small number of authorities {{in recent years have}} been permitting carrying the medication, however, since such a person may be tempted to leave home without it, and then his/her life may be endangered thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In {{this dispute}} {{it can be}} {{inferred}} that Katznelson and, Schlesinger and Patterson, have only disagreed on their inference of the historical evidence. While both parties <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the federal government expanded and, even, that states had a degree {{of control over the}} allocation of federal funds, they have disputed the consequences of these claims. Katznelson has asserted that it created mutual acquiescence between the levels of government, while Schlesinger and Patterson have suggested that it provoked contempt for the state governments {{on the part of the}} federal government, and vice versa, thus exacerbating their relations. In short, irrespective of the interpretation this era marked an important time in the historiography of federalism and also nevertheless provided some narrative on the legacy of federal-state relations.|$|E

25|$|Herod died in Jericho. Based on {{the work}} of Emil Schürer in 1896, most {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Herod died at the end of March or early April in 4 BCE. Evidence for the 4BCE date is provided by the fact that Herod's sons, between whom his kingdom was divided, dated their rule from 4BCE, and Archelaus apparently also exercised royal authority during Herod's lifetime. Josephus states that Philip the Tetrarch's death took place after a 37-year reign, in the 20th year of Tiberius (34 CE). Other scholars have continued to support the traditional date of 1BCE. Filmer and Steinmann in particular have thought that Herod was named king by the Roman Senate in 39 BCE, but he died in 1 BCE, and Herod's heirs backdated their reigns to 4 or 3 BCE.|$|E

Moreover, an earlier start time could not be arranged because the broadcast window was fixed in advance, and both the NHL and NBC needed the flexibility to pick the Western Conference Finals for that window if they so desired.|$|E
