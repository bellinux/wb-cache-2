It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family. After the Norman conquest, the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.|$|E

With the resources of the universe allowing permanent expansion (at least assuming non-exponential growth), this frees them from having to compete for living space.|$|E

Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E

This could bring street protests and violence across the developing world.'" [...] In a speech at the U.N. Economic and Social Council, economist Jeffrey Sachs also opposed Wolfowitz: [...] "It's time for other candidates to come forward that have experience in development.

2500|$|The {{original}} edition of The Population Bomb began with this statement: [...] "The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will {{starve to death}} in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent {{a substantial increase in}} the world death rate..." [...] Ehrlich argued that the human population was too great, and that while the extent of disaster could be mitigated, humanity could not prevent severe famines, the spread of disease, social unrest, and other negative consequences of overpopulation. By the end of the 1970s, this prediction proved to be incorrect. However, he continued to argue that societies must take strong action to decrease population growth in order to mitigate future disasters, both ecological and social.|$|E
2500|$|In The Population Bomb's opening {{lines the}} authors state {{that nothing can}} prevent famines in which <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will die during the 1970s (amended to 1970s and 80s in later editions), and {{that there would be}} [...] "a {{substantial}} increase in the world death rate." [...] Although many lives could be saved through dramatic action, {{it was already too late}} to prevent a substantial increase in the global death rate. However, in reality the global death rate has continued to decline substantially since then, from 13/1000 in 1965–74 to 10/1000 from 1985–1990. Meanwhile, the population of the world has more than doubled, while calories consumed/person have increased 24%. The UN does not keep official death-by-hunger statistics so it is hard to measure whether the [...] "hundreds of millions of deaths" [...] number is correct. Ehrlich himself suggested in 2009 that between 200-300 million had died of hunger since 1968. However, that is measured over 40 years rather than the ten to twenty foreseen in the book, so it can be seen as significantly fewer than predicted.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet {{threat to}} send troops to Egypt to fight the Allies led Eisenhower to fear {{that this might be}} the {{beginning}} of World War III. One of Eisenhower's aides Emmet Hughes recalled that the reaction at the White House to the Bulganin letters was [...] "sombre" [...] as there was fear that this was the beginning to the countdown to World War III, a war that if it occurred would kill <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> In private, Eisenhower told Undersecretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr. of his fears that: [...] If the Soviet Union did go to war with NATO allies Britain and France, then the United States would be unable to remain neutral, because the United States' obligations under NATO would come into effect, requiring them {{to go to war with}} the Soviet Union in defense of Britain and France. Likewise, if the Soviet Union attacked Israel, though there was no formal American commitment to defend Israel, the Eisenhower administration would come under heavy domestic pressure to intervene. From Eisenhower's viewpoint, it was better to end the war against Egypt rather than run the risk of this escalating into the Third World War, in case Khrushchev was serious about going to war in defense of Egypt as he insisted in public that he was. Eisenhower's reaction to these threats from the Soviet Union was: [...] "If those fellows start something, we may have to hit 'em — and, if necessary, with everything in the bucket." [...] Eisenhower immediately ordered the U-2s into action over Syria and Israel to search for any Soviet air forces on Syrian bases, so the British and French could destroy them. He told Hoover and CIA director Allan Dulles, [...] "If the Soviets attack the French and British directly, we would be in a war and we would be justified in taking military action even if Congress were not in session." [...] (The Americans excluded Israel from the guarantee against Soviet attack, however, alarming the Israeli government.) ...|$|E
