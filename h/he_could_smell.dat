5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

60|$|Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to {{maintain}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> thirty, and {{the men of the}} first ship in which I sailed claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer, knew by name every wave along thirty from 60dN. to 60dS. However, I'd hate to vouch for this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember when 'e {{told us to}} walk {{in single}} file for fear o' bears? 'Remember, Pye, when 'e 'opped about in that bog full o' ferns an' sniffed an' said <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the smoke of 'is uncle's farm? An' all {{the time it was}} a dirty little out-lyin' {{uninhabited}} island. We walked round it in a day, an' come back to our boat lyin' on the beach. A whole day Boy Niven kept us walkin' in circles lookin' for 'is uncle's farm! He said his uncle was compelled by {{the law of the land}} to give us a farm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|After another half-an-hour's walking, Reuben {{thought that}} <b>he</b> too <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> an odour of burning wood and, soon afterwards, he became {{convinced}} that it was so. The ground on which they were crossing was slightly undulated and, on nearing the crest {{of one of the}} slight rises, Jim said: ...|$|R
60|$|The adit was dark; he was {{embarking on}} a rash adventure, and {{wondered}} with some misgivings what would happen before he came out again. He heard nothing, and it was rather curious that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> smoke, but bracing himself he stooped and crept into the dark hole.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund, rebuffed by {{the only}} one in the house from whom he might have {{expected}} friendship, proceeded slowly to shave, feeling sick at heart. He was a long time over his toilet. When he stripped himself for the bath, it seemed to him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the sea. He bent his head and licked his shoulder. It tasted decidedly salt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn’t ha’ minded so much if it ’adn’t ha’ {{been for}} that boy. He used to pass me, as ’e went {{off of a}} evening, with a little sly smile on ’is ugly little face, and {{sometimes}} when I {{was standing at the}} gate he’d give a sniff or two and say that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> beer, and he supposed it came from the Bear’s Head.|$|E
60|$|When Kit {{was half}} {{way across the}} alameda he stopped and looked about. Dark trees rose against the sky; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the {{eucalyptus}} and their thin shadows covered {{the ground with a}} quivering, open pattern. There was a pool of moonlight, and farther on the solid, fan-shaped reflections of palms. Nobody was near him, although he heard voices across the alameda, and he stood for a few moments, thinking, while his heart beat.|$|E
6000|$|... "See us? sartin, little sister; {{but that}} only make him want peek um some more," [...] said the little hunter. And raised {{carelessly}} on his elbows he was telling Mooka how Megaleep the caribou trusted only his nose, and how he watched and played peekaboo with anything which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell,</b> and how in a snowstorm-- ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was all}} dark to Dick. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>smell</b> the camels, the hay-bales, the cooking, {{the smoky}} fires, and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood, where he had dropped from the train, {{shouting}} for George. There was a sound of light- hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks, with squealing and grunting. George was unloading the mules.|$|R
6000|$|It {{must not}} be supposed, then, that our friend John Bax--{{sometimes}} called [...] "captain," [...] sometimes [...] "skipper," [...] not unfrequently [...] "mister," [...] but most commonly [...] "Bax," [...] without any modification--was a hopeless castaway, because he was found by his friend Guy Foster {{in a room full}} of careless foul-mouthed seamen, eating his bread and cheese and drinking his beer in an atmosphere so impregnated with tobacco smoke that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely see, and so redolent of gin that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>smell</b> the smoke! ...|$|R
60|$|Then, silently, on {{infinitely}} careful feet, he {{went along}} the passage, feeling {{the wall with}} the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a door. He stood and listened. He could hear two people's breathing. It was not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door, slightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was the bathroom, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the soap and the heat. Then at the end another bedroom--one soft breathing. This was she.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the building, George stopped to feel for a lantern which was kept {{on a shelf}} near the door. The place was very dark and pleasantly warm by contrast with the bitter frost outside, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the peppermint in the prairie hay. Familiar sounds reached him--the soft rattle of a shaking rope, the crackle of crushed straw--but they were rather more numerous than usual, and while he listened {{one or two of}} the horses began to move restlessly.|$|E
60|$|Happy Jack {{walked all}} around the old stump, and then he climbed {{up on top of}} it. There was only one doorway, and that was the little round hole through which Striped Chipmunk had entered and then come out. It was too small for Happy Jack to even get his head through, though his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, who is much smaller, could have slipped in easily. Happy Jack sniffed and sniffed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> nuts and corn and other good things. My, how good they did smell! His eyes shone greedily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we won't quarrel {{about the}} number. The {{question}} is, Why not work {{him in the}} field of foreign literature? You can't go over all their reviews and magazines, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do the <b>smelling</b> for you, if you could trust his nose. Would he know a good thing?" ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{discovery}} of gold at Sutter's Fort, Swift took a party to Bidwell's Bar in 1848 and struck it rich. A fellow miner recalls, [...] "Swift {{was one of the}} best miners I ever knew. It seems as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>smell</b> the gold. He made an immense amount of gold." [...] With his newfound wealth, Swift, his brother William, and his cousin Frank Sears first purchased the ranch they had been working, and later purchased 15,000 acres (61 km²) of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo's Rancho Petaluma, located near Sears Point.|$|R
5000|$|The fuzzy navel {{was one of}} {{the first}} drinks to arise in the new {{popularity}} of cocktails and mixed drinks in the 1980s. The drink was invented over 30 years ago by Ray Foley, a well known bartender and founder of Bartender Magazine. [...] The story goes that Ray was cutting an orange for a garnish when a man nearby made the remark that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>smell</b> the fuzz of the peach schnapps through the orange juice. Ray looked at the orange and saw the printed word [...] "Navel" [...] for navel orange. Thus the cocktail was born.|$|R
60|$|He {{clutched}} the chain {{by which the}} cone hung, and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within, flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.|$|E
60|$|Over {{in the top}} of a tall {{pine tree}} Blacky the Crow was hiding and chuckling to himself as he watched. Reddy Fox was getting impatient. He was hungry. He had had no breakfast, and as he lay hiding in the hollow log, he could peep out and see all the good things, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them, too. It seemed as if his stomach would just give him no peace at all. He wished that Sammy Jay would bring the false message that Bowser the Hound was coming, so as to frighten all the rest away.|$|E
6000|$|We soon {{passed the}} island where I had camped four years before. The deadwater, {{a mile or}} two below it, the Indian said was [...] "a great place for moose." [...] We saw the grass bent where a moose came out the night before, and the Indian said that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> one {{as far as he could}} see him, but he added that if he should see five or six to-day close by canoe he no shoot 'em. Accordingly, as he was the only one of the party who had a gun, or had come a-hunting, the moose were safe.|$|E
60|$|Smith {{found himself}} very wide awake indeed. Never {{in all his}} life did he {{remember}} being more so, {{not even in the}} hour of its great catastrophe, or when his godfather, Ebenezer, after much hesitation, had promised him a clerkship in the bank of which he was a director. His nerves seemed strung tight as harp-strings, and his every sense was painfully acute. Thus <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>smell</b> the odour of mummies that floated down from the upper galleries and the earthy scent of the boat which had been buried for thousands of years in sand {{at the foot of the}} pyramid of one of the fifth dynasty kings.|$|R
5000|$|On January 9, 2008, federal marshals came to Jacks' home {{to serve}} her with eviction. Jacks {{came to the}} door wearing only a white T-shirt and refused to allow them inside. The marshals forced their way past the door, and marshal Nicholas Garrett said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{immediately}} <b>smell</b> an odor of [...] "rotting meat, like stink bait" [...] which he thought was [...] "rotten or spoiled food." [...] In an upstairs bedroom, they found the bodies of the three younger girls, lined up according to age, each wearing a white T-shirt. The body of Brittany Jacks was in another upstairs bedroom, nude and lying on the floor in a pool of blood, underneath a white T-shirt.|$|R
60|$|To his surprise, {{however, the}} young girl, {{following}} {{the path to}} the lilacs, began leisurely to ascend the hill, swaying from side to side with a youthful movement, and swinging the long stalk of a lily at her side. In another moment he would be discovered! Dick was frightened; his confidence of the moment before had all gone; he would fly,--and yet, an exquisite and fearful joy kept him motionless. She was approaching him, full and clear in the moonlight. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see the grace of her delicate figure in the simple white frock drawn at the waist with broad satin ribbon, and its love-knots of pale blue ribbons on her shoulders; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see the coils of her brown hair, the pale, olive tint of her oval cheek, the delicate, swelling nostril of her straight, clear-cut nose; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>smell</b> the lily she carried in her little hand. Then, suddenly, she lifted her long lashes, and her large gray eyes met his.|$|R
60|$|He slowly {{ventured into}} the pond. The bottom was deep, soft clay, he sank in, and the water clasped dead cold round his legs. As he stirred <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the cold, rotten clay that fouled up into the water. It was {{objectionable}} in his lungs. Still, repelled and yet not heeding, he moved deeper into the pond. The cold water rose over his thighs, over his loins, upon his abdomen. The lower {{part of his body}} was all sunk in the hideous cold element. And the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain, he was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath. He could not swim, and was afraid.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps, in Jerry's brain, {{the rising}} into the {{foreground}} of consciousness {{of an image}} of a log awash connoted more intimate and fuller comprehension of the thing being thought about, than did the word [...] "crocodile," [...] and its accompanying image, in the foreground of a human's consciousness. For Jerry really did know more about crocodiles than the average human. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> a crocodile farther off and more differentiatingly than could any man, than could even a salt-water black or a bushman smell one. He could tell when a crocodile, hauled up from the lagoon, lay without sound or movement, and perhaps asleep, a hundred feet away on the floor mat of jungle.|$|E
60|$|A {{bunch of}} flowers stood upon the table; and their scent {{mingled with the}} faint smell of decay that hung about the room. Lying still, Dick heard the leather curtain rustle softly in the draught, muffled sounds of traffic, and the drowsy murmur of the surf. Its rhythmic beat was {{soothing}} and he thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the sea. By and by he made an abrupt move that hurt him as a voice floated into the room. It was singularly clear and sweet, {{and he thought he}} knew it, as he seemed to know the song, but could not catch the words and the singing stopped. Then light footsteps passed the arch and there was silence again.|$|E
5000|$|Soapy Jennings (Dave Wittenberg) - A safe cracker and {{a friend}} of Colton. Soapy's two {{specialties}} are cracking safes and cheating at poker, two major moral strikes against him in the Old West. During the ride to Piper Lake from the Badlands, he confides to Cole the origin of his nickname: he was cornered in a lady friend's bedroom by her husband, and was forced to hide inside the shaft of her water closet - after which he had to scrub for three days before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get the <b>smell</b> off of him.|$|R
60|$|When, {{feeling very}} dizzy, Breckenridge raised {{himself in the}} corner {{where he had been}} lying, the hall was empty save for two huddled figures in the doorway, and while he blinked at them in a half-dazed fashion, {{it seemed to him that}} a red glare, which rose and fell, shone in. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also <b>smell</b> burning wood, and saw dim wreaths of smoke drive by outside. His hearing was not {{especially}} acute just then, but he fancied that men were trampling, and apparently dragging furniture about, all over the building. Then, as his scattered senses came back to him, he rose feebly to his feet, and finding to his astonishment that he still possessed the power of locomotion, walked unevenly towards the motionless objects in the doorway. One of them, as he expected, was Grant, who was lying very white and still, just as he had fallen.|$|R
5000|$|The surgery did {{restore some}} of Shirl Jenning's vision. However, he was {{overwhelmed}} with visual sensory data and {{was unable to}} connect what he was seeing with his visual memory, which had all but disappeared. The family contacted Dr. Oliver Sacks, a famous neurologist known for his book Awakenings, who, along with other physicians, concluded that Shirl would need to relearn how to identify objects that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feel and <b>smell</b> by using their visual cues. Shirl's extraordinary metamorphosis was featured in a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, [...] "To See and Not See," [...] by Dr. Sacks.|$|R
60|$|Seating {{herself in}} the grass, she began to pull daisies, singing idly the while, as if {{unconscious}} of the spirited prancings of the horse. Presently he drew nearer, sniffing curiously and eyeing her with surprise. She took no notice, but plaited the daisies and sang on {{as if he was}} not there. This seemed to pique the petted creature, for, slowly approaching, he came at length so close that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> her little foot and nibble at her dress. Then she offered the clover, uttering caressing words and making soothing sounds, till by degrees and with much coquetting, the horse permitted her to stroke his glossy neck and smooth his mane.|$|E
60|$|Inside {{the hollow}} log Reddy Fox was getting stiff and sore, because, you know, he didn't have room enough to even turn over. Worse still, {{he was so}} hungry that he could cry. You see, he had crept in there {{very early in the}} morning without any breakfast, because he had planned that when Sammy Jay should break up Peter Rabbit's party, he would steal all the good things he wanted. Now, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them, and hear the others talking about the feast they were going to have, and he knew that {{not so much as a}} tiny, tiny crumb would be left for him, when Prickly Porky should choose to let him out.|$|E
60|$|Bagheera {{sprang to}} his feet, thrust up {{his head as}} far as he could, sniffed, and {{stiffened}} through every curve in his body. Gray Brother followed his example quickly, keeping a little to his left to get the wind that was blowing from the right, while Akela bounded fifty yards up wind, and, half-crouching, stiffened too. Mowgli looked on enviously. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> things as very few human beings could, but he had never reached the hair-trigger-like sensitiveness of a Jungle nose; and his three months in the smoky village had set him back sadly. However, he dampened his finger, rubbed it on his nose, and stood erect to catch the upper scent, which, though it is the faintest, is the truest.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{a magical}} dog, Jake has an acute sense of smell, {{as he can}} {{apparently}} smell the precise location of an object miles away. In [...] "The Chamber of Frozen Blades" [...] he stated that his sense of smell is [...] "1,000 times better" [...] than Finn's, although compared to normal dogs this is a low estimate, suggesting that he was either just guessing, or his sense of smell {{is similar to that}} of an average dog. He also claimed in [...] "The Enchiridion" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not only <b>smell</b> the book, but also that it was in a room inside of a castle.|$|R
60|$|The exact {{locality}} of {{the fire}} was plain {{to him as he}} neared home. <b>He</b> soon <b>could</b> hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of burning wood, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the smoke from the conflagration.|$|R
60|$|Alf's rigorously limited {{powers of}} comprehending Torpenhow"s special {{correspondence}} had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> hear, through the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside Suakin; {{could hear the}} men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the acrid wood-smoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.|$|R
