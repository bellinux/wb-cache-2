5|$|As the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives, the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can cause the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives to reconsider its decision. The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords Bill into the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons passed the bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords.|$|E

5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives and the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers. Members of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Tudor (20 September 1486– 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall.

5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons and the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E

40|$|<b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> worship {{constitute}} valuable landmarks in {{the built}} environment; {{they represent the}} power of faith and mankind, {{in the form of}} durable buildings designed to stand the test <b>of</b> time. Nevertheless, <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> worship are becoming redundant as a result of endogenous factors, such as maintenance or lack of funding, and exogenous factors, often related to suburbanization and demographic changes. As a consequence, many <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> worship are suffering a process of decay, which calls for adaptive reuse as a necessary response. While the adaptive reuse <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> worship is becoming a common practice, current practices do not prioritize the comprehensive preservation of the character-defining features. Specifically, traditional preservation approaches do not take into consideration the relevance of the sensory perception of the space as a determinant in the preservation of the character and significance of the place.
