5000|$|In 1971, the Bruins {{finished}} {{first in the}} League with Esposito and Orr shattering scoring records, but they lost {{in the first round}} to the Canadiens, who {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup, in seven games. Late in the 1970-71 regular season, Montreal traded for veteran Frank Mahovlich and called up rookie goaltender Ken Dryden; the Bruins had not faced Dryden in the last two regular season meetings with the Habs and he would become a surprise playoff starter who made miraculous saves on the Bruins. Notably in Game 2, the Bruins blew a 5-1 lead and lost 7-5. Bobby Orr had a hat-trick at the Forum in Game 4 to even the series. The Bruins dominated 7-3 in Game 5, but the Habs responded with an 8-3 victory in Game 6 and a 4-2 win in Game 7 to knock out the heavily favoured Bruins. Sportswriter Cam Cole wrote of the series, [...] "Where the whole world stopped for the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens in the spring of 1971, and my heart was crushed by the evil Habs. If I didn’t actually cry, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> <b>hell</b> felt like it. It seemed at least unfair, and possibly illegal, that anyone should be able to stop as magnificent a creature as Bobby Orr—let alone Phil Esposito and Johnny Bucyk and the rest—with some college-boy goalie Dryden." [...] Cole opioned [...] "there is no scale to measure the visceral abhorrence I harboured for the Canadiens, how badly I wanted Orr to win in '71."http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Bobby+Great/8128247/story.html This ended a potential Bruins dynasty, though the Bruins would win the Stanley Cup the following year against the New York Rangers, who had earlier knocked out the Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs.|$|E
