5|$|Kaali's {{most common}} four armed {{iconographic}} image shows <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> carrying variously a sword, a trishul (trident), a severed head, {{and a bowl}} or skull-cup (kapala) catching {{the blood of the}} severed head.|$|E
5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player could use two mallets, one in <b>each</b> <b>hand.</b> An even more {{interesting}} technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with <b>each</b> <b>hand.</b> To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
50|$|Leicester Riders guard, {{and former}} Los Angeles Lakers star Steve Bucknall, {{as well as}} Guildford star Chad McKnight both test {{positive}} for marijuana and are <b>each</b> <b>handed</b> a three-month suspension. However, the story only comes to public attention several months later.|$|R
5000|$|Tari Piring is a {{traditional}} Minangkabau plate dance of from West Sumatra, Indonesia. The dance might be performed {{by a group of}} women, men or couples, each of them holds plates in <b>each</b> <b>hands,</b> and vigorously rotate or half rotate them in various formations and fast movements.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hold'em" [...] {{refers to}} a game using {{community}} cards that are shared by all players. This is opposed to Draw games where <b>each</b> player's <b>hand</b> is composed only by hole cards and Stud games where <b>each</b> player <b>hand</b> contains both non-community cards that are visible to the other players and concealed hole cards.|$|R
5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

25|$|In mid March 2008, {{the three}} former police {{officers}} were sentenced to prison for the actual act of murder of Gongadze. Mykola Protasov was given a sentence of 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych were <b>each</b> <b>handed</b> 12-year terms. But so far the investigations have failed to show who ordered the murder.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, IRA volunteers Paul Kavanagh and Thomas Quigley, {{both from}} Belfast, {{were convicted of}} his murder (along with other attacks {{including}} the Chelsea Barracks nail bomb in September 1981) and <b>each</b> <b>handed</b> five life sentences with a minimum tariff of thirty-five years. They were released in 1999 {{under the terms of}} the Good Friday Agreement.|$|R
5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on <b>each</b> <b>hand</b> and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E
50|$|Three players: The dealer places three cards face-up on {{the table}} then deals four cards to <b>each</b> player's <b>hand,</b> {{starting}} with the player {{to the right and}} continuing counterclockwise. Then, the dealer places another three cards face-up {{on the table}} and deals another three cards to <b>each</b> player's <b>hand,</b> again starting with the player on the right.|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on <b>each</b> <b>hand.</b> Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the second digit of the hand is the largest, even when the third digit is not present.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of the blessing, the hands of the Kohanim are spread out over the congregation, with the fingers of both hands {{separated}} so as to make five spaces between them; the spaces are (1) between the ring finger and middle finger of <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> (2) between the index finger and thumb of <b>each</b> <b>hand,</b> and (3) the two thumbs touch each other at the knuckle and the aperture is the space above or below the touching knuckles.|$|E

5000|$|The stringing/tuning {{configuration}} of the Chapman Stick is advantageous to the player who wishes to play large, fully voiced chords with close inner-note relationships. In contrast to a standard guitar, where one tends to [...] "run out of options" [...] within a particular fingering, the Stick tuning results in up to 4 or even 5 octaves of note choices under <b>each</b> <b>hand's</b> fretting position.|$|R
