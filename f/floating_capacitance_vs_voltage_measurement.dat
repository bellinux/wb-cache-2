For what concerns organic contamination, MOS-DLTS showed the most significant effects from the point-of-view of the intrinsic properties of the silicon oxide - silicon interface, and GOI tests demonstrate a clear impact of the organic contamination on MOS capacitors oxi de breakdown events...|$|R

40|$|SBV (Single Barrier Varactor) diodes {{have been}} {{proposed}} as alternatives to Schottky barrier diodes for harmonic multiplier applications. However, these show a higher current than expected. The excess current is due to X valley transport in the barrier. We present experimental results showing {{that the use of}} a superlattice barrier and doping spikes in the GaAs depletion regions {{on either side of the}} barrier can reduce the excess current and improve the control of the <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristic. The experimental results consist of data taken from two types of device structures. The first test structure was used to study the performance of AlAs/GaAs superlattice barriers. The wafer was fabricated into 90 micron diameter mesa diodes and the resulting current <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristics were measured. A 10 period superlattice structure with a total thickness of approximately 400 A worked well as an electron barrier. The structure had a current density of about one A/sq cm at one volt at room temperature. The capacitance variation of these structures was small because of the design of the GaAs cladding layers. The second test structure was used to study cladding layer designs. These wafers were InGaAs and InAlAs layers lattice matched to an InP substrate. The layers have n(+) doping spikes near the barrier to increase the zero bias capacitance and control the shape of the <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristic. These structures have a capacitance ratio of 5 : 1 and an abrupt change from maximum to minimum capacitance. The measurements were made at 80 K. Based on the information obtained from these two structures, we have designed a structure that combines the low current density barrier with the improved cladding layers.

The capacitance of the 20 / 80 (Zr/Ti) composition PNZT capacitor changes by 29 % for a temperature change from 10 °C to 100 °C, which translates to 0. 32 %/°C temperature sensitivity.

The film thicknesses were varied from 150 nm to 380 nm. The films were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The XRD results on the film indicated a cubic crystalline structure (111) for the nano-CdTe particles. The band gap of the nano-particles were evaluated to be 2. 1 eV in solution and 2 eV in films, which was further confirmed by the PL measurements as the solution exhibited a yellow luminescence while the film exhibited orange luminescence.

40|$|Modern ULSI {{technology}} is currently pushing {{the limits of}} metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET) gate dielectric stability by requiring thicknesses {{on the order of}} only a few tens of angstroms. At this thickness, even small levels of contamination may lead to undesirable or fatal device characteristics. Common techniques for detecting the effects of contaminants on MOSFET devices use, for example, gate oxide integrity (GOI) and <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> (C-V) curves methods. Such methods, however, lack the spatial resolution required to characterize the effects of an isolated contaminant. Imaging techniques with high lateral resolution such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Capacitance Microscopy (SCM) offer some information about both the local presence and effect of contaminating materials. Additionally, a new technique called Tunneling Atomic Force Microscopy (TAFM) has been developed to locally map and characterize the electric properties of thin oxides in order to study how contaminants interact with the oxide. This technique uses an AFM with a conducting tip to place a localized tip-sample bias across the oxide, causing quantum mechanical electron tunneling. The TAFM {{can be used in a}} constant current or constant voltage mode, yielding complementary information about the local electronic properties of the features in the oxide film. Also, by fixing the position of the tip above the feature and ramping the bias, one obtains an I-V curve that can be analyzed using metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) theory.

It can be very costly to create on silicon a newly developed circuit, especially if it is not very manufacturable or poorly designed. To eliminate risk it is of utmost importance that circuit simulation be done correctly {{in the early stages of}} development. Simulation can only be as good as the model being used. Almost all designers whether digital, analogue, or mixed mode use SPICE to simulate their circuits. SPICE accuracy is inherently dependent on the discrete element models being used, i. e. transistors, diodes, mosfets. Development of models usually includes physical measurements, SPICE parameter extraction from the measurement data, and then SPICE simulation to verify the extracted model parameters. This can be a tedious and time consuming process. To speed up this process as well as make it much easier to accomplish, a computer program has been written to aid in the extraction of SPICE parameters for bipolar transistors. To use the program all that is needed is Gummel-Poon data, collector current <b>vs</b> collector-emitter bias <b>voltage</b> data, junction <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs</b> <b>voltage</b> data, and Ft vs collector current data.

40|$|The {{transport}} of mobile sodium ions to the Si-SiO 2 interface in a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor causes gross distortions of the capacitance-volt-age characteristics. While these changes might {{be interpreted as}} increased surface-state densities, this paper shows experimentally that the surface-state densities are unchanged by mobile ion concentrations n the 1012 /cm 2 range. By comparison of high- and low-frequency <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> measurements and conductance <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> measurements, it is shown that the distortion of C-V curves {{can be explained by}} fluctuations imposed on the surface potential by a nonuniform pileup of sodium ions at the Si-SiO 2 interface. This argument is further supported by a theoretical reproduction of the experimental C-V curves obtained by a statistical summation of ideal curves. Although the theoretical nature of the voltage de-pendence of capacitance in metal-oxide-sil icon (MOS) structures is well-understood, experimental measure-ments generally show significant deviations from the ideal curves. In addition to flatband voltage shifts caused by fixed charge in the oxide and metal contact potentials, deviations from the ideal capacitance struc-ture in the depletion domain have been ascribed to surface states, Nss, at the Si-SiO 2 interface (1). We have observed a change of structure in the capacitance-voltage (C-V) structure when sodium impurities, in-troduced during device fabrication, are driven to the Si-SiO 2 interface. Related measurements, however, indicate no change in the surface-state density with changes in location of ionized impurities in the oxide. These changes in the capacitance structure are reversi-ble and appear to be caused by potential variations due to a nonuniform distribution of sodium at the Si-SiO 2 interface. This physical hypothesis was studied by comparing quasi-static and high frequency surface-state measure-ments with conductance measurements. These com-parisons have allowed us to distinguish between dis-tortion caused by charge inhomogeneities introduced by sodium ions near the interface and distortions caused by carrier trapping sites (fast surface states) which might have been introduced by drifted sodium...|$|R
40|$|Understanding charged {{defects in}} high {{dielectric}} constant insulators {{is a critical}} challenge for advanced devices.

We find that the thermal budget during oxidation {{and the type of}} oxidizing agent (slow vs. fast) affect the amount of fixed charge in the film significantly. Oxidation of 0. 8 nm of Zr metal on Si at 600 °C in N 2 O for 15 s results in EOT= 1. 2 nm and a shift in the flatband voltage by ~- 0. 2 V indicating generation of positive fixed charge. Oxidation of similar films for 300 s result in EOT= 2. 8 nm and shift of the flatband voltage by ~- 0. 95 V. Hf films oxidized in N 2 O also show increased concentrations of fixed charge for longer oxidation times. By comparison, Si oxidized in the same environment does not show this extent of flatband voltage shift. A significantly reduced charge generation rate is observed for Hf oxidation under low O 2 partial pressure. Extended oxidations (up to 1 h) result in increased EOT and a slight decrease in the charged defect state density. Forming Gas Anneal (FGA) results in partial neutralization of the charge. FGA after the Al gate deposition also leads to significant decrease of the EOT (from 2. 7 to 2. 1 nm) indicating significant reaction of the film with the gate metal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for thin films indicates formation of Zr and Hf-silicates. However, for thick Hf films the low O 2 oxidation process results in less silicon incorporation in the film as compared to films oxidized in N 2 O.

When Cu is added, the current-density (J) <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> measurements performed in a reverse-to-forward voltage direction will yield higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), up to 10 mV, and smaller short-circuit current density (Jsc), by up to 2 mA/cm 2, relative to scanning voltage in a forward-to-reverse direction. The variation at the maximum power point, Pmax, is however small. The resulting variation in FF can be as large as 3 %. When Cu is not added, hysteresis in both Voc and Jsc is negligible however Pmax hysteresis is considerably greater. This behavior corroborates observed changes in depletion width, Wd, derived from <b>capacitance</b> (C) <b>vs</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> scans. Measured values of Wd are always smaller in reverse-to-forward voltage scans, and conversely, larger in the forward-to-reverse voltage direction.

Radiation cancer therapy {{is one of}} the most important methods of cancer treatment. The goal of radiation therapy is to apply maximum amount of dose to the tumor region while applying minimum amount of dose to the normal tissues. Being able to measure radiation dose accurately is critical for radiation therapy because it will make sure the radiation is properly delivered to the tumor region as planned. In this dissertation, the development of a passive wireless radiation dosimeter for radiation cancer therapy based on fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology was presented through the following steps. In Chapter 1, the radiation cancer therapy and existing dosimetry technology was introduced. Because of the high demand of modern radiation therapy and the deficiency of existing dosimetry. An ultra-small, passive radiation dosimeter will greatly help the dose verification in today’s radiation therapy. In Chapter 2, the building block of proposed dosimeter technology, FDSOI technology, was introduced and cutting edge development of FDSOI dosimeter was summarized. In Chapter 3, the radiation response of FDSOI metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) over a wide range of therapeutic X-ray beam energies, angles, dose ranges and applied substrate voltages were characterized. The charge collection efficiency was calculated from both technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation and an analytical model to evaluate the radiation effect quantitatively. Based upon the experimental results, the design of passive wireless sensors using FDSOI varactors was proposed. In Chapter 4, the fabrication process of FDSOI varactors was developed at University of Minnesota. <b>Capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> (CV), current <b>vs.</b> <b>voltage</b> (IV), and TCAD modeling were used to fully understand the device characterization. The capacitance based sensing of Cobalt- 60 (Co- 60) gamma radiation was demonstrated using FDSOI varactors. An analytical model was developed to further understand the device response under irradiation. Based on the analytical model, the optimal working condition at different frequencies was discussed and a guide line of improving the device sensitivity was provided. TCAD simulation was also conducted to optimize the design space of FDSOI varactors for wireless sensing. In Chapter 5. 120 -finger varactors with 0 <b>V</b> threshold <b>voltage</b> were fabricated using electron beam lithography with small device variability. An impedance measurement setup was built in clinical environment.

The future development towards more reliable dosimeter with smaller sized was proposed.

40|$|Non-invasive {{surgery is}} an {{increasing}} requirement in modern day surgical theatres. A patient’s recovery experience, and even their long term quality of life, can {{be affected by the}} amount of extensive invasion required in surgery. This issue is particularly prevalent in Cancer based surgical wards, where the removal of all cancer afflicted cells from a human body is critical to success. The difficulties associated with achieving this task are numerous: Identification of the correct cells for removal, removal of afflicted tissue that ensures complete cancer cell absence in the patient, non-excessive removal of tissue to improve the patient’s quality of life and recovery time after surgery. In an attempt to address these problems, Lymphoscintigraphy was developed to locate afflicted cells prior to surgical removal. Lymphoscintigraphy provides the surgeon with a map illustrating the location of afflicted cells throughout a patients’ body. This allows the surgeon to plan the most minimally invasive procedure whilst still acquiring the maximum afflicted tissue possible. The timeframe between a Lymphoscintigraphic scan and surgery however means that cancer cells can develop and spread further throughout the patient’s body. In short, a more immediate time frame between detection and removal of cancer cells is required to ensure surgical success. An intraoperative Lymphoscintigraphy device needs to be developed that caters for the needs of the Radio-guided surgical theatre, a fast radionuclide detection response time, highly accurate physical localisation of the emission source point, adjustable and Active Collimation to allow for wide to narrow detection windows in performing this localisation, the capacity to resolve the isotopes commonly preferred for implementation in the medical theatre. CMRP has developed in the last decade an innovative solution to cope with the requirements of an intraoperative probe: the Liana Dual Detection Probe (DDP). The focus of this study is the characterisation of detectors with their related electronics for the purpose of further development to the DDP. Though Liana is intended as a medically based instrument, it is not limited to medically based functions. Liana’s wide to narrow digital Active Collimation will be explored using characterisation from a pure physics perspective. The results of the exploration are then addressed back to the requirements of the medical theatre. Characterisation of the Liana probe provided significant physical insight into the fundamentals of detector operation. Characterisation of the probes energy and localisation resolution explored effects such as Compton induced Background Scattering events and Penumbra. IV (Current <b>vs</b> <b>Voltage)</b> and CV (<b>Capacitance</b> <b>vs</b> <b>Voltage)</b> characteristics of the photodiode investigated the dependence of the wavelength absorption region upon the impurities present within the diode. The impact of an electronics design change from a previous study by Bradley Franks was assessed to identify improvements in managing the physical phenomena occurring within the detector. These unique facets illustrated how the design of a dual detector must account for the physical phenomena associated with the interactions of energy emissions with matter...|$|R

An implant activation anneal was developed {{for the formation of}} the source and drain (S/D) of the inversionmode MOSFET. Fabricated inversion-mode devices were used as test vehicles to investigate the impact of forming gas annealing (FGA) on device performance. Following FGA, the devices exhibited a subthreshold swing (SS) of 150 mV/dec., an ION/IOFF of 104 and the transconductance, drive current and peak effective mobility increased by 29 %, 25 % and 15 %, respectively. An alternative technique, based on the fitting of the measured full-gate <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs</b> gate <b>voltage</b> using a selfconsistent Poisson-Schrödinger solver, was developed to extract the trap energy profile across the full In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As bandgap and beyond. A multi-frequency inversion-charge pumping approach was proposed to (1) study the traps located at energy levels aligned with the In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As conduction band and (2) separate the trapped charge and mobile charge contributions. The analysis revealed an effective mobility (μeff) peaking at ~ 2850 cm 2 /V. s for an inversion-charge density (Ninv) = 7 * 1011 cm 2 and rapidly decreasing to ~ 600 cm 2 /V. s for Ninv = 1 * 1013 cm 2, consistent with a μeff limited by surface roughness scattering. Atomic force microscopy measurements confirmed a large surface roughness of 1. 95 ± 0. 28 nm on the In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As channel caused by the S/D activation anneal. In order to circumvent the issue relative to S/D formation, a junctionless In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As device was developed. A digital etch was used to thin the In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As channel and investigate the impact of channel thickness (tInGaAs) on device performance. Scaling of the SS with tInGaAs was observed for tInGaAs going from 24 to 16 nm, yielding a SS of 115 mV/dec. for tInGaAs = 16 nm. Flat-band μeff values of 2130 and 1975 cm 2 /V. s were extracted on devices with tInGaAs of 24 and 20 nm, respectivel...|$|R
