In May 2013 the BLS reported a mean average <b>hourly</b> <b>pay</b> of from $12.21 (bottom 10%) to $28.66 per hour (top 10%). In March 2014, Payscale.com published that the entry-level truck driver ranged from $11.82 to $20.22 {{an hour and}} the average hourly rate was reported as $15.53 an hour. Certain special industry driving jobs such as oilfield services like vacuum, dry bulk, and winch truck drivers, can receive a $22.00 or higher hourly wage.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study showed}} that if a white woman in an all-male {{workplace}} moved to an all-female workplace, she would lose 7% of her wages. If a black woman did the same thing, she would lose 19% of her wages. Another study calculated that if female-dominated jobs did not pay lower wages, women's median <b>hourly</b> <b>pay</b> nationwide would go up 13.2% (men's pay would go up 1.1%, due to raises for men working in [...] "women's jobs").|$|E
25|$|Higher pay for {{overtime}} hours {{can reduce}} or negate {{the effect of}} a backward bending labour supply curve, by increasing wages only for hours worked beyond a certain amount. Overtime maintains the substitution effect at a high labour supply. However, the income effect from the wages increasing on all the previous hours worked is eliminated. Thus, higher <b>hourly</b> overtime <b>pay</b> can cause workers to work more hours than if the higher rate is paid on all hours.|$|R
40|$|What {{happens when}} a firm {{switches}} from <b>paying</b> <b>hourly</b> wages to <b>paying</b> piece rates? The theory developed below predicts that average productivity rises, that the firm will attract a more able work force and that the variance in output across individuals at the firm will rise as well. The theory is tested with data from a large autoglass company that changed compensation structures between 1994 and 1995. All theoretical predictions are borne out. In the firm examined, the productivity effects are extremely large, amounting to anywhere from about 20 % to 36 % of output, depending on what is held constant. About half of the worker-specific increase in productivity is passed on to workers {{in the form of}} higher wages. ...|$|R

It may be optimal for the parties to work 'long hours' remunerated at premium rates for guaranteed overtime hours. Based on British plant and machine operatives, we test three predictions. First, trained workers with longer job tenure are more likely to work overtime. Second, <b>hourly</b> overtime <b>pay</b> exceeds the value of marginal product while the basic hourly wage is less than the value of marginal product. Third, the basic hourly wage is negatively related to the overtime premium...|$|R
25|$|The manner {{by which}} wages are {{determined}} can also vary greatly between detasseling contractors. Some <b>pay</b> a straight <b>hourly</b> wage, others <b>pay</b> {{on a piece}} rates basis where detasselers are paid an amount for every row, panel or acre detasseled.

40|$|Low pay {{is usually}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} <b>hourly</b> rates of <b>pay.</b> But from a worker’s point of view low pay is most directly experienced as inadequate when it is too low over the week, the month or the year. Causes of low pay can be seen to include insufficient hours of part-time work (underemployment) or irregular schedules that lead to intervals of joblessness. We look at the case of cleaners from the contract or commercial cleaning industry, using ABS data, documents and other secondary literature, as well as a program of interviews with cleaners and cleaning managers. We argue that cleaning work is characterised by low pay, short hours and high workloads. This unfortunate combination of job characteristics is anchored {{in the structure of the}} industry, the strategies of property owners, property tenants and cleaning companies, and the deficiencies of current systems of labour regulation and social security.

40|$|SUMMARY. In many {{individual}} monetary incentive systems work-ers {{receive an}} <b>hourly</b> base <b>pay</b> and can earn incentives when produc-tivity exceeds a specified standard. The total amount {{that can be}} earned in incentives is often expressed {{as a percentage of}} base pay. This study examined the effects of different percentages of incentive pay to base pay on work productivity. Seventy-five college students were {{randomly assigned to one of}} five incentivebase pay condi-tions: 0 % (no incentives), lo%, 30 %. 60 % or 100 %. Subjects par-ticipated in 15 forty-five minute sessions during which they assem: bled parts made from bolts, nuts and washers. Subjects received a base pay amount for assembling a minimum of 50 quality parts per session and a per piece incentive for parts over 50. If subjects assern-bled 120 quality parts, the production maximum, the total amount they could earn in incentives equaled 0 %, lo%, 30 %, 60 % or 100 % of their base pay. Results indicated that the productivity of subject...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} regarding {{the status of}} photography as a fine arts medium that {{is reflected in the}} unwillingness of some nude models for other fine art media to also pose for photography. The experience of nude modeling for an amateur photographer is different from that of posing for figure drawing/painting.

40|$|I {{model and}} empirically test the {{hypothesis}} that higher-quality workers prefer performance pay to time-rate based pay because they realize rent upon two different dimensions: Explicit and implicit rents. First, higher-quality workers are outright more productive than their lower-quality counterparts, earning them explicit rent (Curme and Stefanec, 2007). Second, these same factors of production facilitate the unobserved heterogeneity for incentive workers, earning them implicit rent because they can produce a given level of output with less effort. I find strong empirical evidence to confirm that these implicit rents exist and I measure them at 1. 5 - 3. 4 percent of average real <b>hourly</b> earnings.

30|$|Next, we {{compared}} the actual monthly pay across the four cities. Table  2 lists the starting, median, and maximum salaries (in U.S. dollars) for an early childhood teacher with a bachelor's degree or the equivalent, {{as well as the}} number of working hours per week and the subsequent <b>hourly</b> median <b>pay</b> for that teacher. Examination of Table  2 reveals a slightly different picture of the ECE landscape in these cities. In terms of base salaries, early childhood teachers in Hong Kong appear to be the most generously compensated for their work. But {{it is very important to}} note that this is a single-salary pay, which has no allowance, incentives, and benefits, except for Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF), the compulsory retirement saving contributed by employers (See Additional file 1). By contrast, Chinese early childhood teachers in Singapore appear to be the most poorly compensated for their work, earning the least amount of money for their work and having one of the longest work weeks, resulting in an hourly median salary of 8.57 U.S. dollars. The salaries of the other two cities - Shenzhen and Taipei - range between Singapore and Hong Kong.|$|R
30|$|The results {{reported}} used the base wage. However, institutions and market forces may have distinct {{effects on the}} different components of the total wage. We checked if the trends in wage inequality were robust to different wage definitions by using measures of total wages (base wages + other regular monthly payments + overtime <b>pay),</b> <b>hourly</b> base wages, and hourly total wages. The conclusions did not change with the inclusion of other wage components or the explicit consideration of hours. For {{the remainder of the}} paper, we stick with base wages, which are more prone to be influenced by institutional arrangements. Therefore, the estimated measures can be interpreted as upper bounds on the role of non-market forces on the evolution of inequality.|$|R
