50|$|How many trees {{per unit}} area (spacing) that should be planted is not an easily {{answered}} question. Establishment density targets or regeneration standards have commonly been based on traditional practice, with the implicit aim of getting the stand quickly to the <b>free-to-grow</b> stage. Money is wasted if more trees are planted than are needed to achieve desired stocking rates, {{and the chance to}} establish other plantations is proportionately diminished. Ingress (natural regeneration) on a site is difficult to predict and often becomes surprisingly evident only some years after planting has been carried out. Early stand development after harvesting or other disturbance undoubtedly varies greatly among sites, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of agricultural lands to forests has increased worldwide {{over the past}} few decades for multiple reasons including increasing forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. However, previous land cover and competing vegetation often impede afforestation. We established 219 plots in 29 Quercus plantations on four previous land cover types (LCT) : Clover, Soybeans, Woody Brush, and Herbaceous Weeds. Plantations were located in Illinois, USA and were sampled 15 – 18 years after planting. Sampling data for all trees (planted and volunteer) included species, diameter, and vine presence on the main bole of the tree. <b>Free-to-grow</b> status was recorded for all Quercus species and estimated cover of two invasive species, Elaeagnus umbellata and Lonicera japonica, was documented on each plot. There was a strong relationship between total tree density and invasive species cover across all sites. Stocking success was lower and E. umbellata cover was higher on Woody Brush sites compared to Clover and Soybean cover types. Additionally, significantly more <b>free-to-grow</b> Quercus saplings occurred in Clover and Soybean cover types compared to the Woody Brush sites. The results indicate that previous land cover plays a critical role in forest afforestation. Furthermore, while historically, volunteer tree species were thought to be detrimental to the development of planted species these results suggest that with the increasing prevalence of invasive species worldwide the role of volunteer species in afforestation should be reconsidered and silvicultural protocols adjusted accordingly...|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Joshua B. Nickelson, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} Forestry, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale TITLE: EVALUATING THE SUCCESS OF OAK AFFORESTATION ON FORMER AGRICULTURAL FIELDS IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS Major Professor: Dr. Eric Holzmueller The {{establishment}} of oak (Quercus spp.) plantations has {{increased over the}} past two to three decades to reduce fragmentation and promote wildlife habitat throughout the Midwestern United States. However, influences such as competing vegetation, previous land cover, plantation size, and site preparation techniques may have varying outcomes on restorative successes. We established 219 plots (. 02 ha) in 29 oak plantations located within Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge (Williamson County, Illinois) 15 - 18 years after mechanical planting. Sampling data for all trees over breast height included species, diameter, and lianas existence on the main bole of the tree. Additionally, <b>free-to-grow</b> status was recorded for all oak saplings and estimated cover of the exotic invasive shrub Elaeagnus umbellata and vine Lonicera japonica were documented. Results show significantly higher numbers of total oaks and <b>free-to-grow</b> oaks in plantings previously cropped in clover and soybeans when compared to the fallow sites host to brush species that received treatment (mowing and or herbicidal application). Significantly less oaks in the soybean and clover categories possessed a vine on the main bole of the tree when compared to the treated brush sites. Brush sites showed a significantly less number of total trees compared to clover and soybean covers and a higher percent of autumn olive cover (%) compared to soybeans. No significance was found in the percent of oaks with a vine, the percent of oaks overtopped, E. umbellata density or L. japonica cover (%) across the four previous vegetation categories. One treatment of pre-planting mowing and herbicidal application is not effective on fallow sites that are host to early successional species and money should not be invested on Quercus trees or mowing and herbicidal treatments in these scenarios. The results suggest that it is best to plant Quercus species immediately following clover or soybean harvest on abandoned agricultural lands before early successional species become established...|$|E
40|$|Black-tailed {{deer and}} Roosevelt elk are found {{throughout}} conifer-dominated Pacific Northwest forests {{west of the}} Cascade Crest, where they are important aesthetically, culturally, ecologically, and recreationally. Throughout their annual cycles, deer and elk {{use a variety of}} forest types and age classes to meet their basic requirements: food, water, cover, breeding, and young-rearing. Although their foraging strategies differ, black-tailed deer (browsers) and Roosevelt elk (grazers) often use the same forests. In general, forage plants for deer and elk are shade intolerant and are stimulated to grow when exposed to direct sunlight. As such, deer and elk often use clearcut patches following harvest. For Douglas-fir and other conifer species in the Pacific Northwest, the first five years after planting (i. e., stand initiation) is the most vulnerable period in which trees are exposed to wildlife damage, as young trees are within forage height and have not yet reached a <b>free-to-grow</b> condition. Because of this, foraging by deer and elk (hereafter, herbivory) has been documented as the most widespread form of damage in reforestation efforts in the Pacific Northwest...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} restore American {{chestnut}} (Castanea dentata) through the planting of blight-resistant (Cryphonectria parasitica) trees {{is currently being}} tested. Forest-based research on the species&# 8217; silvicultural requirements and chestnut blight development are lacking. Pure American chestnut seedlings were planted in a two-age shelterwood forest with low residual basal area and in a midstory-removal treatment with high residual basal area. Survival did not differ between silvicultural treatments and averaged 67 percent across both treatments by the fifth year. Trees in the two-age shelterwood were 2. 36 m and 16. 8 mm larger in height and ground-line diameter, respectively, compared to trees in the midstory-removal by the fifth growing season. Blight occurrence was not affected by silvicultural treatment. Exploratory analyses indicated that seedling grading at planting and keeping trees <b>free-to-grow</b> through competition control {{would have resulted in}} a two-year gain in height and GLD growth in the two-age shelterwood treatment. The two-age shelterwood represented the most efficacious prescription for chestnut restoration, but the midstory-removal prescription may offer a reasonable alternative in areas where harvesting must be delayed...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that some plant pathogenic fungi can be developed as inundative biological control agents (mycoherbicides) to suppress native competing for-est vegetation in conifer regeneration sites. Biological control agents need to be suffi-ciently virulent to mitigate the aggressiveness of competing vegetation, while allowing crop trees to compete successfully to the <b>free-to-grow</b> stage. To manage hardwood weeds in conifer regeneration sites and utility rights-of-way, an experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of the wound pathogen Chondrostereum purpureum (Pers. :Fr.) Pouzar as compared to the herbicide Vision®. Results indicate that C. purpureum is as effective as Vision ® for control of red alder. In another pathosystem, weedy Rubus spp. are being tar-geted due to their capacity to rapidly invade reforestation and riparian sites, effectively reducing the growth and survival of young planted and naturally regenerating conifer seedlings. A potential candidate, Fusarium avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc. was selected and applied inundatively on target weeds under greenhouse conditions. Test plants receiving formulated F. avenaceum combined with 0. 4 % Silwet L- 77 induced significant foliar necrosis. These two pathosystems are presented as examples for an applied biocontrol strategy for vegetation management in forestry and will be discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the Central Hardwood Forest {{region of}} the United States, the {{variable}} and somewhat unpredictable establishment success of hardwood tree plantations has traditionally been attributed to competing vegetation and damage due to animal browse. We examined operational plantation estab-lishment success (1 – 5 years following planting) {{as it relates to}} use of particular silvicultural practices. Silvicultural histories were obtained for 87 randomly selected plantations throughout Indiana and field data were collected from each to determine tree survival, tree vigor, and abundance of surrounding vegetation. Survival was highest at sites that were treated with herbicide prior to planting and that had been mechanically planted (as opposed to hand planted). The percentage of trees with evidence of dieback was highest on sites at which browse protection measures had been used, likely reflecting a combination of damage due to inherently high white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) populations at such sites and ineffectiveness of current browse protection measures. Sites planted by a professional forester and those with herbicide applied subsequent to planting had a higher percentage of trees deemed <b>free-to-grow.</b> Subsequent herbicide application did not reduce cover or height of competing vegetation; however, when used in conjunction with mechanical site preparation techniques, overall cover and height of herbaceous vegetation was reduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) quantitatively summarize the early yield responses of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) to forest vegetation management (FVM) treatments through a meta-analytical review of the scientific literature, and (2) given (1), estimate the rotational consequences of these responses through model simulation. Based on a fixed-effects meta-analytic approach using 44 treated-control yield pairs derived from 12 experiments situated throughout the Great Lakes—St. Lawrence and Canadian Boreal Forest Regions, the resultant mean effect size (response ratio) and associated 95 % confidence interval for basal diameter, total height, stem volume, and survival responses, were respectively: 54. 7 % (95 % confidence limits (lower/upper) : 34. 8 / 77. 6), 27. 3 % (15. 7 / 40. 0), 198. 7 % (70. 3 / 423. 5), and 2. 9 % (− 5. 5 / 11. 8). The results also indicated that early and repeated treatments will yield the largest gains in terms of mean tree size and survival. Rotational simulations indicated that FVM treatments resulted in gains in stand-level operability (e. g., reductions of 9 and 5 yr for plantations established on poor-medium and good-excellent site qualities, resp.). The challenge of maintaining coniferous forest cover on recently disturbed sites, attaining statutory-defined <b>free-to-grow</b> status, and ensuring long-term productivity, suggest that FVM will continue to be an essential silvicultural treatment option when managing black spruce plantations...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{practices}} can {{be applied}} in even-age stands to reallocate site resources to selected crop trees. Precornrnercial thinning in sapling stands can increase diameter growth and improve species composition of trees in the main canopy. Commercial thinning in sawtimber stands also increases diameter growth of crop trees, improves residual stand quality, and removes trees that would die absent thinning. Silviculturists need quantitative information on the response of particular species to thinning treatments to meet specific management objectives. In this study, 7 - to 80 -year-old northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) crop trees in unrnanaged, even-age central Appalachian stands were given various degrees of crown release. The response of released trees was {{compared to that of}} controls. Results of these individual trials, formerly published in numerous separate reports, are synthesized and combined with new information from more recent studies. Crown growing space, derived from the proportion of crown perimeter <b>free-to-grow</b> and distance to adjacent competing trees, is a significant independent variable that affects growth response. Crown growing space has a positive effect on dbh growth and crown expansion and a negative effect on height growth and length of clear stem. The impact of crown growing space d i s h e s with tree age, though sigmficant increases in dbh growth were observed for 80 -year-old trees. Applications of crown release treatments might be usefbl in producing timber products, improving wildlife habitat, or in accelerating the development of old-growth and other desired stand conditions...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{regeneration}} {{dynamics in}} forests disturbed by three different windthrow events in 2008 in Slovenia {{to assess the}} success of natural regeneration vs planting and subsequent silvicultural treatments. Fifty-three plots with planted saplings of Norway spruce and sycamore maple and 50 plots with dominant naturally regenerated saplings were selected in a randomly stratified manner. Sapling characteristics (height, height increment, root collar diameter, <b>free-to-grow</b> score, browsing and micro-site) were assessed in 2012 and 2014. Herbs and seedling establishment were studied in two subplots within each plot. Average seedling density was 13, 074 and 14, 674 ha% 1 four and six years after the windthrows, respectively. Seedlings were irregularly distributed, which suggests micro-site differences in regeneration dynamics. The results indicated lower seedling success on sites that were southerly exposed, farther from the forest edge and seed trees, on undisturbed micro-sites and at higher altitudes. On such sites planting was justified. While seedling density indicated a positive relation to herb coverage, sapling survival was negatively associated with {{it as well as}} with browsing. Initial sapling height was the strongest predictor of survival. Spruce saplings had the lowest mortality, while shade-tolerant silver fir and beech experienced high mortality. The study indicated a high density and species diversity of naturally regenerated seedlings within windthrow areas, which was reduced by planting, mowing of competing vegetation and protection measures favouring planted saplings. Recommendations for the improvement of silvicultural operations for post windthrow restoration are given...|$|E
40|$|Neighbourhood {{competition}} indices (NCI), where {{position and}} species identity of neighbours are known, {{have been used}} to investigate growth and competitive interactions among adult trees. In this study, we used NCI in 8 – 15 -year-old stands following clear-cutting in a boreal mixedwood forest of eastern Canada to improve our understanding of early successional forest dynamics. Trees of increasing diameter from the center (≥ 1 cm) to the edge (≥ 5 cm) were mapped in twenty-five circular 450 m 2 plots. Target trees (DBH≥ 1 cm) were sampled in plot center to determine their annual radial stem growth. For each species, we compared a set of growth models using either a spatially explicit NCI or a non-spatial competition index. Both types of indices estimated a species-specific competition coefficient for each pair of competitor–target species. NCI were selected as the best competition model for all target species although differences in variance explained relative to the non-spatial index were small. This likely indicates that competition occurs at the local level but that the high density and the relative uniformity of these young stands creates similar neighbourhoods for most trees in a given stand. The effective neighbourhood radius for competitors varied among species and was smaller for shade tolerant species. Intraspecific neighbours were the strongest competitors for most species. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) was a weak competitor for all species as opposed to balsam fir (Abies balsamea) which was a strong competitor in all cases. These results are in contradiction with some widely used forest policies in North America (e. g. <b>free-to-grow</b> standards) that consider broadleaf species, such as aspen, as the strongest competitors. For these early successional forests, the decision regarding the use of spatial or non-spatial competition indices should rest on the intended use. For even-age management, spatial indices might not justify their use in highdensity stands but they are needed for the simulation of novel harvest techniques creating complex stand structure...|$|E
