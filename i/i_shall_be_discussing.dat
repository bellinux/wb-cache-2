The division based on Kuryłowicz’s (1965) redefinition of Meillet’s (1912) original term grammaticalisation is usually described as a process that renders lexical language signs grammatical and grammatical language signs even more grammatical. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> suggest that since grammaticalization, i. e. becoming grammar, was originally, i. e.

The study aims to be a {{critical}} analysis of Ibsenstafetten as a social-cultural and cultural-political phenomenon in society at large, and as an incentive for innovative praxis in Norwegian classrooms within high schools and colleges in particular. The study will attempt {{to look at the}} question of aesthetic knowledge and the conditions for aesthetic learning in the subjects Norwegian and Drama and in cross curricular projects such as Ibsenstafetten in High Schools and colleges: What exactly is aesthetic knowledge?- and How can we make it come about? My aim is to develop theories about aesthetic learning, grounded on field work done in relation to Ibsenstafetten 1, where Ibsen’s works is in the center, the pivotal source. Hence, Ibsen’s plays are simultaneously the focus of attention for the innovative practice, as well as the object of inquiry and exploration pertaining to different genres of performance. In short, Ibsen’s world is the arena in which the performative actions of teacher and students are played out. I will venture to analyze the learning potential of performance work in the classroom, and see it not only in the light of theatre arts subjects, but in the light of Norwegian, and with special reference to the controversial and challenging field of ‘norsk muntlig’, oral skills. This will be discussed in relation to the National Curriculum plan and the stated objectives there of preparing our youth for democratic citizenship.

40|$|In {{an article}} written in 1977 the author offered {{a survey of}} {{unresolved}} problems in rational choice theory. The present paper {{is an attempt to}} rethink this issue. On the one hand, it emphasizes the question of indeterminacy, i. e. situations in which the rational choice is not well defined. The paradoxes of backward induction find their place here, as do the existence and importance of genuine uncertainty (as distinct from risk). On the other hand, the article discusses the question whether preferences can be said to be rational. Examples include time preferences, attitudes to risk, regret and the 'taste for fairness'. The examples are chosen with a view to showing that rational choice theory is not a predictive theory, hut essentially a hermeneutic one. As part of the enterprise of self-understanding, the construction of rationality is partly discovery and partly decision. There is no right answer to all questions. Fifteen years ago I wrote a long survey essay with the same title as this paper, 'Some unresolved problems in the theory of rational behavior'. 1 The present paper is to some extent, but only to a small extent, an attempt to take stock of {{what has happened in the}} meantime. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> not really <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> whether any of the problems I identified then have <b>been</b> solved.

In this language, {{two different types}} of agents are called “breeds.” Here, the two breeds are basically of identical form, but can, with this breed distinction, recognize any other member as being a same breed member, or an opposite breed member. In the same way that opposite magnetic poles of bar magnets show diametrically opposed attractions, the behavior of different fields in the photosphere behave quite contrary to traditional magnetic fields in a vacuum. For example, {{in the early days of}} an active region (during its growth phase), we see same sign magnetic field in the photosphere attracting like-field, and opposite field being repelled from each other (contrary to vacuum electromagnetic theory). On the other hand, on large-scales, and/or when an active region's growth phase has subsided, one observes “normal” behavior of magnetic entities: e.g. on large-scales opposite fields attract each other (e.g. the polar fields attract opposite sign entities via the subsurface B-L field), and same-sign fields spread apart into a more homogeneous field (a UMR). Our breeds will consist of two generic entities. The two breeds have different colors, blue and red, representing outward and inward pointing magnetic fields respectively. The direction any particular agent is moving, relative to the fluid, will be shown by the direction of the field entity's arrow. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> their properties, in particular their birth, disappearance, and movements.

40|$|Pictorial {{representation}} is one species of visual representation [...] {{but not the}} only one, I argue. There are three additional varieties or species of visual representation [...] namely 'structural', 'aspect ' and 'integrative ' representation [...] which together comprise a category of 'delineative ' rather than depictive visual representation. I arrive at this result via consideration of previously neglected orientational factors that serve to distinguish the two categories. I conclude by arguing that pictures (unlike 'delineations') are not physical objects, and that their multiplicity and modal narrowness motivates a view of them as instead being (one kind of) 'delineatively ' represented content or subject matter, as represented by those objects that are (commonly but wrongly, in my view) assumed to be pictures. By a 'visual representation ' I mean roughly an item that is both visible itself, and which purports to represent some actual subject (that in paradigm cases is also visible), {{in such a way}} that the representing item is in some way similar to, or recognizable as, the purported actual subject; and which item has a representational content or subject matter that may or may not accurately characterize any actual subject. 1 Pictorial {{representation is}} one species of visual representation. 2 However, one of my main concerns in this paper will be to argue that there are no less than three additional varieties or species of visual representation, none of which are currently adequately recognized, and which together comprise a category of visual representation distinct from that of pictorial representation.

This significant trend in cultural heritage preservation is increasingly evident in professional conferences, publications, and discussions, and is beginning {{to have an impact on}} preservation methodologies.

Udmurts are Finno-Ugric people of the Permean language group (Ural-Altaic Family> Uralic languages> Finno-Ugric branch> Permean group). In 2002 they numbered 636, 935, most of them living in the Udmurt Republic of the Russian Federation which is located about 1000 km east of Moscow, but with small groups settled in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and the Kirov Region (Lallukka 1990). <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> a group that settled in Tatarstan Republic, which is {{another part of the}} Russian Federation (the southern neighbour of the Udmurt Republic), and I shall begin by defining some of the concepts used in the paper. Prayer, to pray. From the Udmurt root vös’- derive nouns vös ’ – “prayer, sacrifice, religion, faith”, vös’as’kon – “prayer, sacrifice”, vös’as ’ – “priest”, and verbs vös’any – “to pray, to sacrifice, to hallow”, vös’as’kyny – “to pray, to beg”, vös’atyny – “to sacrifice”. You can notice that there is no difference between praying and sacrificing in the Udmurt language and its dialects. Baptised Udmurts eliminated the part connected with sacrifice from the semantic field of these words, but in the tradition of unbaptised Udmurts praying and sacrificing are very close actions up to the present. Large prayer house – byd’z’ym kuala (large/great cabin/hut).

I shall go on to map out the types of defamiliarisation they offer the reader, linking this with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which asserts, in its strongest form, a determining connection between a culture's language, its thought and its reality. The implications and questions I want to draw from these comparisons are two-fold. The first is socio-linguistic and concerns real life issues of whether linguistic change is a necessary part of conceptual change. I shall offer some observations about pressures for certain types of change made by various minority and oppressed groups in England and America. The second is literary-critical, in that it concerns the possibility that the language of all texts is best understood when viewed as markedly biased towards various sets of cultural presuppositions.

I shall suggest ways of beginning to deconstruct aspects of that so-called reality, concluding that, whilst there are inevitably features that will always remain opaque — to us, if not to future generations — (and for good epistemological reasons), there are nonetheless ways of making ourselves, and helping our stu-dents, see possibilities of alternative presentations of the worlds given to us in the language of literary texts.

40|$|Any {{discussion}} {{of language and}} time within historical linguistics must begin with {{a consideration of the}} direction of time. The most obvious direc-tion, in the sense that most work in historical linguistics at present follows this course, is from the past towards the present: this is the study of language change, and involves tracing the developments that have transformed an ear-lier stage of a language into a later one. In this paper, however, I shall be concentrating on the opposite direction, and on the idea that, using certain methods, we can reverse time, and find out whether particular languages which are now separate systems, were once a single language. In other words, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> language families. But those languages in the past, like languages today, also had speakers, so it follows that human histories, rather than simply linguistic histories, are necessarily involved. However, it is impossible to find out about those human histories through linguistic work alone: we have to take an interdisciplinary approach. One such approach, which is certainly in the scientific news at the moment, is the ‘new synthesis’. Its proponents argue that we can bring together evidence from linguistics, genetics and archaeology, assess whether meaningful corre-lations exist between these disciplines and then use this cumulative evidence to provide clues to earlier human histories. The idea of constructing trees for linguistic and genetic groupings and measuring the degree of similarity be-tween them is, of course, not a new one: we might trace the start of work on mappings between linguistics and genetics to the publication of the well-known Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1988) parallel linguistic- genetic tree. As is well known, there has been a good deal of criticism of this tree, both because of lack of independence of the populations sampled (some genetic populations, like Na-Dene, are defined {{on the basis of the}} language spoken in the commu-nity, which rather begs the question), and because it includes very long range comparisons – many historical linguists would consider constructs like Amer...|$|E

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{advance in}} one field of human endeavor will often inspire workers in others {{to try to}} transfer its conceptions or techniques into their own less successful fields, for obvious reasons. And so political theorists who have long been discontented {{with the state of}} politics when compared with that of certain other sciences have, in consequence, sought to advance their field by adopting the ideas or techniques of their scientific contemporaries. The impressive application of physics will probably increase both political tension and the political scientists 2 ̆ 7 interest in methodology. The last hundred years of political science have seen attempts at the introduction of various exotica, Darwinism, Economism, Freudianism, even Statisticism; but what <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> here <b>discuss</b> <b>is</b> the centuries-old attempt to appropriate the success of dynamics or mechanics to politics, an attempt which found its first great exponent in Hobbes but which has been carried on in this century by men like Bentley and Catlin. The success of dynamics, such men seem to have thought, is evidently the result of its method, which they took to be the reduction of phenomena to the primary qualities of matter and motion. We who are interested in politics, accordingly, will do well to copy the method of the successful scientists and reduce all political phenomena to similar primary entities. Just as Newtonian physicists speak of material bodies or particles, and the forces they exert upon each other, so we must confine ourselves to the description of the motions of atomic political bodies and the forces they exert upon each other. Thus we need only speak with Hobbes of men and their desires, or with Catlin of political men and their wills, or with Bentley of groups and their pressures, in order to succeed. We know that, in the early chapters of Leviathan, Hobbes announced this as his programme; but it is doubtful whether, as he moved from methodology to political theory, he did as he said he would do and whether he had not worked out his political theory before he “deduced” it from his primary entities of matter and motion. In what follows <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> try to show a similar history in the work of A. F. Bentley and D. B. Truman. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> try to show that Bentley announced a methodological programme and that Truman 2 ̆ 7 s “development” of it has been quite external and could, in fact, have been undertaken without any reference to Bentley at all. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> try to show, that is, that Bentley 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to political science has been of a psychological rather than a logical kind, and that the references made to him by contemporary pressure group theorists are similar to those which a Russian physicist might make to dialectical materialism...|$|R
