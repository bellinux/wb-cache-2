5|$|<b>Fleas</b> are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by <b>fleas</b> include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. <b>Fleas</b> can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. <b>Fleas</b> that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog <b>fleas.</b>|$|E

40|$|Only a {{few studies}} {{comparing}} <b>flea</b> composition on the coast and in the mountains have been conducted. We investigated differences in <b>flea</b> communities infesting small mammals in selected habitats in northern, central and southern Poland. We predicted: (1) {{a greater number of}} <b>flea</b> species in the southeastern Poland and a lower number in the north; (2) a greater number of <b>flea</b> species in fertile and wet habitats than in poor and arid habitats; (3) a low similarity of <b>flea</b> species between <b>flea</b> communities in western and eastern Poland. We found negative effect of increasing latitude on <b>flea</b> species richness. We suppose that the mountains providing a variety of environments and the limits of the geographic ranges of several <b>flea</b> subspecies in southeastern Poland, result in a higher number of <b>flea</b> species. There was positive effect of increasing wetness of habitat on <b>flea</b> species richness. We found a high diversity in <b>flea</b> species composition between western and eastern Poland (beta diversity = 11) and between central and eastern Poland (beta diversity = 12).

40|$|International audienceWe studied {{patterns}} {{of variation in}} species composition of <b>flea</b> assemblages on small mammals across different habitats of Slovakia and compared <b>flea</b> species composition within and across host species among habitats. We asked (1) how variable the composition of <b>flea</b> assemblages is among different populations of the same host occurring in different habitats and (2) whether the composition of <b>flea</b> assemblages in a habitat is affected either by species composition of hosts or by environmental affinities of this habitat. Between-habitat similarity in <b>flea</b> species composition increased {{with an increase in}} the similarity in host species composition. Species richness of <b>flea</b> assemblages of a host species correlated positively with mean number of cohabitating host species but not with the number of habitats occupied by a host species. Results of the ordination of <b>flea</b> collections from each individual host demonstrated that the first five principal components explained most of the variance in species composition of <b>flea</b> assemblages. The segregation between rodent and insectivore <b>flea</b> assemblages was easily discerned from the ordination diagram when <b>flea</b> assemblages were plotted according to their hosts. When <b>flea</b> assemblages were plotted according to their habitat affinities, the distinction of habitats based on variation in <b>flea</b> composition was not as clear. The results of ANOVA of each principal component showed the significant effect of both host species and habitat type. The variation in each principal component was explained better by the factor of host species compared with the factor of habitat type. Multidimensional scaling of <b>flea</b> assemblages within host species across habitats demonstrated that among-habitat variation in <b>flea</b> composition was manifested differently in different hosts...|$|R

5|$|<b>Fleas</b> {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of <b>fleas</b> are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by <b>fleas</b> that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fleas</b> feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. <b>Fleas</b> normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian <b>fleas</b> that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E

5|$|In many species, <b>fleas</b> are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. <b>Fleas</b> are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. <b>Fleas</b> can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|Three <b>flea</b> beetle species (Aphthona spp.), first {{introduced}} into North America in 1988, {{have come to}} be regarded as effective biological control organisms for leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). The black <b>flea</b> beetles (Aphthona lacertosa and A. czwalinae) in particular have been shown to cause reductions in leafy spurge stem counts in the northern Great Plains, while the brown <b>flea</b> beetle (A. nigriscutis) has persisted and spread, but has not been found to be as effective at controlling leafy spurge. The ability of black <b>flea</b> beetles to control leafy spurge in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of <b>flea</b> beetle herbivory on leafy spurge, we monitored stem counts of leafy spurge and numbers of black and brown <b>flea</b> beetles at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006. Brown <b>flea</b> beetle numbers were observed to be negligible on these sites. Over the 9 years of the study, black <b>flea</b> beetles were seen to spread over the three study sites and leafy spurge stem counts declined substantially on two of the three sites. Even at low densities of spurge, black <b>flea</b> beetle populations persisted, a necessary prerequisite for long-term control. We used structural equation models (SEM) to assess the yearly effects of black <b>flea</b> beetles, soil texture, and refuge site on leafy spurge stem counts over this time period. We then used equations developed from the SEM analysis to explore <b>flea</b> beetle–leafy spurge dynamics over time, after controlling for soil texture and refuge. Yearly effect strength of black <b>flea</b> beetles on leafy spurge was found to be modest, largely owing to substantial spatial variability in control. However, simulation results based on prediction coefficients revealed leafy spurge to be highly responsive to increases in <b>flea</b> beetle populations on average...|$|R
