40|$|Roesler et al. 1 Airfield rigid {{pavement}} thickness design {{has been based}} on the critical tensile bending stress {{at the bottom of the}} slab. Recent observations from full-scale {{rigid pavement}} tests at the FAA’s NAPTF and Airbus PEP have shown top-down cracking can occur under certain combined loading and pavement geometry configurations. Similar cracking modes have been seen in recent years under certain highway loading and slab situations. The objective of this paper is to identify key slab loading locations on airfield rigid pavements which alter the critical tensile bending stress in the concrete slab from being on the slab bottom to the top of the slab, given no initial curling. Five <b>individual</b> aircraft <b>gear</b> geometries (e. g., dual, dual tandems, triple dual tandems) and four main landing gear (e. g., B- 777, A- 380, MD- 11, and B- 747) analyses were conducted for a given slab configuration, pavement geometry, and materials. The numerical results show that the ratio between the top of the slab and bottom tensile stresses were significantly higher for the main landing gear analysis relative to the <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> analysis. Furthermore, this initial finite element analysis has shown consideration of the entire main landing gear of the aircraft is necessary if the top tensile stresses are going to be accurately predicted...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the feasibility of using stress waves for condition monitoring of gears. The project involved setting up an experimental rig, carrying out experimental work, acquiring stress waves signatures, and processing the signals. It has been shown that stress waves can successfully be employed for early detection of incipient gear failure. A experimental gearbox was employed during the experiments. Miniature ultrasound transducers, both sensitive and sufficiently small, were manufactured and installed on the stationary outer race of the rolling element bearing of the gearbox to detect stress waves from the meshing gears. The stress waves signals from the transducers were digitised and digitally processed to extract relevant information. The signatures were high-pass filtered at a cut-off frequency of 200 kHz, thus representing exclusive ultrasonic frequencies. A new statistical parameter, Energy Index, was developed and performed on the stress wave signatures which were segmented to represent <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. Along with this new parameter, the classical statistical parameters, (Peaks, RMS, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis, etc.) were also performed. Conclusive results are presented in graphical form in terms of Cumulative Energy Indices' and Energy Indices in polar form for <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> teeth. A new algorithrn was also developed and presented for the envelope detection of signal by iterative peak detection. Although no direct comparison was made between condition monitoring of gears using stress waves and methods such as low frequency vibration analysis and wear debris analysis, it is apparent that stress waves monitoring offers a much earlier warning of incipient gear failure because the technique can detect material defonnations which are precursors to changes in the dynamic properties of gears and the occurrence of wear debris. The technique, therefore, can predict incipient failure much earlier, extending the lead-time before failure, and as a result, minimising sudden failures which may have catastrophic consequences...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} seabed {{pressure}} of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area {{and depth of}} seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed {{at the level of}} the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear “footprints”. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from <b>individual</b> larger <b>gear</b> components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size–gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by métier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~ 1. 6 km 2 h - 1 of which 0. 08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0. 19 km 2 h - 1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of diagnostic methods for gear tooth faults in aerospace power transmission systems {{is an active}} research area being driven largely by the interests of military organisations or large aerospace organisations. In aerospace applications, the potential results of gear failure are serious, ranging from increased asset downtime to, at worst, catastrophic failure with life-threatening consequences. New monitoring techniques which can identify the onset of failure at earlier stages are in demand. Acoustic Emission (AE) is the most sensitive condition monitoring tool and is a passive technique that detects the stress wave emitted by a structure as cracks propagate. In this study a gear test rig that allows the fatigue loading of an <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> tooth was utilised. The rig allows a full AE analysis of damage signatures in gear teeth without the presence of constant background noise due to rotational and frictional sources. Furthermore this approach allows validation of AE results using crack gauges or strain gauges.

40|$|Catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is a {{quantitative}} method {{used to describe}} fisheries worldwide. CPUE can be presented as number of fish per 1000 hooks, number of fish per amount of fishing time, or with any unit of effort that best describes the fishery (e. g., search time, hooks per hour, number of trawls). CPUE is commonly used as an index to estimate relative abundance for a population. These indices are then applied within stock assessments so that fisheries managers can make justified decisions for how to manage a particular stock or fishery using options such as quotas, catch limitations, gear and license restrictions, or closed areas. For commercial pelagic longline (PLL) fisheries, onboard observer data are considered the only reliable data available due to the large-scale movements of highly migratory species (HMS) like tunas {{and because of the}} high costs associated with fisheries independent surveys. Unfortunately, fishery-reported logbook data are heavily biased in favor of the target species and the expense of onboard observers results in a low percentage of fleet coverage. Subsequently, CPUE derived from fishery-dependent data tends to overestimate relative abundance for highly migratory species. The spatial distribution of fish and fishing effort is essential for understanding the proportionality between CPUE and stock abundance. A spatial metric was created (SCPUE) for <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> deployments using observer-based catch and effort data from the western North Atlantic PLL fleet. SCPUE was found to be less variable than CPUE when used as an index of relative abundance, suggesting that SCPUE could serve as an improved index of relative abundance within stock assessments because it explicitly incorporates spatial information obtained directly from the fishing location. Areas of concentrated fishing effort and fine-scale aggregations of target and non-target fishes were identified using the optimized hot spot analysis tool in ArcGIS (10. 2). This SCPUE method describes particular areas of fishing activity in terms of localized fish density, thus eliminating the assumption that all fish in a population are dispersed evenly within statistical management zones. The SCPUE metric could also assist fisheries management by identifying particular areas of concern for HMS and delineating boundaries for time-area closures, marine protected areas, and essential fish habitat...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional climbing, or [...] "trad" [...] climbing, {{in which}} the leader uses mostly {{removable}} gear (and the occasional bolt placed on lead) to protect against falls. As with all partnered climbing involving belays the climbing team (a leader and follower, or multiple followers) begins {{at the bottom of}} a climb and ascends to the top, the leader placing protective devices in the rock as he/she climbs (Lead climbing). Once the leader is finished climbing, he/she establishes a belay. The follower then [...] "follows" [...] the route and removes all of the gear placed by the leader. It is important that the leader be proficient at placing trad (or clean or natural) gear (cams, stoppers, hexes, tri-cams, etc.) because his/her safety depends upon the soundness of each <b>individual</b> <b>gear</b> placement. Placing trad gear on lead can be time-consuming and thus tiring, sometimes making routes feel harder than their rating. Trad climbing is generally practiced according to ethical principles, that dictate primarily natural gear placements be made. However, when [...] "traditional" [...] was first coined in U.S. climbing literature, traditionalists of the day hand drilled bolts sometimes from delicate stances on lead when cams, stoppers, etc. were not possible to place. Some of the resulting traditional routes have long run outs between bolts, requiring a [...] "bold" [...] mentality. More important to the original traditionalists than bolting or not was the overall approach to climbing: no resting on the rope after falls, instead lowering to a stance or pitch beginning or even the ground for restart; no placing of protection from a top rope or rehearsing difficult moves over and over; and no fixing of ropes to high points (sieging) to return with aid for repeated tries. It is, with perhaps the exception of climbing with no rope and prior knowledge of a route Free-soloing, the purest form of climbing. Since the term traditional first emerged in U.S. climbing literature, its use has changed. Some, for example, now will call a climbing style [...] "trad" [...] only if no bolts are encountered, and may relax the old restraint of lowering off tension for restarts after a fall.|$|R
