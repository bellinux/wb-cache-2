5000|$|The name [...] "Haldwani" [...] is an anglicized {{version of}} the Kumaoni word [...] "Halduvani" [...] (literally [...] "forest of Haldu"), named after the tree of [...] "Haldu" [...] (Kadamb), known to botanists as Haldina cordifolia.

50|$|In 1816, {{after the}} British {{defeated}} Gorkhas, and {{gained control of}} Kumaon by the Treaty of Sugauli, Gardner was appointed the Commissioner of Kumaon. Later George William Trail took over as Commissioner and renamed Halduvani as Haldwani in 1834. Though British records suggest that the place was established in 1834, as a mart for hill people who visited the Bhabhar (Himalayan foothills) region, during the cold season. The township, formerly located in Mota <b>Haldu,</b> had only thatched houses. Brick-houses began to be built only after 1850. The first English middle school was established in 1831.|$|E
50|$|Mixed forests - The maximum {{forest cover}} in the state is that of mixed forests, which {{includes}} teak (Tectona grandis) or sal (Shorea robusta) mixed with other species like saja (Terminalia tomentosa), bija (Pterocarpus marsupium), lendia (Lagerstroemia parviflora), <b>haldu</b> (Haldina cordifolia), dhaora (Anogeissus latifolia), salai (Boswellia serrata), aonla (Emblica officinalis), amaltas (Cassia fistula), gamhar (Gmelina arborea), etc. Dazzling white kulu (Sterculia urens) trees scattered around stand out conspicuously among the various hues of green. The ground is covered with maze of grasses, plants, bushes and saplings.Pterocarpus marsupium is also used for control of blood sugar in Diabetes since ancient times in India.|$|E

Another important tree for both wildlife and tribal people of this region is mahua. The flowers of this tree are eaten by mammals and birds, and also harvested by the tribal people as food and to brew beer.|$|E
50|$|On the Shivalik foothills {{and in the}} terai-bhabhar area {{grow the}} sal and {{gigantic}} <b>haldu.</b> Along river courses the shisham grows in abundance. The Vindhyan forests have dhak, teak, mahua, salai, chironji and tendu. Sisso is mostly used for furniture while khair yields kattha, which is taken with betel leaves or pan. Semal and gutel are used as matchwood and kanju in the plywood industry. Babul provides the principal tanning material of the state. Some of the grasses such as baib and bamboo are raw material for the paper industry. Tendu leaves are used in making bidis (Indian cigarettes), and cane is used in baskets and furniture.|$|E

40|$|There are two trees amidst us that {{go under}} the name ‘kadam’; the one being {{featured}} in this issue will here be called the ‘true ’ kadam. Also known as the <b>haldu,</b> this fine tree (Adina cordifolia) can grow to an imposing height – up to 30 metres, or high as an 8 -storey building – though its lateral spread isn’t as luxuriant. While its leaves, somewhat heart-shaped, signify its specific name, they are not clinchingly diagnostic (as several of our trees sport roughly heart-shaped leaves), but its abundant blossoms are. They are small, even inconspicuous (just some 3 - 4 cm across, like large playing marbles), but on close inspection are quite striking. Each is a perfectly spherical inflorescence, tinged yellow, with its flowers putting out straight delicate styles that form a saintly halo around the cluster. The flowers give way to dark round fruits, and this being {{the second half of}} its flowering season, the tree these days bears a mix of the small yellow and brown globes. The best place to spot the <b>haldu</b> is near the hospital, where a couple stand tall, one by the lane that runs parallel to the main avenue, another just {{to the right of the}} entrance to the wards. And a loner stands sentinel at a spot rarely visited: the rear of the IDC compound...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study on arsenical creosote {{with reference to}} leaching, corrosion and anti-borer properties was carried out. Results showed that aging had very {{little effect on the}} preservative which suggested better fixation of the preservative into the wood. Corrosion of mild steel, galvanised iron, aluminium-magnesium alloy (M 57 S) and copper panels in the preservative was found to be negligible. Normal creosote and low temperature creosote of Regional Research Laboratory, Hyderabad, both fortified with arsenic trioxide resisted borer damage on wooden panels for a period of over five months in the port of Cochin. The performance of low temperature creosote fortified with arsenic was found to be equally satisfactory when compared to normal creosote fortified in the same manner. A loading of 208. 6 Kgs/ml³ for <b>Haldu</b> (Adina cordifolia) and 138 Kgs/m³ for Mango (Mangifera indica) in the case of normal creosote and 177 Kgs/m³ for Mango the case of RRL creosote were found to be sufficient for treating the wood...|$|E
40|$|As carrion feeders {{vultures}} play {{an important}} ecological role.   Counts and qualitative assessments were done over three seasons to assess the richness and abundance of vultures in Uttar Pradesh during 2010 – 11.   Of nine species found in India, Uttar Pradesh has six: Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus (45. 9 %), Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris (25. 4 %), Indian Vulture (Long-billed Vulture) Gyps indicus (16. 8 %), White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis (10. 3 %), Red-headed Vulture (King Vulture) Sarcogyps calvus (0. 8 %) and Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis (0. 7 %).   We observed a total of 1993 adults and 91 juveniles, with the Tarai region having the greatest species richness and abundance.   Nesting tree species included Silk Cotton Bombax ceiba, Teak Tectona grandis, <b>Haldu</b> Haldina cordifolia and Sissoo Dalbergia sissoo.   A qualitative assessment indicated that the vulture population had declined in the past 10 – 15 years, with the main causes being the use of diclofenac, shortage of food and habitat loss.   Disposal of dead animals was mainly done by removing carcasses to village outskirts, where dogs, crows and egrets compete with vultures.   Such {{a small number of}} avian scavengers in a large area like Uttar Pradesh should be protected by ensuring safe and sufficient food, recovery from accidents and rehabilitation, and a protected environment. </p...|$|E
