50|$|When unusual sex ratios {{at birth}} (or any other age) are observed, it is {{important}} to consider misreporting, misrecording, or underregistration of births or deaths as possible reasons. Some researchers have in part attributed the high male to female sex ratios reported in mainland China in the last 25 years to the underreporting of the births of female children after the implementation of the one-child policy, though alternative explanations are now generally more widely accepted, including above all the use of ultrasound technology and sex-selective abortion of female fetuses and, probably to a more limited degree, neglect or in some cases infanticide of females. In the case of China, because of deficiencies in the vital statistics registration system, studies of sex ratios at birth have relied either on special <b>fertility</b> <b>surveys,</b> whose accuracy depends on full reporting of births and survival of both male and female infants, or on the national population census from which both birth rates and death rates are calculated from the household's reporting of births and deaths in the 18 months preceding the census. To the extent that this underreporting of births or deaths is sex-selective, both <b>fertility</b> <b>surveys</b> and censuses may inaccurately reflect the actual sex ratios at birth.|$|R

Because Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world and its population is on course to shrink dramatically {{by the middle of the}} century, every five years the government carries out a detailed survey of attitudes to sex and marriage. The studies and surveys have reported loss of sexual drive across several demographics, from adolescent men and women, to married couples. In 2010, the 14th Japanese National <b>Fertility</b> <b>Survey</b> was conducted by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Singles between the ages of 18-34 who are not involved in a romantic relationship and do not want one amounted to 28% for men and 23% for women. It was also found that 28% of men and 26% of women aged 35-39 had no sexual experience. However, the possibility of response bias should be taken into consideration with these figures.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} his career, Coale became {{interested}} in the population changes in China and understanding the fertility transition there as well as factors affecting the sex ratio at birth. In a study conducted by Ansley J. Coale, India and China were compared in both their population size and fertility trends. A survey named the 1/1000 <b>Fertility</b> <b>Survey,</b> reached out to women living in various provinces of China and asked them to relate a brief history of their marital status and a family planning discussion. The survey then served as an understanding of the population and fertility changes that would occur in China shortly after. Published in a Journal article called Population trends in China and India, Coale introduces the possible causes of differences in fertility trends in such high populated countries. These reasons are based on policies put in place to reduce birth rates and some cultural differences that come into play as well. Finally, Coale presents the future of both countries and states that despite the efforts to reduce birth rates, the countries will remain to be most populated.|$|E

50|$|In their Seven Roles of Women: Impact of Education, Migration, and Employment on Ghanaian Mother (International Labour Office, 1987), Christine Oppong and Katherine Abu {{recorded}} field {{interviews in}} Ghana that confirmed a traditional view of procreation. Citing {{figures from the}} Ghana <b>fertility</b> <b>survey</b> of 1983, the authors concluded that about 60 percent {{of women in the}} country preferred to have large families of five or more children. A statistical table accompanying the research showed that the largest number of children per woman was found in the rural areas where the traditional concept of family was strongest. Uneducated urban women also had large families. On the average, urbanized, educated, and employed women had fewer children. On the whole, however, all the interviewed groups saw childbirth as an essential role for women in society, either for the benefits it bestows upon the mother or for the honour it brings to her family. The security that procreation provided was greater in the case of rural and uneducated women. By contrast, the number of children per mother declined for women with post-elementary education and outside employment; with guaranteed incomes and little time at their disposal in their combined roles as mothers and employees, the desire to procreate declined.|$|E

40|$|Background : It {{is common}} in <b>fertility</b> <b>surveys</b> to ask women to {{retrospectively}} rate on a bipolar scale how much they wanted a pregnancy right before they became pregnant. Using a theoretical framework based on the interaction between positive and negative desires for pregnancy, we argue that the mid-point response to a bipolar survey question about preconception childbearing desires implicitly measures an ambivalence/indifference dimension of their preconception motivation. Objective : We create a variable that measures this dimension and examine its construct validity by testing hypotheses about how scores on this dimension predict the postconception wantedness of a pregnancy and how certain social and demographic contexts influence that prediction. Methods : Using data from the 2006 − 2010 National Survey of Family Growth, we use linear regression analyses to test these hypotheses on over 5, 000 pregnancies {{that occurred in the}} 3 years prior to the survey interview. Results : The results confirm our general hypothesis that women who endorse the bipolar scale at or near the mid-point, and thus are high scorers on the proposed ambivalent/indifferent dimension, tend to resolve their preconception mixed feelings in the direction of wanting their pregnancies after they have occurred. The results also confirm that whether or not preconception mixed feelings are resolved in the direction of postconception wantedness depends upon the woman's relationship status at the time of conception, her age at conception, her income, and -within certain racial/ethnic groups, her level of education and income. Conclusions : We conclude that the dimension of ambivalent/indifferent desires provides additional explanatory power for the construct of postconception pregnancy wantedness and that our findings support the development of measures of positive and negative desires for pregnancy so that the constructs of ambivalent and indifferent childbearing desires may be directly measured in future <b>fertility</b> <b>surveys...</b>|$|R

We propose a modeling strategy for the event history analysis of WFS data which overcomes these problems, and we apply it to the previously unanalyzed WFS data from Iran. This yields estimates of the time of onset of fertility decline {{and the extent to which}} it was due to compositional changes in the population.
