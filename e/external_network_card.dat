Each <b>network</b> <b>card</b> or wireless <b>network</b> <b>card</b> has a Media Access Control (MAC) address {{that is used to}} tell them apart. The MAC address is a series of 12 characters usually in the form xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx and is burned into the hardware of a <b>network</b> <b>card.</b> The first 6 characters distinguish what company made the card and the rest are unique to identify that specific card. This is in accordance with IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1) standards. MAC address spoofing refers to someone changing their MAC address in order to resemble that of another <b>network</b> <b>card</b> for various reasons. This Specification defines the different MAC Spoofing Techniques and its Countermeasure. This document includes detail description about MAC Address...|$|R

50|$|QEMU can emulate <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> (of {{different}} models) {{which share}} the host system's connectivity by doing network address translation, effectively allowing the guest {{to use the}} same network as the host. The virtual <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> can also connect to <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> of other instances of QEMU or to local TAP interfaces. Network connectivity can also be achieved by bridging a TUN/TAP interface used by QEMU with a non-virtual Ethernet interface on the host OS using the host OS's bridging features.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to other UUID versions, version 1 and 2 UUIDs based on MAC addresses from <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> rely for their uniqueness {{in part on}} an identifier issued by a central registration authority, namely the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) part of the MAC address, which is issued by the IEEE to manufacturers of networking equipment. The uniqueness of version 1 and 2 UUIDs based on <b>network</b> <b>card</b> MAC addresses also depends on <b>network</b> <b>card</b> manufacturers properly assigning unique MAC addresses to their cards, which like other manufacturing processes is subject to error.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{integrate}} the DMA data transmission technology and memory mapping technology to implement zero-copy in the Linux operating system. Zero-copy allocates memory address space to <b>network</b> <b>card.</b> In this case, the <b>network</b> <b>card</b> directly transmits the received {{data to the}} memory space allocated in advance when the <b>network</b> <b>card</b> transmits the data to the Linux kernel by using DMA. After that, zero-copy maps the allocated memory space to the process space of the user application. And then, the user application can access this allocated memory space directly and reduce the memory copies between the kernel and user space. 1...|$|R
