5|$|The {{architect}} Norman Shaw, then aged 73, {{was brought}} in to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>proposals</b> for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were felt to be unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.|$|E

50|$|The {{project of}} {{converting}} St. Patrick's into a university was mooted {{as early as}} 1563; Adam Loftus, when made dean (28 January 1565), was put under a bond to resign the deanery when required for this purpose.

50|$|On {{the night}} of 15 April 1721 the cathedral, high school and 211 {{residential}} buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the cathedral burned down. As the cathedral walls remained standing, it was possible to restore the building quite quickly. Barely a month after the fire, at the request of city manager (politieborgmästare) Hans von Gerdes (1637-1723), the architect Paul Ludvig Leyonsparre presented three options for rebuilding the church, the third of which was recommended by county governor (landshövding) Nils Posse. The cathedral reopened on 25 May 1722, only 13 months after the fire, with the same dimensions as the old cathedral, but with a tower capital instead of the former spire. The roof proved to be so leaky that county governor Axel Gyllenkrok complained in October 1724 of rain and snow getting through. In December 1725 the city engineer was instructed to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>proposals</b> for a new copper roof covering, and work began in June 1726.|$|E

The first production Tucker automobiles were powered by a converted Franklin helicopter engine supplied by Air Cooled Motors. Carl Doman, an engineer with Air Cooled, built a higher horsepower engine, 275 horsepower vs 166 horsepower, but was voted down by management who felt the car was fast enough with the stock powerplant. The higher horsepower engine was {{to be put on}} the shelf for a future model called the Talisman, of which both Alex Tremulis and his assistant, Phil Egan, would eventually <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>proposals</b> for.
