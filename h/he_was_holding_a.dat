Bukovsky appealed against the decision at the RF Supreme Court on 28 December 2007 and, subsequently, before its cassation board on 15 January 2008.|$|E

25|$|Forrester {{attended}} the University of Paris, graduating Bachelor of Arts under fellow-Scot William de Trebrun in March 1375, and becoming Licentiate in Arts the following May.

By 12 April 1384 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> canonry attached to Aberdeen Cathedral.

500|$|There were no air marshals on the flight, {{but several}} {{passengers}} and crew noticed the explosion. Jasper Schuringa from the Netherlands, a passenger {{on the other end}} of the same row, saw Abdulmutallab sitting and shaking. He tackled and overpowered him. Schuringa saw the suspect's pants were open, and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> burning object. [...] "I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away," [...] said Schuringa, who suffered burns to his hands. Meanwhile, flight attendants extinguished the fire with a fire extinguisher and blankets, and a passenger removed the partially melted, smoking syringe from Abdulmutallab's hand.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall's own {{reaction}} was that [...] "in {{so far as}} international affairs are concerned, a seizure of power by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia would not materially alter...the situation which has existed {{in the last three}} years". Even as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> press conference to push his economic aid plan on 10 March, the CIA reported that [...] "We do not believe...that this event reflects any sudden increase in Soviet capabilities, more aggressive intentions, or any change in current Soviet policy or tactics...The Czech coup and the demands on Finland...do not preclude the possibility of Soviet efforts to effect a rapprochement with the West", but the administration chose a different course.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966 Surtees left Ferrari in mid-season. Bandini was {{promoted}} to team leader. He was unlucky not to win the French and U.S. Grands Prix that year which he dominated before mechanical problems intervened while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> huge lead. Bandini's best finish was a second place at the Monaco Grand Prix in a 2.4 liter V-6 Ferrari behind Jackie Stewart's BRM. Later in the season Bandini helped director John Frankenheimer with his movie [...] "Grand Prix". Bandini recommended the location at the harbour chicane for a crash scene in the movie filmed at the Monte Carlo circuit. In [...] "The Making of Grand Prix", actress Eva Marie Saint noted that, bitterly, this spot would {{be the site of}} Bandini's death in the race one year later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{officers}} {{testified that}} they loudly {{identified themselves as}} NYPD officers, but a witness, Schrrie Elliott, testified that they started shooting without any warnings. Diallo ran up the outside steps toward his apartment house doorway at their approach, ignoring their orders to stop and [...] "show his hands". The porch lightbulb was out and Diallo was backlit by the inside vestibule light, showing only a silhouette. Diallo then reached into his jacket and withdrew his wallet. Seeing the man holding a small square object, Carroll yelled [...] "Gun!" [...] to alert his colleagues. The officers opened fire on Diallo, claiming that they believed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> gun. During the shooting, lead officer McMellon tripped backward off the front stairs, causing the other officers to believe he had been shot. The four officers fired 41 shots, {{more than half of}} which went astray as Diallo was hit 19 times.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{not clear}} where they {{intended}} to take them, all accounts agree that Standing resisted by turning towards the mob and in a loud voice commanded them to [...] "Surrender." [...] When he made this declaration <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> pistol a member of the mob had left unguarded on a nearby tree stump. In response, Standing was immediately shot in forehead [...] "directly above the nose". Another member of the mob then pointed to Clawson and said [...] "Shoot that man." [...] Clawson folded his arms and said [...] "Shoot." [...] Although he appeared calm and maintained composure, he nearly passed out in the anxiety of the moment. For reasons unknown, the same man who moments ago told the mob to shoot Clawson now said [...] "Don’t shoot." [...] As Clawson examined Standing, one man said; [...] "This is terrible; that he should have killed himself in such a manner," [...] claiming that Standing accidentally shot himself [...] "while bringing his weapon into position." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gacy later recollected his {{memories}} of his final day of freedom as being [...] "hazy", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells. Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, {{in the course of}} filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of cannabis to the attendant, a youth named Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: [...] "The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me." [...] Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: [...] "I killed thirty people, give or take a few." [...] Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> rosary to his chin as he prayed while driving.|$|E
2500|$|The backlands {{had little}} in the way of law and order, even the few police in {{existence}} were usually in the pocket of a local [...] "Coronel" [...] - a leading landowner who was also a regional political chief - and would usually take sides in any dispute. Indeed, the poorer portion [...] of the backlands population were generally badly treated by the paramilitary police, and would often prefer the presence of bandits in their settlements over that of the police. In such a society disputes between neighbours could quickly escalate into violent feuding. Virgulino's [...] family fell into a deadly feud with other local families. His father twice moved his family to avoid the escalating dispute, first to Nazaré, and then to Água Branca in the State of Alagoas. These moves proved to be fruitless as violence followed the family, with Virgulino and his brothers Antônio and Levino gaining reputations as troublemakers. Eventually José Ferreira was killed in a confrontation with the police on May 18, 1921. Virgulino sought vengeance and proved to be extremely violent in doing so. He became an outlaw, a cangaceiro, and was incessantly pursued by the police (whom he called macacos or monkeys). Virgulino had acquired the nickname 'Lampião' as early as 1921, allegedly because he could fire a lever-action rifle so fast, that at night it looked as though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> lamp.|$|E
