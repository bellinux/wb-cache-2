5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). A 1991 study {{investigated}} the daily routine of the antelope and found feeding peaks at dawn, in the morning, {{in the afternoon and}} during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal), the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India), herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two <b>females</b> <b>with</b> young calves, three to six adult and yearling <b>females</b> <b>with</b> calves, and male groups with two to 18 members.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the <b>females</b> <b>with</b> more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract <b>females</b> <b>with</b> which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E

5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court <b>females</b> <b>with</b> a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E

5|$|The Andean cock-of-the-rock {{exhibits}} marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{has a large}} disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding <b>females</b> <b>with</b> each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young, all by herself.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} <b>females</b> <b>with</b> young calves, three to six adult and yearling <b>females</b> <b>with</b> calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. <b>Females</b> <b>with</b> pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in <b>females</b> <b>with</b> a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults <b>females</b> <b>with</b> their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few <b>females</b> <b>with</b> which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E

5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court <b>females</b> <b>with</b> a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E

5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous <b>females</b> <b>with</b> their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|E
