25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

6000|$|It's {{odd that}} I heard {{this at the}} time with unutterable contempt, and now that I recall it--well, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> what have I got better? ...|$|E
3000|$|... “When I got seriously {{depressed}} last year, I {{decided to}} divorce. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> {{why are you}} still with him?” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> whether, {{by making}} a brave attempt, they might not force their way past the French fleet, and thus escape by the sea? ...|$|R
6000|$|Was it possible, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> {{that we were}} mistaken? Had {{we allowed}} {{ourselves}} to be blinded by suspicion, and was Job Lord all he professed? ...|$|R
60|$|CUSINS. [moodily {{walking across}} to Lady Britomart's writing table] Why are we two {{coming to this}} Works Department of Hell? that is what <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] I cried, {{interrupting}} him, {{and throwing}} up my hands, [...] "there is indeed. But why, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> so vast {{a number of}} examples of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “And <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> {{whether you}} have any heart.” She was looking {{straight}} {{at him and he}} gratified her with the usual cold white flash of his even teeth before he answered.|$|E
60|$|During refreshments, I {{noticed that}} Mrs. Wilbur was both fascinated and annoyed at the {{sensation}} {{the girl was}} producing. Where would the matter end? <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{still that}} scene haunted me. And still, even in sleep, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> {{over and over}} again, [...] "How on earth can this be? What's {{the meaning of the}} baby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My heart sank; {{perhaps my}} idiotic jest had indeed driven him away; and again <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Why?" [...] and whirled {{for a moment}} in a vortex of untenable hypotheses.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself!</b> Why was I such a sappy {{as not to}} hurry here the first day I set foot on shore! Well, who'd have thought it--you are as pretty as ever!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear man," [...] she protested, [...] "in {{the first}} place I deny it. In the second, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether you are quite as devoted to me as you were when you first came." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Claude {{promptly}} {{took her}} up. [...] "What do I offer you, you naturally enquire? My poor chick, that's just what <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself.</b> I don't see it, I confess, quite {{as straight as}} Mrs. Wix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I passed within twenty {{inches of}} the door. 'If I say good-night to them, and go in,' <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> 'what will happen?' And I was all a-tingle for that word with Gurker.|$|R
6000|$|Directly I had uttered {{these words}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> angrily why the deuce did I {{want to say}} that? Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me. What on earth did he mean? ...|$|R
60|$|Was it {{possible}} (<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself)</b> {{that he could}} put his case against Miss Rachel and Rosanna in a more horrid point of view than this? It WAS possible, as you shall now see.|$|R
60|$|BARTHWICK. [Circulating the {{decanter}} {{in religious}} {{imitation of the}} rising and setting of the sun.] <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> whether we are sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we engage them, especially as regards moral conduct.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. The {{entrance}} on my {{duty for}} to-day begins {{the fourth year}} of my official work in Oxford; and I doubt not that some of my audience are asking themselves, very doubtfully--at all events, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> very anxiously--what has been done.|$|E
60|$|Then, again, would <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> was I {{very sure}} of this? And {{so the two}} {{questions}} were flung the one against the other; my conscience divided itself into two parties, and they waged a war that filled me with a depressing uncertainty.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{standing}} near me. [...] "To please ME," [...] she urged, {{in a quick}} undertone, and with a persuasive look that puzzled me. Even in the moment <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> why should this please her? ...|$|R
60|$|Had {{the camp}} {{been in the}} {{possession}} of an enemy there could not have been greater evidences of lawlessness, and again and again <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> what could have happened to bring about such a condition of affairs.|$|R
60|$|As I made it out, however, {{he would}} turn his back on poor Jacob in case the savages had him in their power, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> again and again what course I should pursue in such a situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{far from}} {{regarding}} {{the question in}} that manner, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> if it will be right--if it be possible, to reject the preserver of my own life, the preserver of my father's life, Sigismund Steinbach, {{because he is the}} son of one that men persecute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} that the time may come when she will advertise by photographs and beg from reporters the 'pars' she now so scathingly criticises? Nay, when I look upon the drop scene at the St. James's Theatre, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> if the deterioration has not already set in.|$|E
6000|$|Why--I ask everybody--why worry ME? Nobody {{answers that}} question, and nobody lets me alone. Relatives, friends, and strangers all combine to annoy me. What have I done? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> I ask my servant, Louis, fifty times a day--what have I done? Neither {{of us can}} tell. Most extraordinary! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Why {{have these}} stern facts never {{been put into}} our {{literature}} {{as they have been}} used in Russia and in England? Why has this land no story-tellers like those who have made Massachusetts and New Hampshire illustrious?" ...|$|R
60|$|I forgave him, comforted him, revived him; {{but there}} were moments when the remembrance of what I had seen troubled me in secret, and when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> if <b>I</b> really possessed my husband's full {{confidence}} as he possessed mine.|$|R
60|$|So far I could advance toward realizing my position--and no further. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> {{what was}} to be done next, hopeless confusion, maddening doubt, filled my mind, and {{transformed}} me into the most listless and helpless of living women.|$|R
60|$|Imagine my chagrin. To {{visit them}} in London {{is the one}} thing I desire to do. But how? I accept gratefully, but <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself</b> how it is to be done? I am poor blighter with no {{profession}} and nine 'undred francs. He 'as taken it for granted that I am wealthy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know not; <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>myself,</b> {{what have}} I done? what have I to fear? It is no crime to love; {{it may be}} a misfortune; God knows that I have almost felt to-night that such it was. But no, I never will believe it can be either wrong or unhappy to love you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] {{interposed}} Lomaque again, clasping {{his hands}} {{this time with}} a look of bewilderment; [...] "what objections, what possible objections to a man young and well-bred, with an immense fortune and an uncompromised character?

60|$|He came up, sat down, {{and blew}} out his cheeks, looking inexpressibly fatuous. But I didn't want to laugh any more. And what on earth, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> {{have we been}} {{laughing}} at in this uncontrollable fashion. I felt suddenly depressed.|$|R
60|$|What was I to do? <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>myself</b> that {{question}} several times, and now <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> it again.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "What right have {{men and women}} to bring {{exquisite}} souls like this into a world of disease and death? Why maintain the race? What purpose is subserved by keeping the endless chain of human misery lengthening on?" ...|$|R
