5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts {{in his chair}} and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper").

500|$|On June 30, Barr {{appeared}} on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. He described his qualms with the presumptive Republican nominee, and said [...] "John McCain {{is symptomatic of}} what's wrong with the Republican Party in these {{first years of the}} 21st century. They talk one thing but do something different." [...] When asked if he agreed that McCain would be a better choice than Barack Obama, he responded that it was [...] "a mixed bag" [...] and that [...] "Senator Obama clearly is much better [...] civil liberties and privacy issues" [...] but that he [...] "would favor a more expansive federal spending policy." [...] Barr opined that [...] "neither of these candidates <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> deep cuts in government spending and returning power to the people." [...] He identified the Republican Party's position on FISA legislation as his biggest aversion to the party. When confronted with opinion polls that showed the candidate with 3% in the presidential race, Barr explained that the numbers would increase in the following weeks, announcing that his campaign would be launched [...] "full-time" [...] on July 4.|$|E
500|$|Scenes are {{intercut with}} Rihanna heading to her show within a metro, {{together}} with her audience. As she gets into the arena, scenes are intercut and show the singer and her crew how they are preparing {{for the start of}} the show and shouting the name of the cities in which they performed. The scenes are intercut with Rihanna talking about her love towards Miami, and how she moved first in the city when she got signed to the label. Scenes of her and friends taking shots and having fun are further shown. Then, Rihanna explains how the second section of the Loud Tour is called [...] "Le Sex Shoppe"; the director of the tour Jamie King was inspired for creating the section, after he saw online the pictures of the singer visiting a sex shop in Australia. A scene of an early rehearsal for the tour is also shown, before seeing Rihanna performing [...] "S" [...] live on the concert. After the song, she performs [...] "Skin"; during the performance the singer takes two girls from the audience and performs lap dance as the set finishes with Nuno Bettencourt having a guitar solo.

60|$|It is from Auckland {{that one}} goes to Rotorua, {{the region of}} the renowned hot lakes and geysers--one of the chief wonders of New Zealand; but I was not well enough to make the trip. The {{government}} has a sanitorium there, and everything is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid. The government's official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimates of the efficacy of the baths, when he is talking about rheumatism, gout, paralysis, and such things; but when he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit, he seems to have no reserves. The baths will cure the drinking-habit no matter how chronic it is--and cure it so effectually that even the desire to drink intoxicants will come no more. There should be a rush from Europe and America to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out what they can get by going there, the rush will begin.|$|E

60|$|There is {{more snow}} {{as we go}} north, and Nature is hard at work {{breaking}} up the ground for the spring. The thaw has filled every depression with a sullen gray-black spate, and out on the levels the water lies six inches deep, in stretch upon stretch, {{as far as the}} eye can reach. Every culvert is full, and the broken ice clicks against the wooden pier-guards of the bridges. Somewhere in this flatness there is a refreshing jingle of spurs along the cars, and a man of the Canadian Mounted Police swaggers through with his black fur cap and the yellow tab aside, his well-fitting overalls and his better set-up back. One wants to shake hands with him because he is clean and does not slouch nor spit, trims his hair, and walks as a man should. Then a custom-house officer wants to know too much about cigars, whisky, and Florida water. Her Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of India has us in her keeping. Nothing has happened to the landscape, and Winnipeg, which is, as it were, a centre of distribution for emigrants, stands up to her knees in the water of the thaw. The year has turned in earnest, and somebody <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 'first ice-shove' at Montreal, 1300 or 1400 miles east.|$|E
60|$|Here in Yokohama the Overseas Club has two mails {{and four}} sets of papers--English, French, German, and American, as suits the variety of its constitution--and the {{verandah}} by the sea, where the big telescope stands, is a perpetual feast of the Pentecost. The population of the club changes with each steamer in harbour, for the sea-captains swing in, are met with 'Hello! where did you come from?' and mix {{at the bar and}} billiard-tables for their appointed time and go to sea again. The white-painted warships supply their contingent of members also, and there are wonderful men, mines of most fascinating adventure, who have an interest in sealing-brigs that go to the Kurile Islands, and somehow get into trouble with the Russian authorities. Consuls and judges of the Consular Courts meet men over on leave from the China ports, or it may be Manila, and they all talk tea, silk, banking, and exchange with its fixed residents. Everything is always as bad as it can possibly be, and everybody {{is on the verge of}} ruin. That is why, when they have decided that life is no longer worth living, they go down to the skittle-alley--to commit suicide. From the outside, when a cool wind blows among the papers and there is a sound of smashing ice in an inner apartment, and every third man <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approaching races, the life seems to be a desirable one. 'What more could a man need to make him happy?' says the passer-by. A perfect climate, a lovely country, plenty of pleasant society, and the politest people on earth to deal with. The resident smiles and invites the passer-by to stay through July and August. Further, he presses him to do business with the politest people on earth, and to continue so doing for a term of years. Thus the traveller perceives beyond doubt that the resident is prejudiced by the very fact of his residence, and gives it as his matured opinion that Japan is a faultless land, marred only by the presence of the foreign community. And yet, let us consider. It is the foreign community that has made it possible for the traveller to come and go from hotel to hotel, to get his passport for inland travel, to telegraph his safe arrival to anxious friends, and generally enjoy himself much more than he would have been able to do in his own country. Government and gunboats may open a land, but it is the men of the Overseas Club that keep it open. Their reward (not alone in Japan) is the bland patronage or the scarcely-veiled contempt of those who profit by their labours. It is hopeless to explain to a traveller who has been 'ohayoed' into half-a-dozen shops and 'sayonaraed' out of half-a-dozen more and politely cheated in each one, that the Japanese is an Oriental, and, therefore, embarrassingly economical of the truth. 'That's his politeness,' says the traveller. 'He does not wish to hurt your feelings. Love him and treat him like a brother, and he'll change.' To treat one of the most secretive of races on a brotherly basis is not very easy, and the natural politeness that enters into a signed and sealed contract and undulates out of it so soon as it does not sufficiently pay is more than embarrassing. It is almost annoying. The want of fixity or commercial honour may be due to some natural infirmity of the artistic temperament, or to the manner in which the climate has affected, and his ruler has ruled, the man himself for untold centuries.|$|E
