5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave <b>Gibbons,</b> with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, <b>Gibbons</b> also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. <b>Gibbons</b> stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and he knew he would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the team}} of writers were Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who had created the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show with O'Connor earlier that year, plus Rob <b>Gibbons</b> and Neil <b>Gibbons.</b> Filming of Bedsitcom began in May 2003 and lasted for {{approximately}} eight weeks. The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.|$|E

5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. <b>Gibbons</b> drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, <b>Gibbons</b> would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. <b>Gibbons</b> created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. <b>Gibbons</b> also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to <b>Gibbons,</b> about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

5|$|Hugh's {{register}} of ordinations still survives, {{and is in}} the Lincoln cathedral archives. Parts of this were published by Alfred <b>Gibbons</b> in 1888, and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society.

5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. <b>Gibbons</b> writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. <b>Gibbons</b> goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E

It is native to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It shares the tree tops with orangutans, which, like the <b>gibbon,</b> rarely come out of the trees due to predators, such as tigers and possibly sun bears.|$|R

5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an {{official}} stamp numbering {{system for the}} postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley <b>Gibbons,</b> Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually varieties that the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley <b>Gibbons.</b>|$|E
