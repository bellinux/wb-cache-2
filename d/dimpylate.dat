50|$|Diazinon (IUPAC name: O,O-Diethyl O-4-methyl-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl phosphorothioate, INN - <b>Dimpylate),</b> a colorless to {{dark brown}} liquid, is a thiophosphoric acid ester {{developed}} in 1952 by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss chemical company (later Novartis and then Syngenta). It is a nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide formerly {{used to control}} cockroaches, silverfish, ants, and fleas in residential, non-food buildings. Diazinon was heavily used during the 1970s and early 1980s for general-purpose gardening use and indoor pest control. A bait form was used to control scavenger wasps in the western U.S. Diazinon is used in flea collars for domestic pets in Australia and New Zealand. Residential uses of diazinon were outlawed in the U.S. in 2004 {{but it is still}} approved for agricultural uses. An emergency antidote is atropine.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the ameliorative effect of German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) on the hepato-nephrotoxicity induced by <b>Dimpylate</b> in male Wistar rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups: Control group, received corn oil alone; Chamomile group, orally given water extract of Chamomile (300 mg/kg b. wt. /day for 30 days); <b>Dimpylate</b> group, orally given 15 mg/kg b. wt. /day for 30 days of Dimpylate; and <b>Dimpylate</b> and chamomile group, orally given <b>Dimpylate</b> (15 mg/kg b. wt. /day) with Chamomile extract (300 mg/kg b. wt. /day) for 30 days. Oxidative stress and antioxidant status were estimated in the liver and kidney of all groups. In the liver and kidney of the Dimpylate-intoxicated rats, there was an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and a significant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TCA), glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GSH-R) and Glutathione–S-transferase (GST). In addition, significant increases in serum liver function marker enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) were recorded in <b>Dimpylate</b> intoxicated rats as compared to control group. Moreover, significant increase in serum total lipid, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels was observed in <b>Dimpylate</b> group as compared to control group. Serum total protein was decreased significantly in <b>Dimpylate</b> intoxicated rats as compared to the control group. Renal products; ure...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{and sand}} dust {{resuspension}} {{is one of}} the major input mechanisms for harmful anthropogenic substances into the atmosphere of arid regions. Pesticides and herbicides are the major components of these toxic substances in soils of agricultural regions. This research examines the occurrence of pesticides and herbicides in soil and sand dusts from various locations in the city of Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The organic components, including pesticides, herbicides, fossil fuel residues, and natural lipids were analyzed by GC-MS for this area to define their sources and strengths. The results show that various pesticides and herbicides are present in soil and sand dusts in Riyadh city and include Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Oxadiazon, Ethoprophos, <b>Dimpylate,</b> Iso-Octyl-MCPA, Methyl dichlorofop, Endosulfan I and II, and other unknown derivatives. Anticorrosive reagents such as 1 -chlorododecane and 1 -chlorotetradecane and plasticizers are also significant compounds in these samples. The occurrence of pesticide and herbicide residues in most of the samples from the city is due to activities related to agriculture. Local agriculture and gardening application of these pesticides are suggested to be the main sources of these compounds in soil and sand dusts of th...|$|E

In {{the past}} few years, organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{become one of the}} most widely used classes of pesticides due to their acute toxicity against a wide variety of pests. In this work, a method based on solid-phase microextraction in mode headspace (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed and optimized throughmultivariate factorial design to determine residues of organophosphorus pesticides in cow's milk. Different parameters of the method were evaluated, such as fiber type, temperature, extraction and desorption times, sample volume, effect of salt addition and stirring velocities. The evaluated pesticideswere dichlorvos, sulfotep, demeton-S, <b>dimpylate,</b> disulfoton, parathion,methylparathion, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos and ethion. The best results were obtained using polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber and headspacemode at 90 °C for 45 min, alongwith stirring at 600 rpmand desorption for 5 min at 250 °C. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed methodology was able to determine all of the pesticides with variation coefficients between 6. 1 % and 29. 5 %. Detection and quantification limits ranged from 2. 16 to 10. 85 μg L− 1 and from 6. 5 to 32. 9 μg L− 1, respectively. To evaluate residues of these pesticides inmilk, cows were exposed to the pesticides of interest andmilkwas collected after 24 h. The developedmethodwas able to detect traceamounts of these pesticides in the collected milk samples...|$|E
