25|$|Whale {{meat and}} blubber are Faroese delicacies. Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. Everybody got a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into a saucepan with salt and then boiled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Slivers of the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E

Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.|$|E

2500|$|The Platte River and the North Platte River in {{the future}} states of Nebraska and Wyoming {{typically}} had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was [...] "too thin to plow and too thick to drink". While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and buffalo chips for fuel. The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails {{on both sides of}} the muddy rivers. The Platte was about [...] wide and [...] deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.|$|E
2500|$|As Mosby {{approached}} Leesburg his scouts {{reported to}} him {{the presence of the}} Federals under Forbes in the town.

He led the Rangers out of town towards Ball's Mill on the Carolina Road, believing that the Federals had returned on the same route they had arrived on. At Ball's Mill Mosby was informed by local citizens of his mistake, whereupon he devised a plan to head southeasterly towards Gum Springs (present day Arcola) and intercept the Federals as they traveled east on the Little River Turnpike.|$|E

2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". In her review for the Guardian, Harriet Gibsone said {{the album is}} [...] "another triumph for Sundfør, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects with lightness and majesty." [...] Claire Biddles from the Line of Best Fit said [...] "Music for People in Trouble perhaps doesn't have the crossover appeal that Ten Love Songs had, and its head-on engagement with contemporary struggles will certainly not be for everyone. But {{for those who are}} done with escapism, at least <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> its sustained mood brings rich rewards." [...] writing for the Observer, Emily Mackay said, [...] "as the album's title suggests, Sundfør wishes to pour oil on the choppy waters of a weary world, and the warm clarity of her voice offers beautiful moments of respite." [...] MusicOMHs Sam Shepherd stated that the album [...] "will perhaps be a surprise for those who came to Sundfør via her last album, but they won't be disappointed. This is an album full of hidden depths, stark emotion, and most importantly, absolutely beautiful songs." ...|$|E
