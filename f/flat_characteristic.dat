50|$|Ronja however uses a feedbackless design {{where the}} PIN {{has a high}} working {{electrical}} resistance (100 kilohms) which together with the total input capacitance (roughly 8 pF, 5 pF PIN and 3 pF input MOSFET cascode) makes the device operate with a passband on a 6 dB/oct slope of low pass formed by PIN working resistance and total input capacitance. The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier. A surprisingly <b>flat</b> <b>characteristic</b> is obtained.
