A pre-requisite is to deposit them on as thin a support as possible. For this study graphene was chosen. Free-standing graphene was bombarded alone and with deposition of dispersed nanoparticles in a setup enabling bombardment at 0 ? and secondary ion (SI) detection in transmission in-line with the incident projectiles. C^ 1, 2 + 60 and Au^ 4 + 400 at impact energies of ? 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 keV/atom respectively were used as primary ions. The experiments were run as a sequence of single projectile impacts with each time separate recording of the SIs identified via ToF-MS. In order to improve the understanding of the graphene as a potential quasi-immaterial substrate for the deposition of sub-monolayer nanoparticles, the 1 -layer and 4 -layer graphene were impacted by the individual 25 and 50 keV C^ 1, 2 + 60 projectiles and negative SIs and secondary electrons (SEs) were collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction.</b> The yields of C? n (n ? 4) are above 10 % and decrease exponentially with n. The results are explained with the aid of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The ionization probability was estimated by comparing the SI yields of C? n to the yields of C 0 n from MD simulation. The ions come from the thermally excited rim of the impact hole damped by cluster fragmentation and electron detachment. The SE probability distributions are Poisson-like, and on average 3 thermal electrons are emitted per impact. The interaction of a 2 D projectile on a 2 D target is fundamentally different from that on a 3 D material. 1 -layer graphene was also impacted by the 440 - 540 keV Au 4 + 400 projectiles in both positive and negative ion modes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction.</b> The projectiles penetrated the graphene and the Au? 1 ? 3 fragment ions were observed as well as C? n. During the impact, ? 15 % of the initial kinetic energy is lost. The Au projectiles are neutralized when approaching the graphene, and then partially ionized again (positively and negatively) via electron tunneling from the hot rims of the impact hole on graphene. The projectiles obtain an internal energy of ? 500 eV (? 4900 K) after the impact. They undergo a ? 90 step fragmentation with the ejection of Au 1 atoms in the experimental time range of ? 0. 1 ?s. Individual free-standing 5 nm gold nanoparticles coated with dodecanethiol were deposited on graphene film and bombarded with Au^ 4 + 400 and C^ 1, 2 + 60. The graphene substrate contributed few SIs beyond m/z 120, facilitating the detection of moieties attached to the nanoparticles. Compared to reflection SIMS, transmission SIMS shows a ? 4 times higher effective yield of molecular ions from the dodecanethiol coating. The SI yields from Au^ 4 + 400 impact are ? 3 times higher than those from C^ 2 + 60 impact. The yield of the dodecanethiol molecular ion is 1. 0 ? 10 ^? 4 from the Au^ 4 + 400 bombardment and 3. 0 ? 10 ^? 5 from the C^ 2 + 60 bombardment. In this case, assuming the Au nanoparticles are perfectly coated by the dodecanethiol molecules, the limit of detection is ? 5 ? 10 ^ 4 dodecanethiol molecules with Au^ 4 + 400 bombardment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of flooding-based packet forwarding in a densely populated mobile ad hoc net-work. Specifically, we develop the probability distribution of hop count distance for a source–destination pair in the network, given that all nodes are roaming. The behavior of packet forwarding {{in such an environment}} is analogous to the ripples radiating from the source when one drops a stone into a pond. Due to node mobility, the number of hops traversed by each packet is not simply equal to the number of ripples from source to destination. In this paper, node mobility is represented as a growing circle centered at the destination node. The moving behavior of intermediate nodes can be ignored in a flooding-based ad hoc network with high node density since there is always a node available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> to forward packets. The analytical model is validated via simulations. We further demonstrate that based on the proposed analytical model, one can estimate the flooding cost and search latency of target location discovery commonly used in most exist-ing on-demand ad hoc routing protocols, and learn the impact of different flooding schemes on target discovery.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel single-bunch self-seeding scheme for generating highly monochromatic X-rays from a baseline XFEL undulator. Previous schemes {{made use of}} a four-crystal fixed-exit monochromator in Bragg geometry. In such monochromator the X-ray pulse acquires a cm-long path delay, which must be compensated. For a single-bunch self-seeding scheme this requires a long electron beam bypass, implying modifications of the baseline undulator configuration. To avoid this problem, a double bunch self-seeding scheme based on a special photoinjector setup was recently proposed. At variance, here we propose a new time-domain method of monochromatization exploiting a single crystal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction,</b> thus avoiding the problem of extra-path delay for the X-ray pulse. The method can be realized using a temporal windowing technique, requiring a magnetic delay for the electron bunch only. The proposed setup is extremely simple and composed of as few as two simple elements. These are the crystal and the short magnetic chicane, which accomplishes three tasks by itself. It creates an offset for crystal installation, it removes the electron micro-bunching produced in the first undulator, and it acts as a delay line for temporal windowing. Using a single crystal installed within a short magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, {{it is possible to}} decrease the bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL design down to 10 E- 5. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb the undulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of operation.

40|$|Secondary ion mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) {{with a massive}} cluster projectile and run in the event-by-event bombardment/detection mode {{has been applied to}} perform nanoscale analysis. Massive clusters, specifically Au_(400) ^(4 +), at hypervelocity feature efficient production of multiple secondary ions (SIs) desorbed from a nanometric volume per impact. The SIs from each projectile impact are collected and recorded as an individual event. Investigation of individual nano-objects with SIMS can thus be achieved by probing the objects one-at-a-time, avoiding issues due to ensemble averaging and neighboring effects. Presented here are experiments where individual nano-objects of two categories were examined with 520 keV Au_(400) ^(4 +) in the event-by-event mode. Biological nano-objects, Q? and M 13 bacteriophages were dispersed by drop-casting onto a nanostructured substrate. By compiling the events containing an ion characteristic of the object, mass spectra specific to the phages can be extracted. A further refinement is the exclusion of the events containing a substrate-specific ion to minimize interference from the substrate. For metallic nano-objects, a series of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) ranging from 2 - 50 nm was investigated. The AuNPs were dispersed and immobilized on silicon wafers. The results are the first experimental documentation of NP-size dependent SI yields. They can be significantly enhanced over those from bulk samples when projectile and NP characteristics are matched for efficient energy transfer. These observations point out the necessity of accurate data interpretation when dealing with nano-scaled objects. The capability of nano-domain analysis was demonstrated with fuel cell cathode materials consisting of pyrolized catalyst/carbon black mixtures. The coincidence methodology allowed to reveal variations in the chemical environment of the catalytically active sites at a nano-scale as a function of pyrolysis temperature. Additionally we could quantify the dispersion of the active sites on the carbon black, a measure providing a direction for future device optimization.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two {{different}} topics: High speed communication on twisted pair wires (digital subscriber lines) and low complexity multiuser detectors. The {{major part of}} this thesis concerns a technique for high speed communication over the telephone network called Very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line VDSL). VDSL is not standardized yet but {{it is intended to}} offer bit rates up to 52 Mbit per second on twisted-pair wires. An important problem in VDSL is crosstalk between wire pairs, especially Near End Cross Talk (NEXT). A novel duplex method, called Zipper, that mitigates NEXT is presented herein. Zipper is a flexible duplex method that has high duplex efficiency and offers compatibility with existing services. It is based on Discrete Multi Tone (DMT) modulation, and uses different subcarriers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two different <b>transmission</b> <b>directions.</b> <b>The</b> method relies on an additional cyclic extension to ensure orthogonality between <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>directions.</b> Zipper achieves best performance when all transmitters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> access network are synchronized, but it can also operate in an asynchronous mode with only a small loss in performance. Another important issue for VDSL is the problem with Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The copper wires can act as large antennas and hence can transmit and receive radio signals. Herein the problem of radio frequency signals interfering with VDSL systems (called RFI-ingress) is addressed. The proposed method for suppressing <b>the</b> RFI works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency domain of the DMT-receiver and can be used by any DMT-based VDSL system. By modeling the RFI and measuring the disturbance on some unmodulated subcarriers we can extrapolate and subtract the disturbance on all the other subcarriers. For a typical scenario with an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 30 dB without RFI, about 20 dB can be lost due to RFI, but with the presented RFI-canceller this SNR-loss is reduced to less than 1 dB. The last part of this thesis deals with low complexity multiuser detection in a direct sequence code division multiple access system. The Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detector (MLSD) gives very good performance but is known to be very computationally complex. The detector presented herein is a simple threshold detector that makes MLSD-decisions on some, but not necessarily all, bits. A pipelined structure of the detector is presented which is attractive from an implementation point of view, since it allows parallel processing of the data. Using a single-user matched filter detector as post processor, taking care of the previously undetected bits, a complete multiuser detector with very low complexity is achieved. This detector gives better performance than the decorrelator receiver for a limited number of simultaneous users, e. g. up to 25 users with a spreading factor of 127.

This paper describes a sensitivity analysis of the electric field sensor using optical modulator and methodologies for measuring conducted electromagnetic disturbances. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide precise measurement technologies for evaluating electromagnetic environment in vicinity of telecommunication equipment. For this purpose, sensitivity analyses of the electric field sensor, development of capacitive voltage probe for non-contact measurement and method for determining a <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> were carried out. In sensitivity analysis of the electric field sensor, first, the sensitivity calculation method by using equivalent circuit was evaluated. The parameters of the circuit were obtained theoretically and experimentally. The electric field sensor with designed parameter was made and its experimental characteristics were compared with theoretical one, in order to clarify main factor of sensitivity deviation. The results show that the difference between measured and calculated results depended on the value of capacitance and insertion loss of the sensor. However, the calculated result using measured parameters agreed with measured one. This means that the sensitivity of the sensor can be calculated by using its equivalent circuit. Secondly, method for controlling the optical bias angle was carried out. An optical bias angle is an important parameter that determines a driving point of the electric field sensor. The adjustment method by applying a stress to the end of the optical modulator’s substrate was examined theoretically and experimentally. As a result, it is shown that the optical bias angle can be adjusted with the refractive index change by a photo-elastic effect and the elongation of a waveguide by a stress. Moreover, narrow band resonance of the electric field sensor in frequency range from 1 to 100 MHz was examined by taking the piezoelectric effect into consideration, theoretically. The result clarified that the narrow-band resonance depends on the width of the substrate. Therefore, it is shown that the resonance disappeared by changing the width of the substrate along the longitudinal direction. For conducted disturbance measurements, voltage probe by measuring common-mode disturbances without touching conductor and determination method for <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> of conducted disturbances were developed and evaluated theoretically and experimentally. A capacitive voltage probe was developed for measuring common-mode voltage on a cable without contacting its conductor. The characteristics of the probe and measurement error of the probe were evaluated. The results show that the probe has flat sensitivity in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 30 MHz. Also, dependence of the cable configuration (e. g. radius, position in an electrode) was evaluated by using equivalent circuit. The results show that this probe can measure the conducted common-mode disturbances, and its characteristics can be calibrated by theoretical analysis or experimental calibration data. Therefore, characteristics of this probe are enough to measure the conducted disturbances. Finally, determination method for <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> of <b>the</b> conducted disturbances on the cable was developed and evaluated its validity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. A <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> of <b>the</b> conducted disturbance can be obtained by focusing on an active power calculated by measuring voltage and current, simultaneously. Measurement system was developed and evaluated validity of this method. The experimental results show that <b>transmission</b> <b>directions</b> of both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal waves can be obtained by measuring its active power. Moreover, this method was applied to EMC trouble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. The result shows that the source of the trouble can be determined by detecting <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> of <b>the</b> disturbance.

Finally, the asymmetric property is used to enhance the overall quality. Specifically, a high overall quality can be achieved by, for example, opportunistically switching to <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> with higher quality. Under asymmetric traffic conditions, weighted proportionally fair scheduling (WPFS), which is proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of downlink scheduling in a cellular network, is applied to <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> switching. Numerical results reveal that WPFS provides a high overall quality and that the quality ratio is similar to the offered traffic ratio...|$|R
50|$|In many respects, CH was a crude system, both {{in theory}} and in {{comparison}} to other systems of the era. This is especially true when CH is compared to its German counterpart, the Freya. Freya operated on shorter wavelengths, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2.5 to 2.3 m (120 to 130 MHz) band, allowing it to be broadcast from a much smaller antenna. This meant that Freya {{did not have to}} use the two-part structure of CH with a floodlight transmission, and could instead send its signal in a more tightly focused beam like a searchlight. This greatly reduced the amount of energy needed to be broadcast, as a much smaller volume was being filled with <b>the</b> <b>transmission.</b> <b>Direction</b> finding was accomplished simply by turning the antenna, which was small enough to make this relatively easy to arrange. Additionally, the higher frequency of the signal allowed higher resolution, which aided operational effectiveness. However, Freya had a shorter maximum range of 100 mi, and could not accurately determine altitude.|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{mechanical}} gears, {{a magnetic}} gear (MG) has many merits {{by virtue of}} its contactless feature, high efficiency and inherent overload protection. In this paper, a novel MG with intersecting shaft axes based on the flux modulation effect is proposed. Compared with previous MGs, <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> of <b>the</b> novel MG can be designed very flexibly and it also has good competitive edge <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> use of permanent magnets, which enables it to have a relatively high-torque density. The working principle and performance are validated by an example design using finite element method. The effects of the dimensional parameters on the torque performance are analyzed. It is also verified that the torque density can be further improved by adopting a flux concentration configuration in its rotor design. It is concluded from the torque per unit volume density performance that the novel MG is very promising as a substitute to conventional gears. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The jeweler's {{refractometer}} ofers {{a simple}} method {{of determining the}} refractive indices of any mineral having a single polished surface of at least I mm 2 to a precision of about 0. fi) 2. For some crystallographic orientations of the polished surface of anisotropic crystals, {{it is necessary to}} determine the angles the vibration directions of the measured refractive indices make with the polished surface. This is accomplished by viewing the refractometer scale through a rotatable polarizing filter on which <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>direction</b> is indicated. With the knowledge of these angles, it is possible to tell if a crystal is uniaxial or biaxial: in uniaxial crystals to distinguish ar from e and tell the optic sign, and in biaxial crystals to identify all three refractive indices and thus determine the optic sign. Similar measurements can be made on a single mineral grain in a polished thin section. Also the indices of refraction of immersion liquids can be quickly determined with the refractome-ter...|$|R
