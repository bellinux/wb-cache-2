(2) the higher thermal efficiency should reduce the overall capital cost of the reactor plant in dollars per kilowatt. (3) the cesium can be distilled out of the intermediate <b>fluid</b> <b>circuit</b> to leave it bone-dry, thus greatly reducing the time and cost of maintenance work (particularly for the steam generator).

40|$|Abstract Background End-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) confers a large health-care burden for the United States, and the {{morbidity}} associated with vascular access failure has stimulated research into detection of vascular access stenosis and low flow prior to thrombosis. We present data investigating {{the possibility of}} using differential pressure (ΔP) monitoring to estimate access flow (Q) for dialysis access monitoring, with the goal of utilizing micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors integrated within the shaft of dialysis needles. Methods A model of the arteriovenous graft <b>fluid</b> <b>circuit</b> was used to study the relationship between Q and the ΔP between two dialysis needles placed 2. 5 – 20. 0 cm apart. Tubing was varied to simulate grafts with inner diameters of 4. 76 – 7. 95 mm. Data were compared with values from two steady-flow models. These results, and those from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of ΔP as a function of needle position, were used to devise and test a method of estimating Q using ΔP and variable dialysis pump speeds (variable flow) that diminishes dependence on geometric factors and fluid characteristics. Results In the <b>fluid</b> <b>circuit</b> model, ΔP increased with increasing volume flow rate and with increasing needle-separation distance. A nonlinear model closely predicts this ΔP-Q relationship (R 2 > 0. 98) for all graft diameters and needle-separation distances tested. CFD modeling suggested turbulent needle effects are greatest within 1 cm of the needle tip. Utilizing linear, quadratic and combined variable flow algorithms, dialysis access flow was estimated using geometry-independent models and an experimental dialysis system with the pressure sensors separated from the dialysis needle tip by distances ranging from 1 to 5 cm. Real-time ΔP waveform data were also observed during the mock dialysis treatment, which may be useful in detecting low or reversed flow within the access. Conclusion With further experimentation and needle design, this geometry-independent approach may prove to be a useful access flow monitoring method. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} {{determine}} the yearly energy output of solar thermal systems, we developed a quick, reliable and low-cost short term test method (ISTT-procedure), basing on the adaptation of a dynamic, component based simulation model to transient measuring data from about 6 weeks. The method is especially helpful to quickly judge the fulfilment’s of contracts concerned with guaranteed solar results (GSR). On the experimental side, an autarkic wireless measuring station for the meteorological quantities has been developed, new surface temperature sensors have been constructed and ultrasonic volume flow gauges as well as a mobile magnetic inductive volume flow station have been applied. Thus expensive wiring and cutting off the <b>fluid</b> <b>circuits</b> can be avoided. For the dynamic evaluation procedure, we tested different simulation programs using the multiport store model with four free parameters and an extended matched flow collector model with eight free parameters including pipes and a heat exchanger. Criteria for a measuring sequence sufficient for a reliable parameter identification and experimental procedures for their realization have been deduced and the parameters were numerically identified from insitu-measuring sequences not exceeding 6 weeks. The ISTT- procedure allows to separate the influence of the operation conditions (weather and hot water demand) from the performance of the solar system.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{analysis of a}} cross flow heat exchanger with a new flow arrangement comprehending several tube rows. The thermal performance of the proposed flow arrangement is compared with the thermal performance of a typical counter cross flow arrangement that is used in chemical, refrigeration, automotive and air conditioning industries. The thermal performance comparison has been performed {{in terms of the}} following parameters: heat exchanger effectiveness and efficiency, dimensionless entropy generation, entransy dissipation number, and dimensionless local temperature differences. It is also shown that the uniformity of the temperature difference field leads to a higher thermal performance of the heat exchanger. In the present case this is accomplished thorough a different organization of the in-tube <b>fluid</b> <b>circuits</b> in the heat exchanger. The relation between the recently introduced "entransy dissipation number" and the conventional thermal effectiveness has been obtained in terms of the "number of transfer units". A case study has been solved to quantitatively to obtain the temperature difference distribution over two rows units involving the proposed arrangement and the counter cross flow one. It has been shown that the proposed arrangement presents better thermal performance regardless the comparison parameter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
