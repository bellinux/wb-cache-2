5|$|In 1964, {{attempts}} at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, 1964, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical {{assistance from the}} local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai Chai {{in the province of}} Cabo Delgado. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E

25|$|During Harris’ {{life the}} book was neither popular nor well-received critically, <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> obscurity for many years before being rediscovered {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century. The book has since been republished many times, with a number of commentaries, some rather poorly researched, even {{reporting}} Harris’ first name as John. In more recent times a freshly researched volume by historian Eileen Hathaway has been published which removes many of the older mistakes and contains a foreword by the author Bernard Cornwell, who used the memoir as a source for his Sharpe series, even basing a minor character on Harris, albeit with a very different career. Likewise in the Sharpe TV series, the actor Jason Salkey played a rifleman very loosely based on Benjamin Harris. Salkey later recorded an audiobook version of The Recollections of Rifleman Harris.|$|E

500|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} has no definite boundary, slowly becoming {{thinner and}} <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is {{contained within the}} first [...] of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.|$|E

500|$|Pictor is a {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, located between the star Canopus and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its name is Latin for painter, {{and is an}} abbreviation of the older name Equuleus Pictoris (the [...] "painter's easel"). Normally represented as an easel, Pictor was named by Abbé Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. The constellation's brightest star is Alpha Pictoris, a white main-sequence star around 97light-years away from Earth. Pictor also hosts RR Pictoris, a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova, reaching apparent (visual) magnitude 1.2 in 1925 before <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> obscurity.|$|E
500|$|... "Underneath the Stars" [...] {{features}} a [...] "'70s soul vibe," [...] {{courtesy of the}} use of a Rhodes piano, as well as synthetic record scratches, in order to the give the song an authentic aged sound. The song also incorporates Carey's usage of double voice, in which she sings the verses in a lower octave, and then sings the crescendo and climax in a higher register over it. Carey felt the additions were simple steps taken to further display a contemporary R groove, and pay homage to the style of Minnie Riperton, who was one of Carey's biggest vocal influences growing up. According to author Chris Nickson, the song has a soft sound, and [...] "a lot of texture" [...] and bass, showing a more creative side to Carey. While reviewing Daydream, Stephen Holden from The New York Times described the song's double voice, as well as its lyrical content: [...] "'Underneath the Stars,' in which all the voices are Ms. Carey's, achieves the same dissolving synergy between a lyric and entwining vocal lines as she sings: [...] "Beautifully and bittersweetly / You were <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of many film historians and aficionados, both {{at the time and}} subsequently, silent film had reached an {{aesthetic}} peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents. For instance, despite <b>fading</b> <b>into</b> relative obscurity once its era had passed, silent cinema is represented by eleven films in Time Outs Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll, held in 1995. The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film—not only in the United States, but also in the West as a whole—was 1929; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures (Pandora's Box , Zemlya , City Lights [...] ) and zero talkies in the Time Out poll. (City Lights, like Sunrise, was released with a recorded score and sound effects, but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a [...] "silent"—spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema.) The earliest sound film to place is the French L'Atalante (1934), directed by Jean Vigo; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is Bringing Up Baby (1938), directed by Howard Hawks.|$|E
