Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers <b>for</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.

Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV {{is believed to have}} originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century.

5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives.

In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women.
