5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until she found a use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is no justification for killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan admitted she could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed to warp in to that ship. The larva devoured <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, as she told Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E
