500|$|The sleeve is threaded, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with 72mm filters, but vignetting is severe with the sleeve in place. The construction is plastic although the lens' rear mount is metal. The distance meter is recessed inside a window, but no {{depth of field}} meter or infrared index is present. The 7/8" [...] zoom ring is made of raised rubber ridges and operates over a 75 degree turning radius. The <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> is similarly constructed with more closely spaced ridges and a 100 degrees of turning action. The ridges of both rings are parallel to the lens.|$|E
500|$|Another {{innovation}} {{of the era}} secured Panavision's leading position: the Auto Panatar {{camera lens}} for 35mm anamorphic productions. Early CinemaScope camera lenses were notoriously problematic in close-ups with an optical aberration that was commonly known as [...] "the mumps": a widening of the face due {{to a loss of}} anamorphic power as a subject approaches the lens. Because of the novelty of the new anamorphic process, early CinemaScope productions compensated for this aberration by avoiding tightly framed shots. As the anamorphic process became more popular, it became more problematic. Panavision invented a solution: adding a rotating lens element that moved in mechanical sync with the <b>focus</b> <b>ring.</b> This eliminated the distortion and allowed for natural close-up anamorphic photography. The Auto Panatar, released in 1958, was rapidly adopted, eventually making CinemaScope lenses obsolete. This innovation earned Panavision the first of its 15 Academy Awards for technical achievement. Soon the screen credit [...] "Filmed in Panavision" [...] (as if Panavision itself were a widescreen format) began appearing on motion picture screen credits.|$|E

50|$|Distance scale window: This {{feature is}} found on many EF lenses. This feature, while not a control or switch, {{is useful to}} the {{photographer}} for determining, or setting, the lens's focus distance. It is {{used in conjunction with}} the <b>Focusing</b> <b>ring.</b> When rotated, the distance scale will also rotate to show the changing focus distance. On some lenses the distance scale also has an infrared index. These are shown as red markings below the distance scale. This is used for making focus adjustments when the photographer is doing infrared photography, as lenses typically focus infrared light at a different point than visible light, and therefore achieving correct focus using visible light will result in an out-of-focus infrared image. To make an adjustment, first focus the subject, then turn the <b>Focusing</b> <b>ring</b> so it matches the corresponding infrared index mark.|$|R
