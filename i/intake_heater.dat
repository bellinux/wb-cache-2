5000|$|One {{vulnerability}} {{effected by}} icing that {{is associated with}} reciprocating internal combustion engines is the carburetor. As air is sucked through the carburetor into the engine, the local air pressure is lowered, which causes adiabatic cooling. Thus, in humid near-freezing conditions, the carburetor will be colder, and tend to ice up. This will block the supply of air to the engine, and cause it to fail. For this reason, aircraft reciprocating engines with carburetors are provided with carburetor air <b>intake</b> <b>heaters.</b> The increasing use of fuel injection—which does not require carburetors—has made [...] "carb icing" [...] less of an issue for reciprocating engines.|$|R
50|$|While Ruth and Candace mull {{over how}} to trim the benches to fit, Terry and Jeff focus on {{assembling}} the plumbing, which is initially correct even though neither had read the kit's instructions. However, Terry's fanaticism over using every part (even if the instructions state that not all parts would be needed) causes Terry to install valves and connections everywhere, which were not secured using glue. In the end, the hot water <b>intake</b> from the <b>heater</b> to the tub has a section travelling straight upwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} both the Bryce Canyon crash and the near-fatal Gallup {{incident}} was eventually traced to a design flaw. A cabin <b>heater</b> <b>intake</b> scoop was positioned {{too close to the}} number 3 alternate tank air vent. If flightcrews allowed a tank to be overfilled during a routine fuel transfer between wing tanks, it could lead to several gallons of excess fuel flowing out of the tank vent and then being sucked into the cabin heater system, which then ignited the fuel. This caused the fire which destroyed the United aircraft at Bryce Canyon and severely damaged the American aircraft that landed in flames at Gallup.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an integrated}} approach to model heterogeneous household {{water and energy}} use and their linkages. The approach considers variations in behavioral and technological water and energy use factors that affect U. S. indoor residential water and energy use for toilets, showers, faucets, clothes washers, and dishwashers. The study uses a recent, large, national, disaggregated household water use data set collected from 11 cities, as well as national energy data on water heater efficiency and setpoint/intake temperatures. First, probability distributions of water and energy use factors are identified and correlated. Then, Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate probability distributions for estimated household water and energy use. Finally, linear regressions are used to find the relative effects of water and energy factors on household energy use. Results show that water and energy distributions among households are skewed, with the largest 12 % of the users consuming 21 % and 24 % of water and energy, respectively. Water heater setpoint temperature followed by <b>intake</b> temperature, <b>heater</b> efficiency, shower hot water percentage, household size, shower flowrate, and faucet flowrate have the highest relative effect on household energy use and should be targeted to reduce household energy use. The approach improves prior homogenous and deterministic water-energy models and can help utilities select and size cost-effective, collaborative water and energy conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{potential}} for simultaneous improvement in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, controlled autoignition (CAI) combustion has been subject to continuous research {{in the last several}} years. At the same time, {{there has been a lot}} of interest in the use of alternative fuels in order to reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuels. Therefore, this experimental study has been carried out to investigate the effect of alcohol fuels on the CAI combustion process and on the resulting engine performance. The experimental work was conducted on an optical single cylinder engine with an air-assisted injector. To achieve controlled autoignition, residual gas was trapped in the cylinder by using negative valve overlap and an <b>intake</b> air <b>heater</b> was used to ensure stable CAI combustion in the optical engine. Methanol, ethanol and blended fuels were tested and compared with the results of gasoline. The combustion processes were analysed through total chemiluminescence images captured with a high speed camera equipped with an intensifier. In addition, the effect of spark discharge was investigated. The images show that CAI combustion of alcohol fuels was characterized with fast and early autoignition combustion compared with pure gasoline. Chemiluminescence of the gasoline fuel was most visible and it decreased with increasing percentage of oxygenated fuels. During the re-compression stroke, chemiluminescence images of the gasoline engine indicated the presence of oxidation reactions.

40|$|The {{backfilling}} and sealing of deposition galleries or {{holes and}} access galleries and shafts {{is an important}} part of nuclear waste underground repository design. Any opening created during the construction of the repository is a potential preferential pathway for water, gas and radionuclides migration, and has to be effectively sealed. Bentonite or bentonite-based mixtures have been proposed as backfill and sealing materials for their low permeability, high swelling capacity and high retention capacity. This work reports the results of two laboratory tests in which two different sealing materials were subjected to conditions similar to those in a repository: a high thermal gradient and hydration with host rock water (Figure 1). The materials are contained in cylindrical cells with a plane heater at the bottom and water supply through the top surface. The temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the materials are measured online during the tests by capacitive sensors placed at different positions. The water <b>intake</b> and the <b>heater</b> power are also measured online. In addition, cell B is instrumented with a ring load cell located on the top of the cell to determine the axial pressure generated during the test. In one of them the material used is MX 80 bentonite pellets (B) and in the other is a 65 / 35 sand/bentonite mixture (S/B).

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{was constructed}} to investigate what effects could be generated in an HCCI engine by altering {{the properties of}} the engine?s intake charge. The principle changes investigated were altering the spatial distribution of the fuel in the intake and adding thermal gradients to the charge. The primary goal of the work was to develop a method to separate the effects of the spatial stratification of the charge from the effects of the thermal gradients in the charge and to study both independently. The laboratory included faculties for measuring the exhaust emissions, recording cylinder pressure, and monitoring and controlling the many engine inlet and outlet parameters. Auto-ignition state was achieved by externally adding thermal energy to the <b>intake</b> charge utilizing <b>heaters</b> wrapped around the intake piping, this allowed us to generate an intake charge with a very uniform temperature distribution unlike an engine that uses exhaust rebreathing or recompression strategies. Intake temperatures in excess of 350 �C were achievable in this laboratory. Two fueling systems were developed for this work. One was located over two meters away from the inlet to enable thorough mixing and a homogeneous mixture. The other utilized the traditional fueling port to introduce a concentrated shot of fuel and keep it separated from the air as long as possible in order to minimize mixing. In order to separate the thermal and the spatial effects the fuel was heated up to the same temperature as the bulk of the inlet air. The goal was to ensure that the charge in the cylinder started the compression process with a known and controlled temperature. The level of stratification was controlled by manipulating the timing of the injection of the fuel. The results of these experiments validated the experimental setup and confirmed that consistent and repeatable results could be obtained. A series of experiments performed with spatial stratification of the fuel, as well as thermal stratification in the charge, showed that increasing thermal stratification shifted the window of acceptable intake temperatures, over which combustion could be achieved, to higher temperatures. The engine also emitted higher levels of NOx and CO as the stratification increased, but all other indicators were constant when reviewed {{as a function of the}} combustion efficiency. In this setup the premixed fueling system had the lowest window of intake air temperatures and generated the lowest pollutant emissions. A set of experiments conducted with only stratification of the fuel showed that the engine operated over the same set of intake air temperatures for both fueling methods and for all injection timings investigated. In these experiments the engine still emitted higher amounts of NOx and CO compared to the premixed system, but these emissions were lower in this setup than they were in the setup that also introduced thermal stratification. The spatial stratification did not alter the engine?s behavior, in terms of cylinder pressure. Over a range of speeds, air/fuel ratios, and fueling rates the effects of fuel stratification, generated in the intake system, only caused slight increases in the emissions of NOx and CO. While empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that stratification of the fuel does exist inside the cylinder, the results do not provide any evidence as to what level of stratification is actually generated. However, an optically accessible engine has been constructed and installed in the laboratory and will be used, in the near future, to quantify the level of stratification generated...|$|R
