50|$|Screw piles can be {{referred}} to as screw-piles, steel screw-in foundations, screw piers, <b>helical</b> <b>piles,</b> helical anchors, screw anchors, screw foundations and helical piers. Screw piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer Alexander Mitchell in a paper in Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal in 1848 - however, <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> had been used for almost a decade by this point. Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s as pile foundations for lighthouses, and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 screw-pile lighthouses were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of 2000 kN. Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.|$|E

40|$|<b>Helical</b> screw <b>piles</b> are {{a popular}} {{solution}} for relatively low-capacity, removable or recyclable foundations supporting road and rail signage or similar light structures. When specifying a <b>helical</b> screw <b>pile,</b> a designer must choose the active length and the helical plate spacing ratio, which {{are governed by}} the number, spacing {{and size of the}} individual helices.

A simple analytical model is developed and used {{to assess the impact of}} different design methodologies on immediate displacements under loading. A traditional ‘permissible stress' method is shown to be conservative, whereas modern ‘partial factor' methods are more economical and lead to greater immediate displacements for a given design load. Designers using modern ‘partial factor' approaches, such as Eurocode 7, might benefit from specifying a helical plate spacing ratio of less than 1 · 5 to maximise the stiffness of the response to axial loading and minimise the immediate displacements experienced upon application of working loads...|$|R

The failure capacity of <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> in this study was measured via an experimental research program that was carried out by Frustum Confining Vessel (FCV). FCV is a frustum chamber by approximately linear increase in vertical and lateral stresses along depth from top to bottom.

According to the achievements, axial uplift capacity of helical model piles is about equal to usual steel model piles that have the helixes diameter.

Nowadays, {{there is significant}} interest in using large-capacity <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> to support foundations that would be subjected to both dynamic and static loading. The main objectives of this thesis are to: investigate the dynamic response and impedances of large-capacity helical piles; develop an analysis methodology for their dynamic response; and investigate their static axial compression and lateral behaviour, considering installation effects on their dynamic and static performances. The thesis presents the first full-scale vertical and horizontal dynamic field testing program executed on large-capacity <b>helical</b> <b>piles,</b> which involved 190 full-scale field load tests on nine instrumented large-capacity <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> and two driven steel piles with different geometrical configurations installed in cohesive soils. Six piles were tested two weeks after installation and four piles were tested after allowing a recovery period of nine months following installation. One hundred and seventy six field experiments were conducted to evaluate the dynamic response characteristics of single <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> and driven piles under different levels of vertical and horizontal harmonic excitations. The effects of various parameters, namely: pile length, number of helix plates and inter-helix spacing, excitation intensity, and soil thixotropy on the dynamic response were investigated. The experimental results were compared to the theoretical predictions of the continuum theory considering linear and nonlinear approaches. Reasonable match {{was found between the}} predicted response using the nonlinear approach and the measured response for both vertical and horizontal vibrations. The results demonstrated the significant effects of pile installation on forming weak soil zone around the pile, which stiffened with time following installation. This stiffening was manifested in an average increase in pile stiffness of about 43 % and in pile damping of 25 to 90 % within a nine month period. In addition, the dynamic response of the <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> was {{similar to that of the}} driven piles. The load transfer mechanism of large-capacity <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> was found to be predominantly through the helical plates and pile toe end bearing. Based on the results of the pile load tests, it is proposed to define the ultimate load of <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> as the load that corresponds to pile head movement equal to the pile elastic deformation plus 3. 5 % of helix diameter. The <b>helical</b> <b>piles</b> displayed a superior axial performance with capacities higher than driven pile by about 17 to 85 % based on pile configurations.

The magnitude of uplift capacity increase, caused by the inclusion of one more helix, is influenced by the damaging effect of soil disturbance due to the pile installation. <b>Helical</b> <b>piles</b> are installed into soil by applying a torque to the upper end of the shaft by mechanical means, and during installation the soil traversed by the helical blades are sheared and displaced laterally and vertically, and consequently some soil properties and arrangement are modified. Centrifuge model experiments were carried out on scaled models of <b>helical</b> <b>piles,</b> with different dimensions, in sand to investigate the variability of the rate of capacity gain due to the addition of one more helix to a helical pile. Uplift loading tests were carried out on twelve different types of model piles installed in containers of dry sand prepared with two different densities.

It combines {{the efficiency of the}} tapered section, the competitive cost, effectiveness and durability of spun cast ductile iron with a rough surface and the construction advantages of <b>helical</b> <b>piles.</b> The system is installed using a fast, low vibration and reduced noise process. Seven instrumented piles including five SCDI tapered and two steel straight pipes were installed in sand using mechanical torque. The piles were subjected to cyclic and monotonic compression, uplift and lateral load tests. Different loading sequences were adopted to assess the effect of prior cyclic/monotonic loading on the piles’ performance. The installation torque was monitored and the resulting capacity-to-torque ratio was compared to the literature reported values. The compaction of the previously disturbed sand from the helix penetration due to the pile taper resulted in superior compressive behavior of the proposed system compared to the straight shaft piles. The tapered piles exhibited higher stiffness at lower displacements compared to the straight shafted piles and the helix increased their uplift resistance. In addition, tapered shafts enhanced the lateral stiffness and the helix provided fixation due to the passive bearing pressures on the helix surfaces, which further improved the lateral {{performance of}} the short <b>helical</b> <b>piles.</b> A three dimensional finite element model was established and calibrated using the experimental data.

40|$|Abstract — Scour is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} caused due to the erosive action of flowing stream on alluvial beds which removes the sediment around or near structures located in flowing water. It means the lowering of the riverbed level by water erosions such {{that there is a}} tendency to expose the foundations of a structure. It is the result of the erosive action of flowing water, excavating and carrying away material from the bed and banks of streams and from around the piers and abutments of bridges. Scour has been the main cause for failures of marine structures throughout the world. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review few previous studies related to scour. Many researchers have conducted various studies to predict the maximum depth and diameter of scour hole. Vertical piles have been generally used in flumes to investigate the effects of scour. In a few studies, techniques to reduce the scour depth have been employed by making use of splitter plates and collars on the <b>piles.</b> <b>Helical</b> wires or cables wrapped spirally around the pile to resemble a threaded pile have also been used to reduce the scour. With the use of different special techniques, the scour depth has been reported to reduce by modifying the flow field near the piles. Prediction of scour depth is difficult as there are many uncertainties associated with it. Various methods of protecting the erodible soils around foundations of marine structures have also been adopted and such methods sometimes prove costly. It is therefore felt that more studies are still required to predict the scour depth effectively and also to find cost effective ways to reduce the scour...|$|R
