40|$|In the Vehicle Routing Problem with <b>Deliveries,</b> Selective Pickups <b>and</b> Time Windows, {{the set of}} {{customers}} is the union of <b>delivery</b> customers <b>and</b> pickup customers. A fleet of identical capacitated vehicles based at the depot must perform all <b>deliveries</b> <b>and</b> profitable pickups while respecting time windows. The objective is to minimize routing costs, minus the revenue associated with the pickups. Five variants of the problem are considered according to the order imposed on <b>deliveries</b> <b>and</b> pickups. An exact branch-and-price algorithm is developed for the problem. Computational results are reported for instances containing up to 100 customers.

5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned}} to the field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E

A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> filtration systems would have to be in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir would have to be drained by 2035.|$|E

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
