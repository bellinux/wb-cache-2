This paper {{looks at a}} 3 -zone multipoint LDI concept developed by Parker Hannifin Corporation. The concept was tested in a flame-tube test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. Due to test facility limitations, such as inlet air temperature and pressure, the flame-tube test {{was not able to}} cover the full set of engine operation conditions. Three NOx correlation equations were developed based on assessing NOx emissions dependencies on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> (P 3), inlet air temperature (T 3), and fuel air equivalence ratio () to estimate the NOx emissions at the unreachable high engine power conditions. As the results, the NOx emissions are found to be a strong function of combustion inlet air temperature and fuel air equivalence ratio but a weaker function of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> With these three equations, the NOx emissions performance of this injector concept is calculated as a 66 % reduction relative to the ICAO CAEP- 6 standard using a 55 : 1 pressure-ratio engine cycle. Uncertainty in the NOx emissions estimation increases as the extrapolation range departs from the experimental conditions. Since maximum <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> tested was less than 50 % of the full power engine <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> a future experiment at higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions is needed to confirm the NOx emissions dependency on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> on the surface of BrÅnemark titanium abutment cylinders. Materials and Methods : Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results : A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy Jet system removed machining marks to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> of 60 psi caused removal of machining marks to a greater degree than an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> causing more removal of machining marks than the higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> Conclusions : Under the experimental conditions tested, neither of the two systems tested seemed to cause significant abrasion of the surface of titanium abutment cylinders...|$|E

Combustion dynamic data were measured at different engine operational conditions up to <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature of 24. 13 bar and 828 K, respectively. In this study, the effects of acoustic cavity resonance, precessing vortex core (PVC), and non-uniform thermal expansion on the dynamic noise spectrum are identified by comparing the dynamic data that collected at various combustor inlet conditions along with combustor geometric calculations.

This research was dedicated toward measuring the potential of a new hybrid seal design between a two-bladed PDS and a metal mesh element, which is used as the exit blade of this PDS. The goals were to reduce leakage of the PDS, enhance damping and counteract the negative stiffness of the PDS. To achieve these goals, two sets of experiments namely, the no-air and with-air experiments were conducted on a static test rig. The first set was designed to evaluate the effect of varying the clamping force, the metal mesh density and the amplitude of vibration of the seal journal on the metal mesh dynamic response. The second set was designed to check the effect of varying these three parameters in addition to the effect of varying the inlet pressure to the seal. The performance of the new seal will be evaluated by extracting the rotordynamic coefficients for each experimental setup and compare them to those of the PDS. Two methods were used for extracting the rotordynamic coefficients namely, the classical goo-curve fitting method and a nonlinear regression model.

The problem analysis is presented in three sections. The first section presents the normal operating temperatures of a Diesel engine at both full and less than full-power. The second section includes an analysis of effects of increasing the inlet air temperature under conditions where less than full-power is used. Finally, the effects of reduced inlet pressure on low-power operation are analyzed in section three. The engine {{used in this analysis}} is a one-cylinder engine operating on the four-stroke cycle.

Recovering energy from low grade energy sources such as waste heat {{is one of the}} methods for improving the performance of thermodynamic cycles. The objective of this work was to achieve long-term steady state operation of a Free-Piston Linear Expander (FPLE) and to compare the FPLE with the currently existing expander types for use in low temperature energy recovery systems. A previously designed FPLE with a single piston, two chambers, and linear alternator was studied and several modifications were applied on the sealing and over expansion. An experimental test bench was developed to measure the inlet and outlet temperatures, inlet and outlet pressures, flow rate, and voltage output. A method of thermodynamic analysis was developed by using the first and second law of thermodynamics with air as the working fluid. The experimental tests were designed to evaluate the performance of the FPLE with varying parameters of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> inlet air temperature, and electrical resistance. The initial and steady-state operation of the FPLE were successfully achieved. An uncertainty analysis was conducted on the measured values to determine the accuracies of the calculated parameters.

A simple and low-cost instrument that non-intrusively measures the real-time fuel-to-air ratio (FAR) in a gas turbine combustor has been developed. The device uses a dual wavelength laser absorption technique to measure the concentration of most hydrocarbon fuels such as jet fuel, methane, propane, etc. The device can be configured to use fiber optics to measure the local FAR inside a high pressure test rig without the need for windows. Alternatively, the device can readily be used in test rigs that have existing windows without modifications. An initial application of this instrument was to obtain time-resolved measurements of the FAR in the premixer of a lean premixed prevaporized (LPP) combustor at <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> and temperatures as high as 17 atm at 800 K, with liquid JP- 8 as the fuel.

The optimization results show that working at fully humidified air at the inlet is not always a good solution especialy for low air mass flow rates because of the high level of air stoechiometry to avoid flooding of the polymer membrane. On the other hand, it is better to work at fully humidified air at the inlet at high air mass flow rates.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the energy performance of an air vortex cooling tube under variations of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> properties, with three independent experimental tests validated through the energy balance in the device. The experimental analysis includes the following variations of the input conditions: First, the effect of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> to the vortex tube, focused on the analysis of temperature variations in the output cold stream and in the cooling capacity when the cold flow fraction varies. Second, we studied <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature variations to the vortex tube under different cold flow fractions, which is an analysis not found in the literature. And finally, is studied the performance of the vortex tube when the insulation is provided or in absence of insulation...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} in a large commercial greenhouse equipped with a fan and pad evaporative cooling system and a half-shaded plastic roof. Experimental measurements were carried out at four different locations inside the greenhouse: (i) next to the cooling pads, (ii) 15 m away from the cooling pads (unshaded section), (iii) 45 m away from the cooling pads (shaded section) and (iv) before the extracting fans. The experimental results showed strong climate heterogeneity along the air stream from cooling pads to extracting fans. The overall efficiency of the system was quite high (~ 80 %) and in combination with the dry and warm outside climate conditions enabled the air to enter the greenhouse with a temperature even 10 °C lower than that of outside air temperature. However, due to the long air path through the greenhouse, air exits the greenhouse even 8 °C warmer than the <b>inlet</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Air</b> vapour <b>pressure</b> deficit varied from 0. 5 kPa (after the cooling pads) to 2 kPa (extracting fans). Transpiration rate was found larger at the second (shaded) part of the greenhouse mainly due the higher vapour pressure deficit found at this section of the greenhouse. Crop-to-air temperature difference was smaller at {{the second part of the}} greenhouse (45 m) indicated that the crop in this part was cooler than in the first one as a result of the higher transpiration rate at this section...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Diesel engines {{become popular}} {{from this point}} of view because of their high thermal efficiency. However, new and {{developing}} technologies are expected to lower their emission levels. Atomization of the fuel has a vital importance in order to control heat release rate and exhaust emission during combustion. With the known injection devices, atomization of the fuel is realized with high pressure systems such as common rail direct injectors (CRD) which operate at pressures exceeding 1300 bar. However, atomization of the fuel by simply increasing injection pressure can create cavitation erosion which may lead to mechanical failure of the nozzle. Utilization of air in diesel engine injectors will increase fuel atomization, provides more complete combustion of any diesel fuel consumed, enhance fuel economy and results in lower engine emissions. Therefore the aim of this study is to design a special injection device for use in a diesel engine which improves combustion by mixing air and fuel inside itself at optimum ratio. Proper <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> was determined for favorable diesel air mixing by investigation of the flow behavior in a newly designed injection device with the help of computational fluid dynamics based software. Three different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pressures</b> (20, 30 and 40 bar) are simulated and the contours of turbulence intensity, velocity and volume fraction of diesel fuel are discussed, and compared with each other...|$|R
