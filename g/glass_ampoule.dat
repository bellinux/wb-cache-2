50|$|In January 1976, {{a patent}} was issued for the Chemiluminescent Signal Device, with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons {{listed as the}} inventors (Patent 3,933,118). This patent {{recommended}} a single <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the signal device {{so it could be}} thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today.|$|E

Another variety of prank stink bomb comprises two bags, one smaller and inside the other. The inner one contains a liquid and the outer one a powder. When the inner one is ruptured by squeezing it, the liquid reacts with the powder, producing hydrogen sulfide, which expands and bursts the outer bag, releasing an unpleasant odor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{packaging}} injection drugs. Glass has important characteristics that allow it to be widely used in fabrication of recipients for drugs and other sterile substances. However, contamination of solutions with glass microparti-cles on breaking open <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules,</b> the presence of metals, percutaneous injury, and biological contamination justify the need of educational materials to orient the manipulation of <b>ampoules.</b> Contents: <b>Glass</b> microparticles generated in the snap-opening of ampoules, as well as metals that contaminate their contents can be aspirated and injected through several routes. Exogenous contaminations by glass and metals can reach several sites in the organism. They trigger organic reactions that may give rise to injuries. Opening ampoules can expose professionals to the risk of percutaneous injuries. These lesions increase the biological risk as they are the gateway for viruses and bacteria. Ampoules opening systems (VIBRAC and OPC) have been developed to reduce the incidence of such accidents. Alternative materials to glass may represent an interesting strategy to increase safety.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{accurate}} and reliable method {{for the detection}} of wall perforation during the excimer-laser micro-drilling of <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> and vials. The method is based on the detection of shock waves generated in the air during the drilling process using a laser-beam deflection probe.

We show that a significant change in the signalćs amplitude is observed when the wall of a liquid-filled ampoule is perforated and the exit process point is in contact with the liquid, and that this signal change can serve as an indicator of wall perforation. We have verified this optodynamic method by examining the processed holes using optical and electron microscopy as well as with a non-destructive gas-leakage test method.
