50|$|Laminated vs Honyaki: From a {{strictly}} <b>heat</b> <b>treat</b> and microscopy point of view, {{there should be}} no difference between a laminated and honyaki steel with the same observed structure and heat threat process, but the <b>heat</b> <b>treat</b> necessarily differs, and many users say there is benefit to honyaki. Many users also prefer laminated blades for ease of maintenance ,sharpening feel, cost, and toughness. Many blacksmiths prefer laminated blades because at the minimum, they are easier to produce. At the highest levels they have core steel of comparable hardness and sharpness and are not necessarily easier to make due to the skill to forge weld at lower temperatures, with minimal loss of carbon, less flux and iron powder, and with minimal scars while stretching out the laminate. Pattern welding (suminagashi) requires its own skill as well and can produce a stiffer awase knife with less distortion during use and sharpening.|$|E
