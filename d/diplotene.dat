40|$|The family Araneidae is {{the third}} largest among spiders and the third most studied from a cytogenetical point of view. In spite of this, only 2 % of all araneids have been karyotyped. The {{majority}} of araneids analyzed possess 2 n = 24 chromosomes in males; however, the study of additional species could reveal unusual karyotype characteristics. Thus, {{the aim of this}} work is to analyze chromosomally, for the first time, six species belonging to three araneid genera from Brazil. The specimens of Alpaida leucogramma (White 1841), Alpaida truncata (Keyserling 1865), Alpaida veniliae (Keyserling 1865), Parawixia kochi (Taczanowski 1873), Parawixia velutina (Taczanowski 1878) and Wagneriana sp. were collected in Parque Nacional de Ilha Grande and in the municipality of Rio Claro. The gonads were treated with colchicine and hypotonic solution before fixation with Carnoy I solution. The results were 2 n male = 24 (11 II+X(1) X(2)) in A. leucogramma and P. velutina, and 2 n male =- 22 (10 II+X(1) X(2)) in A. truncata, A. veniliae, P. kochi and Wagneriana sp.

Chromosomes transform into the lampbrush form during the <b>diplotene</b> stage of meiotic prophase I due to an active transcription of many genes. They are highly extended meiotic half-bivalents, each consisting of 2 sister chromatids. Lampbrush chromosomes are clearly visible even in the light microscope, where they are seen to be organized {{into a series of}} chromomeres with large chromatin loops extended laterally. Amphibian and avian lampbrush chromosomes can be microsurgically isolated from oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle) with either forceps or needles.|$|E

5000|$|Mitotic germ stem cells, oogonia, divide by mitosis {{to produce}} primary oocytes {{committed}} to meiosis. Unlike sperm production, oocyte production is not continuous. These primary oocytes begin meiosis but pause in <b>diplotene</b> of meiosis I {{while in the}} embryo. All of the oogonia and many primary oocytes die before birth. After puberty in primates, small groups of oocytes and follicles prepare for ovulation by advancing to metaphase II. Only after fertilization is meiosis completed. Meiosis is asymmetric producing polar bodies and oocytes with large amounts of material for embryonic development. The mutation frequency of female mouse germ line cells, like male germ line cells, is also {{lower than that of}} somatic cells. [...] Low germ line mutation frequency appears to be due, in part, to elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes that remove potentially mutagenic DNA damages. Enhanced genetic integrity may be a fundamental characteristic of germ line development.|$|E
50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the <b>diplotene</b> stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|E
5000|$|That mating in N. crassa {{can only}} occur between strains of {{different}} mating type {{suggests that some}} degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection. In haploid multicellular fungi, such as N. crassa, meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage {{is one of their}} most complex processes. The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation. In N. crassa, recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations. [...] These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores). The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed pachytene or <b>diplotene).</b> [...] The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435 (about 4% {{of the total number of}} 9,730 genes). Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see Complementation (genetics)).|$|E
5000|$|In females, meiosis {{occurs in}} cells known as oocytes (singular: oocyte). Each oocyte that initiates meiosis divides twice, unequally in each case. The first {{division}} produces a daughter cell that will undergo a second division, {{and a much}} smaller [...] "polar body" [...] that is extruded {{from the surface of}} the cell and does not divide further. Following Meiosis II, a [...] "second polar body" [...] is extruded, and the single remaining haploid cell enlarges to become an ovum. Since the first polar body normally disintegrates rather than dividing again, meiosis in female mammals results in three products, the oocyte and two polar bodies. However, before these divisions occur, these cells stop at the <b>diplotene</b> stage of meiosis I and lie dormant within a protective shell of somatic cells called the follicle. Follicles begin growth at a steady pace in a process known as folliculogenesis, and a small number enter the menstrual cycle. Menstruated oocytes continue meiosis I and arrest at meiosis II until fertilization. The process of meiosis in females occurs during oogenesis, and differs from the typical meiosis in that it features a long period of meiotic arrest known as the dictyate stage and lacks the assistance of centrosomes.|$|E
5000|$|Oscillations in Cyclin E-Cdk2 {{activity}} are modulated via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Expression of cyclin E is activated by E2F transcription factors that {{were shown to}} be required for endoreplication. [...] Recent work suggests that observed oscillations in E2F and cyclin E protein levels result from a negative-feedback loop involving Cul4-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of E2F. [...] Post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity involves Ago/Fbw7-mediated proteolytic degradation of cyclin E [...] and direct inhibition by factors such as Dacapo and p57. True endomitosis in the anther tapetum of the liliaceous plant Eremurus is described. The nuclear membrane does not disappear, but during metaphase the chromosomes are condensed, often considerably more than in normal mitosis. When the pollen mother cells (PMCs) go through the last premeiotic mitosis, the tapetal cells have one diploid nucleus which divides while the cell remains undivided. The two diploid nuclei may undergo an endomitosis and the resulting tetraploid nuclei a second endomitosis. An alternative pathway is an ordinary mitosis-again without cell division instead {{of one of the}} endomitotic cycles. The cytological picture in the tapetum is further complicated by restitution in anaphase and fusion of metaphase and anaphase groups during mitosis, processes which could give rise to cells with one, two, or three nuclei, instead of the expected two or four. No sign of the so-called [...] "inhibited" [...] mitosis is seen in these tapetal cells. When the PMCs are in leptotene-zygotene, very few tapetal nuclei are in endomitosis. When the PMCs have reached <b>diplotene,</b> almost 100% of cells which are not in interphase show an endomitotic stage.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the meiotic {{development}} in the PMC of the three larch species Larix: decidua, L. leptolepis, and L. sibirica was studied. Emphasis was paid {{to the analysis of}} the conditions of importance for breaking the dormancy of the <b>diplotene</b> stage as well as the factors responsible for the initiation of further development from <b>diplotene.</b> On the basis of a detailed analysis of meiosis in a few clones 1966 - 67 as well as in larger number of clones in 1967 - 68, the following characteristics of the meiotic development of the three species were observed: L. decidua: <b>Diplotene</b> is reached relatively early. The initiation of the further development from <b>diplotene</b> takes place late. L. leptolepis: <b>Diplotene</b> is reached relatively late. The initiation of the further development takes place somewhat earlier than in L. decidua. L. sibirica: <b>Diplotene</b> is reached early. The initiation of the further development from <b>diplotene</b> takes place early, even during the autumn. During the course of the investigation irregularities appeared frequently. For an understanding of the origin of the irregularities a distinction was made between different categories. Chromosomal irregularities and irregularities in cell division were the two main categories. The appearance of the various irregularities was demonstrated by photomicrographs. In L. decidua and L. leptolepis stickiness and degeneration predominated, whereas polyspory, stickiness and degeneration occurred most frequently in L. sibirica. It was shown that irregularities did not appear until sensitive cells were exposed to low temperatures. All phases of active division during meiosis were believed to be highly sensitive to low temperatures. An attempt was made to obtain quantitative relations between low temperatures and sensitive cells on one hand and irregularities on the other hand. Good approaches for such relations were observed in several cases. However, the exact temperature response could not be revealed, owing to the impossibility of achieving an artificial control of the outdoor temperature conditions. From this investigation, as well as previous ones, the prerequisites for proper pollen formation could be stated in the follom-ing way: 1. Reaching of <b>diplotene</b> before frost appears during autumn. 2. Stability of the resting <b>diplotene</b> stage to short temperature fluctuations around O°C (- 5 - + 5 °C). 3. Rapid reaching of the tetrad stage when development from <b>diplotene</b> is initiated. On this basis it could be concluded that the probability of obtaining proper pollen formation was not promising as L. leptolepis did not fulfil any of these requirements, whereas L. sibirica only fulfilled the first one. For the Stockholm area the best chance of obtaining a high pollen fertility should be given by L. decidua...|$|E
40|$|Arrest of premeiotic S phase by high {{temperature}} and light causes the meiotic cell cycle {{time to become}} shortened by 4 h after release of the arrest. Genetical and cytological evidence shows that <b>diplotene</b> is drastically reduced from 4 - 5 h to less than 1 h. Cycloheximide (50 fig/ml) treatment of early and late <b>diplotene</b> cells in normal cultures prevents the meiotic divisions even though the chromosomes are condensed. The same treatment given within 1 h of meta-phase I allows both divisions to be completed but fails to allow sporulation. This is interpreted to mean that the cellular programme for meiotic division (division programme) is made during <b>diplotene.</b> In the arrest-release cultures, however, the division programme is made during pachytene. This finding is interpreted to mean that the cellular programme in meiosis is prepared {{one step at a}} time. When the nuclear cycle is arrested, the cytoplasmic programmes continue. As a result, the division programme is precociously induced at pachytene. Since the <b>diplotene</b> programme is complete, the cells proceed directly from pachytene into metaphase I with the <b>diplotene</b> stage drastically reduced. Cold treatment at 5 °C at pachytene temporarily suspends the progress of meiosis and hence prolongs the pachytene stage. This prolongation causes an increase in recombination frequency.

40|$|In the rat ovary, germ {{and somatic}} cells become {{organized}} into primordial follicles 48 - 72 h after birth. Although several genes have {{been implicated in}} the control of early follicular growth, less {{is known about the}} factors involved in the formation of primordial follicles. Using the method of differential display of mRNAs, we found several genes differentially expressed at the time of follicular assembly. One of them encodes synaptonemal complex protein- 1 (SCP 1), a core component of the protein complex that maintains recombining chromosomes together during prophase I of the first meiotic division in germ cells. This association, evident during the pachytene stage, ends when chromosomal desynapsis begins in the <b>diplotene</b> stage at the end of prophase I. Oocytes become arrested in the diplotene/dictate stage before becoming enclosed into primordial follicles, suggesting that oocytes must complete meiotic prophase I before becoming competent to direct follicle assembly. We now show that attainment of the <b>diplotene</b> stage results in follicular formation. In developing rat ovaries, SCP 1 mRNAexpression is confined to oocytes and decreases precipitously within 24 h after birth, preceding the organization of primordial follicles. The premature loss of SCP 1, achieved via treatment with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting SCP 1 mRNA, resulted in more oocytes reaching the <b>diplotene</b> stage, as evidenced by a {{decrease in the number of}} oocytes containing germ cell nuclear antigen- 1 (a nuclear protein whose expression ceases in <b>diplotene)</b> and an increase in the number of oocytes expressing MSY 2 (a cytoplasmic Y box protein expressed in oocytes that have become arrested in <b>diplotene).</b> SCP 1 -deficient ovaries exhibited an increased number of newly formed follicles, suggesting that completion of meiotic prophase I endows oocytes with the ability to orchestrate follicular assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{investigate}} whether a decrease of nitric oxide (NO) level is beneficial for sponateous resumptiom of meiosis in diplotene-arrested oocytes cultured in vitro. For this purpose, diplotene-arrested oocytes were collected from ovary of immature female rats after a single subcutaneous injection of 20 IU pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropins (PMSG) for 48 h. In vitro effects of S-nitroso-l-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP; an NO donor) and aminoguanidine (AG; an inducible NOS [iNOS] inhibi-tor), intracellular NO, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Cdc 25 B, Thr- 14 /Tyr- 15 and Thr- 161 phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase- 1 (CDK 1), and cyclin B 1 levels were analyzed. The SNAP inhibited spontaneous meiotic resumption form <b>diplotene</b> arrest in a concentration-dependent manner, while AG-induced meiotic resumption form <b>diplotene</b> in 0. 1 mmol/L 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) -treated oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. The intracellular NO as well as cGMP levels were decreased significantly during spontaneous meiotic resumption from <b>diplotene</b> arrest. The reduction of Cdc 25 B expression level {{was associated with the}} accumulation of Thr- 14 /Tyr- 15 phosphorylated CDK 1 level. However, Thr- 161 phosphorylated CDK 1 as well as cyclin B 1 levels were reduced significantly during meiotic resumption from <b>diplotene</b> arrest. Taken together, these data suggest that the inhibition of iNOS expression leads to a decrease of NO and cGMP levels thereby decreasing Cdc 25 B level. The reduced CDC 25 B level leads to accumulation of Thr- 14 /Tyr- 15 phosphorylated CDK 1 level. As a result, Thr- 161 phosphorylated CDK 1 as well as cyclin B 1 levels are decreased leading to maturation-promoting factor (MPF) inactivation.

In the European larch the <b>diplotene</b> stage lasts approximately 5 months {{and it is possible}} to divide it into several substages and to observe each of them in details. The <b>diplotene</b> stage is a period of intensive microsporocyte growth associated with the synthesis and accumulation of different RNA and proteins. Larch microsporocytes display changes in chromatin morphology during this stage, alternating between 4 short stages of chromatin condensation (contraction) and 5 longer diffusion (relaxation) stages. The occurrence of a <b>diplotene</b> diffusion stage has been observed in many plant species. Interestingly, they have also been observed during spermiogenesis and oogenesis in animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether chromatin relaxation during the <b>diplotene</b> is accompanied by the synthesis and maturation of mRNA. The results reveal a correlation between the diffusion and chromatin decondensation, transcriptional activity. We also found decreasing amount of poly(A) mRNA synthesis in the consecutive diffusion stages. During the early diffusion stages, mRNA is intensively synthesized. In the nuclei large amounts of RNA polymerase II, and high levels of snRNPs were observed. In the late diffusion stages, the synthesized mRNA is not directly subjected to translation but it is stored in the nucleus, and later transported to the cytoplasm and translated. In the last diffusion stage, the level of poly(A) RNA is low, but that of splicing factors is still high. It appears that the mRNA synthesized in early stages is used during the <b>diplotene</b> stage and is not transmitted to dyad and tetrads. In contrast, splicing factors accumulate and are most likely transmitted to the dyad and tetrads, where they are used after the resumption of intense transcription. Similar meiotic process were observed during oogenesis in animals. This indicates the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of chromatin-based regulation of gene expression during meiotic prophase I...|$|E
40|$|This study reports {{observations}} on fine-structural {{changes in the}} nucleus of the oocyte in hamsters during the establishment of the primordial (unilaminar) follicle at 7 to 12 days after birth. Following pachytene, the nuclei at early <b>diplotene</b> contain simple chromosomal cores surrounded by a sheath of fibrillo-granular material symmetrically disposed in the form of lateral projections and loops. From 9 days onwards increasing numbers of the oocytes show nuclei lacking such chromosomal threads: instead, they contain randomly disposed, condensed fibrillar clumps with associated dense knots of material, and prominent aggregations of 25 - 30 -nm granules. This second nuclear form is assumed by all oocytes examined at 11 and 12 days and appears to be the definitive <b>diplotene</b> phase. These changes in the appearance of the nuclear chromatin are discussed in the light of those found in oocytes of other species, and it is concluded that the hamster <b>diplotene</b> phase consists of a transitory 'compact ' or uniform lampbrush stage, followed by a definitive dictyate condition like that in the rat, but with markedly differential condensation or extreme diffusion of lateral loops. This conclusion is examined in relation to findings which report a marked increase in the sensitivity of hamster oocytes to X-radiation {{at the time that the}} observed changes in nuclear configuration are taking place. The combined observations support the hypothesis that the dictyate stage in rodent oocytes represents a modified <b>diplotene</b> phase in which the high degree of spatial diffusion of components of chromosomes of the lampbrush type results in a reduced capacity for repair following exposure to ionizing radiations...|$|E

The stage of arrest in cyclin A 1 -deficient mice is distinct from the arrest seen in spermatocytes that are deficient in its putative catalytic partner Cdk 2, which occurs much earlier in pachytene. The arrest in cyclin A 1 -deficient spermatocytes is also accompanied by an unusual clustering of centromeric heterochromatin. Consistent with a possible defect in the centromeric region, immunofluorescent staining of cyclin A 1 protein shows localization {{in the region of}} the centromere. Phosphorylation of histone H 3 at serine 10 in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which normally occurs in late <b>diplotene,</b> is reduced in spermatocytes from heterozygous Ccna 1 +/− testes and completely absent in spermatocytes with no cyclin A 1 protein. Concomitantly, the levels of pericentromeric aurora B kinase, known to phosphorylate histone H 3 during meiosis, are partially reduced in spermatocytes from testes of heterozygous mice and further reduced in homozygous null spermatocytes. These data suggest a critical and concentration-dependent function for cyclin A 1 in the pericentromeric region in late <b>diplotene</b> of meiosis, perhaps in assembly or function of the passenger protein complex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the identification of}} two major components of the lateral elements of synaptonemal complexes of the rat by immunocytochemical techniques. We prepared monoclonal antibodies against synaptonemal complexes (SCs) by immunization of mice with purified SCs. One of these antibodies, II 52 F 10, reacts with a 30 and a 33 kDa polypeptide, which are major components of purified SCs. Using this antibody, we studied the localization of its antigens light microscopically, {{by means of the}} indirect immunoperoxidase technique, as well as ultrastructurally, by means of the immunogold labeling technique. The immunolocalization was carried out on whole-mount preparations of lysed spermatocytes. The antibody reacts with paired as well as unpaired segments of zygotene, pachytene and <b>diplotene</b> SCs. In light microscopic preparations, the attachment plaques, particularly those of late pachytene and <b>diplotene</b> SCs, also appear to react strongly. In electron micrographs the lateral elements in paired as well as unpaired segments could be seen to react. No reaction was observed in the attachment plaques; however, in late pachytene and <b>diplotene</b> SCs the swollen terminal segments of the lateral elements did react with the antibody. Thus, we conclude that a 30 and a 33 kDa polypeptide make part of the lateral elements of synaptonemal complexes of the ra...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomes from oocytes of the newt Triturus cristatus carnifex {{have been}} photo-graphed {{by means of}} the {{electron}} microscope. These chromosomes are shown to con-. sist of single axial filaments, approximately 200 A wide, with 'lamp-brush ' loops attached at intervals along their lengths. Good fixation of the lamp-brush loops has not yet been obtained. These chromosomes are attached in pairs to their homologues at points which, in the past, have been considered to be chiasmata: it has been assumed that the stage is <b>diplotene</b> of the first meiotic division. The singleness of the chromo-some strands which we have observed is at variance with observations of <b>diplotene</b> in other material {{by means of the}} light microscope. SINCE the electron microscope was introduced as a tool for the study ofthe fine structure of biological specimens {{there have been a number}} o...|$|E
40|$|Resumption of meiosis from <b>diplotene</b> arrest {{during the}} first meiotic {{prophase}} in vertebrate oocytes is universally controlled by MPF, a heterodimer of Cdk 1 and cyclin B. Activation of MPF depends on the withdrawal of Cdk 1 inhibition by Wee 1 /Myt 1 kinase {{on the one hand}} and the activation of Cdk 1 by Cdc 25 phosphatase on the other. It is relevant to know whether both these pathways are necessary to rescue <b>diplotene</b> arrest or if either one of them is sufficient. In MIH (17 a, 20 b dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 - one) incubated perch (Anabas testudineus) oocytes we have examined these possibilities. Perch oocyte extract following MIH incubation showed a significant increase in Myt 1 phosphorylation from 12 to 16 hr indicating its progressive deactivation. MIH induced Mos expression markedly increased at 16 hr effecting 95...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy {{has been used}} to study the chromosomes found in the early <b>diplotene</b> oocytes of Xenopus laevis. Chromosomes from 40 /Urn early <b>diplotene</b> oocytes were found to possess a normal lampbrush chromosome morphology. The contour length of the loops found on these chromosomes was measured, the mean value determined and compared with that for lampbrush chromosomes found on 300 /xm mid-diplotene (Dumont stage II) oocytes. The mean contour length of the loops from 40 fim oocytes (12 - 33 ± 6 - 5 jim) was longer than that for the 300 ^m oocytes (7 - 897 ± 5 - 22 /im). Analysis of variance showed these two values to be significantly different (P< 0 - 01). The mean loop density (number of loops per 25 /im chromosome axis) was also determined for the two size classes of oocytes, being 9 - 33 ± 2 - 05 per 25 fjm of chromosome axis for the 40 /im size class and 11 - 2 ± 2 - 435 per 25 ̂ m of chromosome axis for the 300 /im size class. Analysis of variance showed these values to be significantly different (P< 0 - 01). The {{results of the present study}} demonstrate that the lampbrush chromosomes found in 40 fim early <b>diplotene</b> oocytes possess a greater loop contour length and a lower density of loops than those found in 300 fim, mid-diplotene oocytes. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed...|$|E
