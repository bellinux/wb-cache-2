40|$|The {{enhancement}} of thermoelectric {{figure of merit}} ZT requires to either increase the power factor or reduce the phonon conductance, or even both. In graphene, the high phonon thermal conductivity is the main factor limiting the thermoelectric conversion. The common strategy to enhance ZT is therefore to introduce phonon scatterers to suppress the phonon conductance while retaining high electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient. Although thermoelectric performance is eventually enhanced, all studies based on this strategy show a significant reduction of the electrical conductance, most often leading to a lower electronic performance. In this study we show that appropriate sources of disorder, including isotopes and vacancies at lowest electron density positions, {{can be used as}} phonon scatterers to reduce the phonon conductance in graphene ribbons without degrading the electrical conductance, particularly in the low-energy region which is the most important range for device operation. By means of atomistic calculations using semi-empirical Tight-Binding and Force Constant models in combination with Non-Equilibrium Green function formalism, we show that the natural electronic properties of graphene ribbons can be fully preserved while their thermoelectric efficiency is strongly enhanced. For ribbons of width M = 5 dimer lines, room-temperature ZT is enhanced from less than 0. 26 for defect-free ribbons to more than 2. 5.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{alternatives}} {{were considered to}} keep pecan processing economically competitive and sustainable. The industry needed a low risk evaluation technique for testing new high capital plant configurations. A simulation model was developed using the AweSimTM simulation system to form the model structure and framework. The Visual SLAMTM and Visual BASIC programming languages were used to build a network model that provided a mathematical-logical representation of the system. The model mathematically expresses all sub-processes including moisture conditioning, pasteurizing, cracking, shelling, sizing, manual and electronic sorting, resizing, resorting, and packaging. The pecan process simulation model consists of 24 RESOURCES, 353 ACTIVITIES, 48 AWAIT/QUEUE and FREE nodes, 83 BATCH and UNBATCH nodes, 79 ASSIGN nodes, 20 COLCT nodes, 39 GOON nodes, 10 other miscellaneous nodes and a graphic user interface (GUI). The model provides information on equipment utilization, delays, queues and bottlenecks for each process in the system. It also predicts total pecan cracked and total pecan packed, including details of production for each size class i. e. halves; large; medium; small; midget; fine; granule; and oil stock. The model was validated quantitatively by comparing output with actual production figures and qualitatively by plant management. Five options of process alternatives were simulated using the pecan simulation model.

In the inner valence shell, the attachment of methyl to glycine causes a splitting of its orbital 10 a? into orbitals lia and 12 a of L-alanine, whereas in the outer valence shell the methyl group results in an insertion of an additional orbital pair of 19 a and 20 a.

[...] University of Washington, 1989 A small n (n = 10) within subject {{design study}} was {{conducted}} to concurrently describe patterns of social interaction and maternal stress response during active labor. Multiple methods and repeated measures were utilized to capture the complex nature of this person-environment transaction. Physiologic measures, observational methods and a qualitative interview were used. Participants were married, Caucasian, English-speaking, middle class, healthy, low risk, functional primigravidae between the ages of 22 and 33 years, who labored and gave birth in a large, urban, Level III obstetrical unit. Maternal stress parameters measured at time 1 (T 1) defined as 5 - 6 centimeters of cervical dilation and time 2 (T 2), 90 minutes later or complete dilation included: state anxiety (Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory), plasma cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, report of pain (10 centimeter visual analogue pain scale). In addition, maternal heart rate (MHR) and fetal heart rate (FHR) were measured every minute for approximately 90 minutes from T 1 to T 2 via a Hewlett Packard 8040 A <b>Dual</b> Capacity <b>electronic</b> fetal monitor and a computerized data acquisition system. Social interactions were assessed simultaneously with the Labor Social Environment Observational Code (LSEOC), which assessed who interacted with the laboring woman, what type of interaction occurred and maternal affect and contraction status associated with the interaction. Labor progress, procedures, use of medication and length of labor were also assessed using Friedman Graphic Analysis of Labor. A semi-structured qualitative interview was conducted within 24 hours after delivery to obtain the women's perceptions of the physical and psychosocial childbirth environment during labor. Analysis of data focused on within subject variance with attention to patterns within and across subjects. Data was presented descriptively and graphically. Time series analytic techniques were planned but not feasible due to low time zero correlations of pertinent variables. Social interaction data exhibited three childbirth environmental patterns; (1) the sustaining; (2) the protecting: engaged; and (3) the protecting: disengaged environments. Maternal stress parameters covaried with environmental type. Labor outcome was related to environmental type. The study is an initial examination of the labor social environment and its relationship with measures of maternal stress response. Studies in the past have focused on individual responses and have rarely, if ever, described them in an environmental content. Data from the study will be useful to perinatal nurses, childbirth educators and parents to help further understanding of the person/environment relationship during childbirth. Future nursing intervention and nursing research should focus on the manipulation of the social environment rather than the physical appointments in labor and delivery to improve childbirth outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Integrins {{constitute}} {{a large family}} of heterodimeric cell-surface, transmembrane receptors, which {{play a major role}} in cell/cell and cell/matrix adhesive interactions. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is known to be the integrin recognition site of many extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, osteopontin, collagen, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, laminin, etc. On the other hand, it is well known that low doses of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) decrease platelet aggregation by causing an inhibitory effect on thromboxane A 2 production by platelets. Several antiplatelet strategies have already been developed and are under preclinical or clinical investigation. In the present thesis, the synthesis of linear and cyclic RGD analogs incorporating salicylic acid derivatives is reported. The syntheses of the new analogs were carried out by using classic methods of peptide synthesis in liquid or solid phase. The synthesized compounds were purified by RP-HPLC and lyophilised to give fluffy solid, identified by ESI-MS spectra. These compounds were tested for inhibitory activity on human platelet aggregation in vitro, by adding common aggregation reagents to citrated platelet rich plasma (PRP). The aggregation was determined using a <b>dual</b> channel <b>electronic</b> aggregometer by recording the increase of light transmission. Their specificity for the Gp receptors was checked by using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against Gp Ib, Gp IIb/IIIa, Gp IIIa and GMP 140 receptors. Based on the results of the biological studies we could report the next inferences: 1. From the studied synthetic RGD analogs only peptides – amides are active against human platelet aggregation in vitro. 2. The coupling of salicylic acid with the RGD peptides enforces the antiplatelet activity in vitro of the single tripeptide. From the above peptides, the analog 26 (tripeptide incorporating salicylic acid) shows strong antiplatelet activity (IC 50 = 50 ##), whereas the analog 23 (only tripeptide) has IC 50 = 540 ##. 3. The protection of the #-carboxy group of Asp as benzylester increases the activity of the peptides in comparison with those having the #-carboxy group unprotected. Thus, our results ensure the theory of necessity of the existence a lipophile center on the C-terminal side of the peptide. 4. The incorporation of salicylic acid derivatives in the RGD peptide does not increase further the antiplatelet activity than the incorporation of salicylic acid does. 5. Among the cyclic RGD peptides only the analog 61, having the disulfide bridge between the cysteine and the thiosalicylic acid, shows strong antiplatelet activity in vitro (IC 50 = 8 ##). 6. Most of the analogs show high binding affinity for the Gp Ib receptor. The cyclic analog 61 shows special selectivity for this receptor at concetrations of 110 ##. 7. The analog 39, although it shows low antiplatelet activity, has high binding affinity for the Gp Ib receptor. Probably, this activity is due to the atom of Cl at the 5 position of aromatic ring of salicylic acid. 8. According to the literature data, it is the first time that synthetic RGD peptides show strong binding affinity for the Gp Ib receptor, which is responsible for the platelet adhesion to the subenthothelium. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work investigates, whether openEHR {{with its}} {{reference}} model, archetypes and templates {{is suitable for}} the digital representation of demographic as well as clinical data. Moreover, it elaborates openEHR {{as a tool for}} modelling Hospital Information Systems on a regional level based on a national logical infrastructure. OpenEHR is a dual model approach developed for the modelling of Hospital Information Systems enabling semantic interoperability. A holistic solution to this represents the use of <b>dual</b> model based <b>Electronic</b> Healthcare Record systems. Modelling data in the field of obstetrics is a challenge, since different regions demand locally specific information for the process of treatment. Smaller health units in developing countries like Brazil or Malaysia, which until recently handled automatable processes like the storage of sensitive patient data in paper form, start organizational reconstruction processes. This archetype proof-of-concept investigation has tried out some elements of the openEHR methodology in cooperation with a health unit in Colombo, Brazil. Two legal forms provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health have been analyzed and classified into demographic and clinical data. LinkEHR-Ed editor was used to read, edit and create archetypes. Results show that 33 clinical and demographic concepts, which are necessary to cover data demanded by the Unified National Health System, were identified. Out of the concepts 61 % were reused and 39 % modified to cover domain requirements. The detailed process of reuse, modification and creation of archetypes is shown. We conclude that, although a major part of demographic and clinical patient data were already represented by existing archetypes, a significant part required major modifications. In this study openEHR proved to be a highly suitable tool in the modelling of complex health data. In combination with LinkEHR-Ed software it offers user-friendly and highly applicable tools, although the complexity built by the vast specifications requires expert networks to define generally excepted clinical models. Finally, this project has pointed out main benefits enclosing high coverage of obstetrics data on the Clinical Knowledge Manager, simple modelling, and wide network and support using openEHR. Moreover, barriers described are enclosing the allocation of clinical content to respective archetypes, as well as stagnant adaption of changes on the Clinical Knowledge Manager leading to redundant efforts in data contribution {{that need to be addressed}} in future works...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} {{issues related to}} the {{formation}} and validity of electronic contracts on a comparative basis between the English, American and UNCITRAL approaches.   When examining the English approach, reference will be made to relevant EC Directives in relation to the subject matter. This thesis has four main objectives.   First, {{to assess the impact of}} using electronic communication tools to reach agreement.   Second, to identify some key points that should be considered when examining the formal validity of electronic contracts. Third, to establish a foundation for having a valid contract in which rights and obligations could arise accordingly.   Finally, this thesis aims to identify whether the traditional contract law rules are able to meet the challenges that are brought by the use of electronic communication tools, or whether they require reform. It will be noticed throughout that electronic contracts come in different types.   This leads to difficulty with introducing one rule to cover all types of electronic contracts. Furthermore, some concerns arise when electronic communication tools are used to form contracts as to the exact time of contracting. Other concerns arise when trying to fulfil some legal formalities such as writing and signature.   This is because of the special and <b>dual</b> nature of <b>electronic</b> data and the possibility of using different types of signature methods in cyberspace. Finally, it is important to consider taking steps to update some of the current contract law rules to work alongside the electronic technology revolution.   Some aspects of the traditional contract law rules become challenging when applied to electronic contracts.   For example, the issues of contract formation and the use of electronic and intelligent software require direct attention when considering the issue of e-contracts.   The reference to such challenging well-established contract law rules is necessary throughout this thesis, however, since the current rules which deal with electronic commerce in general and electronic contracts in particular do not cover all the issues that are related to electronic contracts.   Lastly, this thesis will sound the alarm on the need to raise the legal awareness of both online users and website developers when contracting online. Chapter Two will assess the use of electronic communication tools to form such contracts, and the sorts of problems that could arise as a consequence. Chapter Three will highlight whether or not electronic contracts can be considered written and signed when the law imposes such requirement.   This chapter will also seek to determine whether there is a need for such formalities in cyberspace. Chapter Four is designed to deal with selected issues of material validity of electronic contracts.   This chapter is essential when considering all types of electronic contracts, including formal ones.   It will consider issues that are related to mutual assent in cyberspace, and the problems that could arise with web-based contracts in relation to these.
