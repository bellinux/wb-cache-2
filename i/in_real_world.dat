25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Pentium 4 and Pentium D design, the Core 2 technology sees a greater benefit from memory running synchronously with the Front Side Bus (FSB). This means {{that for the}} Conroe CPUs with FSB of 1066MT/s, the ideal memory performance for DDR2 is PC2-8500. In a few configurations, using PC2-5300 instead of PC2-4200 can actually decrease performance. Only when going to PC2-6400 is there a significant performance increase. While DDR2 memory models with tighter timing specifications do improve performance, the difference <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> games and applications is often negligible.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E

His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} geneticist Sewall Wright {{focused on}} combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, {{and the effects}} of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations, which could exhibit genetic drift. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming {{aware of the importance of}} geographical isolation <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> populations. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.|$|E
25|$|On high-traction {{surfaces}} such as bitumen, or concrete, many (though not all) ABS-equipped {{cars are}} able to attain braking distances better (i.e. shorter) than those that would be possible {{without the benefit of}} ABS. <b>In</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> conditions, even an alert and experienced driver without ABS would find it difficult to match or improve on the performance of a typical driver with a modern Anti-lock Braking System-equipped vehicle. ABS reduces chances of crashing, and/or the severity of impact. The recommended technique for non-expert drivers in an ABS-equipped car, in a typical full-braking emergency, is to press the brake pedal as firmly as possible and, where appropriate, to steer around obstructions. In such situations, ABS will significantly reduce the chances of a skid and subsequent loss of control.|$|E

25|$|Manex also handled {{creature}} effects, such as Sentinels {{and machines}} <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent {{at the end}} of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.|$|E
25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, another thing that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E

Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E
