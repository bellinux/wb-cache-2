40|$|The {{behavior}} of Rossby waves on a shear {{flow in the}} presence of a nonlinear critical layer is studied, with particular emphasis on the role played by the critical layer in a Rossby wave resonance mechanism. Previous steady analyses are extended to the resonant case and it is found that the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> dominates the solution, provided the flow configuration is not resonant for the higher harmonics induced by the critical layer. Numerical simulations for the forced initial value problem show that the solution evolves towards the analysed steady state when conditions are resonant for the <b>forced</b> <b>wave,</b> and demonstrate some of the complications that arise when they are resonant for higher harmonics...|$|E
40|$|Flume {{measurements}} of a one-dimensional sliding hump starting from rest in quiescence fresh water indicate {{that when the}} hump travels at speed less than the shallow-water wave celerity, three waves emerge, travelling in two directions. One wave travels {{in the opposite direction}} to the sliding hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (backward free wave). Another wave travels approximately in step with the hump (<b>forced</b> <b>wave),</b> and the remaining wave travels {{in the direction of the}} hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (forward free wave). These experiments were completed for a range of sliding hump speed relative to the shallow-water wave celerity, up to unity of this ratio, to investigate possible derivation from solutions of the Euler equation with non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms being included or excluded. For the experimental arrangements tested, the forced waves were negative (depression or reduced water surface elevation) waves while the free waves were positive (bulges or increased water surface elevation). For experiments where the sliding hump travelled at less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity did not include transient behaviour measurements (i. e. when the three waves still overlapped). The three wave framework was partially supported by these measurements in that the separated forward and forced waves were compared to measurements. For the laboratory scale experiments, the forward free wave height was predicted reasonably by the long-wave equation (ignoring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms) when the sliding hump speed was less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity. The <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> depression magnitude required the Euler equations for all hump speed tested. The long-wave solution, while being valid in a limited parameter range, does predict the existence of the three waves as found in these experiments (forward travelling waves measured quantitatively while the backward travelling waves visually by video). Nevertheless, the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> transient development required non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms for higher sliding hump speeds. The forward free wave, controversially, does not need non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms until much higher hump speeds, suggesting that the forward free wave falls in the parameter space where long-wave equations apply whereas the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> more often falls into the parameter space requiring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms. It does raise the question of why the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> transient dynamics does not impact on the initial transient dynamics where the forward free wave is in the long-wave theory, escaping the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> (at least for speeds less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity) ...|$|E

Time-dependent simulations are made including damping mechanisms, wave-mean flow interactions, a zonal wind driving force and wave-wave interactions. The initial mean zonal wind permits the resonance of the barotropic mode, rather than the first internal mode as in a previous study. It is found that even when damping and nonlinear interactions are included, the growth rate and the amplitude achieved by the resonant barotropic wave {{are similar to those}} occurring in observed planetary wave amplification episodes, such as those seen in some developing blocking conditions.

40|$|Baroclinic Rossby wave motions in the off-equatorial oceans are {{investigated}} {{with emphasis}} on how eddy dissipation can influence the propagation of the height anomalies when both the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> response to wind in the interior ocean and the free wave response originating along the ocean’s coastal and topographic boundaries are present. By explicitly estimating the decay scale for the long baroclinic Rossby wave, the authors show that the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> patterns at all off-equatorial regions appear to propagate westward at 2 cr, where cr is the phase speed of the long baroclinic wave. The presence of the boundary-generated, free Rossby waves in the low latitudes, however, reinforces the 1 cr phase propagation in the combined height anomaly fields. Toward higher latitudes, this reinforcement weakens as the boundary-generated, free waves become highly dissipative; as a result, the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> motion becomes more dominant, which works to increase the apparent phase speed up to 2 cr. In the subpolar regions where the annual baroclinic Rossby waves become evanescent, an apparent phase speed higher than 2 cr is observed when an annual, standing wave response and a propagating wave response with an interannual frequency coexist. Stronger annual and interannual wind fluctuations over the Southern Hemisphere subpolar regions than over the Northern Hemisphere subpolar regions suggest that this coupling, and the phase speed higher than 2 cr, {{are more likely to}} be detected in the Southern Hemisphere subpolar oceans. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{helicity}} in the dynamics of energy transfer in {{a modified version of}} the Navier-Stokes equations with explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry. We select different set of triads participating in the dynamics on the basis of their helicity content. In particular, we remove the negative helically polarized Fourier modes at all wave numbers except for those falling on a localized shell of wave number, |k| ~ k(m). Changing k(m) to be above or below the forcing scale, k(f), we are able to assess the energy transfer of triads belonging to different interaction classes. We observe that when the negative helical modes are present only at a wave number smaller than the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> numbers, an inverse energy cascade develops with an accumulation of energy on a stationary helical condensate. Vice versa, when negative helical modes are present only at a wave number larger than the <b>forced</b> <b>wave</b> numbers, a transition from backward to forward energy transfer is observed in the regime when the minority modes become energetic enough...|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to develop a}} method for the rapid {{electromechanical}} sound power calculation of electrical machines to be used in industry. The core idea is that the numerical simulation of sound radiation is carried out only once. Then, a number of characterizing curves, known as unit-wave responses, are extracted from the results and stored. Finally, the unit-wave responses, together with the magnetic excitation <b>force</b> <b>waves,</b> are used for fast sound power estimation. An experimental method for the determination of unit-wave responses is also developed, which serves especially the process of model verification. The secondary aim is to study the items crucial for the modeling of the sound radiation of electrical machines, such as the effect of tangential <b>force</b> <b>waves</b> on the vibration response, the correlation of <b>force</b> <b>waves</b> {{in the case of a}} DTC converter supply, the effect of impregnation on the material properties of the stator core, and the feasibility of the approximate methods for sound power calculation. The most important results of the work done in the thesis include the following: 1) the unit-wave-based sound power calculation performs well, provided that <b>force</b> <b>waves</b> with different wave numbers are weakly correlated, which was verified for the case of a machine supplied by a DTC converter; 2) tangential <b>force</b> <b>waves</b> may have a remarkable effect on the response, which is observed as either an increased or decreased response level, depending on the phase difference of the radial and tangential force waves; 3) the VPI impregnation affects the structural material properties of the stator core considerably, which manifests itself as increased stiffness and decreased damping of the stator core, and 4) the high-frequency boundary element method seems appropriate for the fast and approximate sound power calculation of electrical machinery...|$|R
40|$|A finite size plate {{excited by}} {{airborne}} sound has both forced and freely propagating bending <b>waves.</b> The <b>forced</b> <b>waves</b> are {{generated by the}} airborne sound excitation and the freely propagating waves are generated when the <b>forced</b> <b>waves</b> are reflected at a discontinuity such as {{the edges of the}} plate, studs or stringers. Unless the plate is very heavily damped, the transverse vibration of the plate is dominated by the freely propagating waves. However below the critical frequency of the plate, the direct airborne sound transmission of the plate is dominated by the <b>forced</b> <b>waves</b> because their radiation efficiency is very much greater than that of the freely propagating waves. The prediction of airborne flanking sound transmission requires the prediction of the transmission of the bending waves at the junction of plates.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{laboratory}} data sets on surf beat is presented, {{with a focus}} on the dissipation of long wave energy in the surf zone. It is frequently assumed that incident <b>forced</b> long <b>waves,</b> or "bound" long waves, are released from short wave groups when the short waves break, subsequently propagating to the shore as a free wave. Free long waves may additionally be generated by the moving short wave breakpoint Convincing evidence of the release of <b>forced</b> long <b>waves</b> as a result of short wave breaking is lacking, while there appears to be strong evidence to the contrary from a range of recent laboratory experiments. The data from the laboratory experiments are also consistent with field observations of strong nearshore dissipation of long waves. These data are also consistent with Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962), who suggest that the <b>forced</b> long <b>wave</b> may reduce in amplitude following short wave breaking, not that it might be released as a free <b>wave.</b> In contrast, <b>forced</b> long <b>waves</b> can be progressively "released" from the groups when the short waves are in shallow water, since these conditions correspond to those where the <b>forced</b> long <b>wave</b> satisfies the free wave dispersion relationship. This frequently occurs prior to short wave breaking for mild wave conditions, but here it is shown that these conditions are not usually satisfied at the short wave breakpoint for storm conditions. Energy transfers between free and <b>forced</b> <b>waves</b> are also discussed with regard the data. A surf beat similarity parameter that incorporates both relative beach slope and short wave steepness is suggested, which distinguishes between different long <b>wave</b> <b>forcing</b> regimes inside the surf zone.
