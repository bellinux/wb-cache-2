40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve knowledge of the deglaciation stages in Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) by applying 36 Cl cosmogenic exposure dating to 28 samples from moraine and <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> glacier boulders and glacial polished surfaces, in 5 glaciated valleys around Veleta Peak (3396 m asl; 37 0300200 N 3 2005400 W). The results show that shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during the LGM, the heads of the glacial valleys were occupied by ice tongues, with possible glacial transfluence between the valleys. After 19 ka, a major glacial regression started, but glaciers during the Oldest Dryas (OD) expanded again and refilled the valley bottoms. The glacial advances of the pre-LGM, LGM and OD formed polygenic moraine systems. During the Bølling-Allerød the glaciers receded and probably disappeared. Thereafter, the valley bottoms remained ice-free. During the Younger Dryas (YD) small glaciers developed again, but only in cirques shaped on east-facing slopes. Subsequently, these glaciers started retreating towards their valley heads and finally disappeared completely. With the onset of the Holocene, rock glaciers developed inside the deglaciated cirques on the eastern slopes of some valleys, but only under the most active and protected headwalls did large complex rock glaciers develop and remained active until the mid-Holocene. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|High-diversity marine biotic {{communities}} {{characterize the}} lower Kasimovian (Upper Pennsylvanian) carbonates of the Las Llacerias Formation in the Ándara Massif (Picos de Europa Province, Cantabrian Mountains, Spain). The carbonates accumulated {{on a small}} thrust-top ramp system. Within the shallow, low-energy and euphotic realms, biotic communities were characterized by abundant photozoans (calcareous algae and cyanobacteria) and heterozoans including filter and suspension feeders (calcareous and siliceous sponges, bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids), diverse other metazoans (rugose solitary and colonial corals, tabulate corals, bivalves, gastropods and echinoids), benthic foraminifers including very abundant small incrusting "tubiforms" and conspicuous swarms of cement-filled spheres (calcispheres or Penella). Small-sized buildups of chaetetid sponges, syringoporids, branching rugose corals, Anthracoporella and phylloid algae commonly developed in these shallow-water environments. Meanwhile, mud mounds formed at greater water depths, mostly below the lower limit of the phothic zone. The occurrence of such diverse biotic communities and the grain composition of the shallow-water deposits, not recorded in the platform-top successions of the antecedent Bashkirian-Moscovian carbonate shelf (Valdeteja and Picos de Europa formations) are interpreted as linked to increased nutrient levels (mesotrophic to mildly eutrophic conditions) in the actual sea-surface water. The nutrients are inferred to have resulted from land-derived fluxes from the rivers draining the adjacent growing Variscan Orogenic chain. Nutrients were subsequently transported into the narrowed marine shallowing foreland basin located in {{the eastern side of}} Pangea, within the palaeoequatorial humid belt. Comparison to the Pennsylvanian Auernig Group in the Carnic Alps allows the discrimination between the influence of land-derived versus upwelling-derived nutrients, providing a useful tool in the interpretation of biotic assemblages in the <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> record. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Shale {{water as}} a {{by-product}} obtained by Petrobras, Brazil, {{during the process of}} extraction of petroleum from <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> may act as an inducer of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) to some plant pathogens. The objective of the present investigation was to verify the effect of seed treatment and foliar application with shale water in inducing SAR of soybean to soybean rust under greenhouse and field conditions. In greenhouse experiments, seed treatment alone with shale water significantly reduced the severity of soybean rust and the control efficiency after 11 and 14 days after inoculation was between 54. 1 % and 57. 8 %. Whereas seed treatment and only one foliar application with shale water the control efficiency due to SAR 14 and 11 days after inoculation was between 99. 7 % and 100 %, respectively. Such treatments gave similar results under field experiments where the control efficiency of soybean rust was between 79. 0 % and 99. 35 % in shale water treated plots as compared to the untreated plots, in 2015. onsequently, this resulted in yield increase between 14. 8 % and 28. 8 % depending upon the seed treatment and foliar applications with shale water alone or in mixture with a fungicide. Seed health testing revealed lower number of seeds infected with some pathogens in treatments where either shale water or fungicide was used. Seed treatment and one foliar application were sufficient to induce SAR against soybean rust. This is the first report to demonstrate SAR of soybean to soybean rust induced by shale water.

40|$|Return flow {{in a deep}} {{subduction}} channel (DSC) {{has been}} proposed to explain rapid exhumation of high pressure–low temperature metamorphic rocks, entirely based on the <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> record. Supported by thermo-mechanical models, the DSC is envisioned as a thin layer {{on top of the}} subducted plate reaching down to minimum depths of about 150 km. We perform numerical simulations of high-frequency seismic wave propagation (1 – 5 Hz) to explore potential seismological evidence for the in situ existence of a DSC. Motivated by field observations, for modeling purposes we assume a simple block-in-matrix (BIM) structure with eclogitic blocks floating in a serpentinite matrix. Homogenization calculations for BIM structures demonstrate that effective seismic velocities in such composites are lower than in the surrounding oceanic crust and mantle, with nearly constant values along {{the entire length of the}} DSC. Synthetic seismograms for receivers at the surface computed for intermediate depth earthquakes in the subducted oceanic crust for models with and without DSC turn out to be markedly influenced by its presence or absence. While for both models P and S waveforms are dominated by delayed high-amplitude guided waves, models with DSC exhibit a very different pattern of seismic arrivals compared to models without DSC. The main reason for the difference is the greater length and width of the low-velocity channel when a DSC is present. Seismic velocity heterogeneity within the DSC or oceanic crust is of minor importance. The characteristic patterns allow for definition of typical signatures by which models with and without DSC may be discriminated. The signatures stably recur in slightly modified form for earthquakes at different depths inside subducted oceanic crust. Available seismological data from intermediate depth earthquakes recorded in the forearc of the Hellenic subduction zone exhibit similar multi-arrival waveforms as observed in the synthetic seismograms for models with DSC. According to our results, observation of intermediate depth earthquakes along a profile across the forearc may allow to test the hypothesis of a DSC and to identify situations where such processes could be active today...|$|E
40|$|Geodiversity - {{the natural}} range of geological, geomorphological and soil {{features}} - is {{the topic of}} this book. More precisely, geomorphological mapping techniques, which {{have been developed for}} capturing the geodiversity of mountainous areas, and a related method for assessing the value - the geoconservation potential - of the mapped landforms of these landscapes. The case studies presented cover the variety of mountain landscapes of Vorarlberg and Liechtenstein. The first part of the book deals with methods of geomorphological mapping of high-relief areas. The classical, field-based, detailed, area-covering mapping method which was developed over the years by researchers at the University of Amsterdam, is nowadays combined with the analysis and interpretation of digital terrain models derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data in a geographical information system (GIS). Geomorphological derivatives - land surface parameters - are calculated from the LiDAR data and are applied in digital geomorphological mapping in GIS. The geomorphological map, thus, has become a digital geodatabase, in which information acquired in the field is linked with data from many other sources. Data is stored in ‘layers’, which can be visualized individually and in a variety of combinations, in GIS. Essential is that the mapping does not focus on unique or spectacular geomorphological features or groups of these only, but covers the total landscape, i. e. also the ‘common’ sites in which people, animals and plants live. The assessment of the geoconservation potential is done for all landforms, i. e. inventories are made for entire selected areas. In GIS, the sites are assessed individually using a set of quantitative and qualitative weighting and ranking criteria, the most important of which are scientific relevance and frequency of occurrence. The resulting scores may be adjusted - downgraded or upgraded - by applying expert knowledge. Case studies are presented {{in the second part of}} the book. Clusters of landforms highly valuable in terms of geoconservation potential have been selected and are discussed in detail in explanatory notes. The clusters cover a wide range of landscapes which are all typical for mountainous areas. The Gamperdonatal near Nenzinger Himmel, the tributary valleys of the Gamperdonatal, the Malbun region of Liechtenstein and the mountains around Lech show a high-alpine morphology, in which, among other features, moraines, meltwater deposits, <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> glaciers, sulphate (gypsum) karst landforms and deep-seated mass movements are classified as highly valuable landscape elements. Ice-marginal landforms and deposits created during the final stages of deglaciation at the end of last ice age abound in the lower topographic settings of the southern Walgau region between Nenzing and Gurtis and on the eastern flank of the Rhine Valley in the municipalities of Götzis, Klaus, Fraxern and Weiler. All these landforms hold highly valuable information on the origin of the landscapes and the role of climate and climate change in landscape development...|$|E

40|$|The 14 km wide Valdorria outcrop (Pennsylvanian, Northern Spain) {{is one of}} the few {{examples}} of entirely exposed flat-topped and high relief carbonate platforms reported in the <b>fossil</b> <b>rock</b> record. Laterally and vertically traceable stratal patterns expose three phases of growth. Phase I is a 430 m thick platform to slope succession that prograded over 6 km, and is dated as Early Bashkirian (Akavasian–Askynbashian). Phase II aggraded and prograded, exhibiting 180 m thickness of cyclical platform top deposits, dated as Late Bashkirian (Asatauian). Phase III is a mound-shape structure that developed over the platform top of Phase II as a new phase of platform nucleation. It is 535 m thick and 2 km wide, and dated as Late Bashkirian (Asatauian–Transition interval). The observed changes of growth styles during platform evolution, from a prograding to an aggrading–prograding system, and a rapid aggradational phase, are inferred to be controlled by flexural subsidence in the active Cantabrian foreland basin, at the Variscan orogenic front. The metre-scale shallowing-upward cycles of the platform top are most probably due to glacioeustasy, as evidenced by well-recorded subaerial exposure surfaces superimposed on subtidal deposits, and by a stratal pattern recurrent in a short interval of about 160 Kyr. Observations of outcropping Bashkirian cyclothems in an isolated carbonate system, devoid of siliciclastic input, are relevant for a better understanding of the impact of high-frequency sea-level fluctuations on the carbonate factory. Moreover, progradation of the platform margin during Phase I reaches a rate of 2500 m/Myr, and 1810 m/Myr during Phase II; rates that are high when compared to other Pennsylvanian examples. The aggradation rate of 447 m/Myr calculated for Late Bashkirian–Transition interval (Phases I and II; uncorrected for compaction, missing beats and erosion) is uncommonly high in comparison to coeval Pennsylvanian examples. The platform exhibits a self-nourishing prograding microbial boundstone-dominated slope. Thus, the slope shedding model applies well to Valdorria. However, Phase II recorded eustatic variations able to inhibit the slope microbial boundstone factory during low sea-level stands; this is marked by common slope red-stained breccias synchronous to platform top subaerial exposure phases. Contrarily, periods of relative high sea-level and rapid subsidence in Phase III registered a greater development of cemented microbial boundstone. These observed, partly opposing relationships of sea-level stands, shedding modes and slope architecture provide an improvement of the currently used slope shedding model. The overall architecture of the Valdorria outcrop compares well with that of other contemporaneous platforms, such as Sierra del Cuera and Bolshoi Karatau. Valdorria shares the high-relief and flat-topped, steep slopes, cyclothemic patterns and occurrence of karst features with the Pricaspian Basin platforms (Tengiz, Karachaganak and Kashagan), with minor variations in facies distribution of the internal platform. Furthermore, the continuous seismic-scale outcrop of Valdorria, together with its isolated setting and asymmetrical growth, makes it an additional good candidate for potential subsurface analogues of hydrocarbon-bearing systems...|$|E
