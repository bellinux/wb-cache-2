40|$|There is {{evidence}} that expected warming trends from increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing have been locally masked by <b>irrigation</b> induced <b>cooling,</b> and it is uncertain how {{the magnitude of this}} irrigation masking effect will change in the future. Using an irrigation dataset integrated into a global general circulation model, we investigate the equilibrium magnitude of <b>irrigation</b> induced <b>cooling</b> under modern (Year 2000) and increased (A 1 B Scenario, Year 2050) GHG forcing, using modern irrigation rates in both scenarios. For the modern scenario, the cooling is largest over North America, India, the Middle East, and East Asia. Under increased GHG forcing, this cooling effect largely disappears over North America, remains relatively unchanged over India, and intensifies over parts of China and the Middle East. For North America, irrigation significantly increases precipitation under modern GHG forcing; this precipitation enhancement largely disappears under A 1 B forcing, reducing total latent heat fluxes and the overall <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooling</b> effect. Over India, irrigation rates are high enough to keep pace with increased evaporative demand from the increased GHG forcing and the magnitude of the cooling is maintained. Over China, GHG forcing reduces precipitation and shifts the region to a drier evaporative regime, leading to a relatively increased impact of additional water from irrigation on the surface energy balance. Irrigation enhances precipitation in the Middle East under increased GHG forcing, increasing total latent heat fluxes and enhancing the <b>irrigation</b> <b>cooling</b> effect. Ultimately, the extent to which irrigation will continue to compensate for the warming from increased GHG forcing will primarily depend on changes in the background evaporative regime, secondary irrigation effects (e. g. clouds, precipitation), and the ability of societies to maintain (or increase) current irrigation rates...|$|R

We investigated how this redistribution of water affects the global climate, focusing on its effects on near-surface temperatures. Using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), we compared global simulations with and without irrigation. To approximate actual irrigation amounts and locations as closely as possible, we used national-level census data of agricultural water withdrawals, disaggregated with maps of croplands, areas equipped for irrigation, and climatic water deficits. We further investigated the sensitivity of our results to the timing and spatial extent of irrigation. We found that irrigation alters climate significantly in some regions, but has a negligible effect on global-average near-surface temperatures. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>cooled</b> the northern mid-latitudes; the central and southeast United States, portions of southeast China and portions of southern and southeast Asia cooled by ~ 0. 5 K averaged over the year.

In this paper, we balance water availability in the Black Sea catchment with requirements and consumptive use of key water users, i. e., municipalities, power plants, manufacturing, irrigation and livestock breeding, accounting for evaporation from major reservoirs as well as environmental flow requirements. We use graph theory to highlight interrelations between users and countries along the hydrological network.

A cryothermal cooling source may overcome this limitation to increase the lesion dimension and reduce the risk of thrombus formation. METHODS: We compared the lesion dimensions created by 1) RF and 2) salineirrigated RF (SI RF) using a 7 F, 4 mm tip electrode catheter, 3) cryoablation (Cryo) and 4) cryothermal cooled RF (Cryo+RF) using a 10 F, 6. 5 mm tip electrode catheter and Cryo system (CryoCor, CA) in vertical (V) or horizontal (H) orientiation to a thigh muscle preparation. All 3 modes of RF were delivered for 1 minute at 50 W & 60 Â°C, and Cryo was delivered with double- 5 minutes freeze-thaw cycles. RESULTS: Of 211 (V= 106, H= 105) created, SI RF and Cryo+RF created deeper lesion than RF or Cryo application alone (Fig, p< 0. 05). In all 4 modes of application, lesions diameter were greater with V than H orientation (Fig, p< 0. 05). Cryo and Cryo+RF were associated with a significant lower incidence of thrombus formation on the lesions compared with RF and SI RF (0 / 87 vs. 26 / 124, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Cryothermal cooling during RF application resulted in a similar lesion dimension as SI RF.

The effect of irrigation and urbanization on temperature is separately documented in several studies. However, {{there are few}} studies analysing the combined effects of irrigation and urbanization on temperature. In this study, changes in surface temperature were analysed in relation to irrigation and urbanization on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China from 1955 to 2007. To better characterize the combined effects of these two processes on temperatures, long-term weather observations are used along with irrigation and urbanization data sets. The results indicated that irrigation had a significant cooling effect of 0. 17 - 0. 20 degrees Cdecade(- 1) on average daily maximum temperature of the hottest 1, 5, and 30 d of each year on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Compared with the reference conditions, irrigation also indicated a cooling effect of 0. 12 degrees Cdecade(- 1) on summertime daily maximum temperature. In contrast to its effect on maximum temperature, irrigation appeared to induce a warming effect of 0. 43 degrees C/decade on average daily minimum temperature of the coldest 1 d of each year.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} cooling systems produce {{water as}} a byproduct, which can be recovered and put to good use. In order to product cool air from a compressed refrigerant, a set of coils allow a hot, high-pressured refrigerant to dissipate its heat and condense into a liquid. An expansion valve is then typically used to evaporate and cool the refrigerant. This cool gas then runs {{through a set of}} coils that allows it to absorb heat and cool the air, which is blown over the coils and into the inside of the building. This process cools the warm coils, so when the warm air blowing past the coils reaches its dew point the moisture in the air condenses onto the coils, producing what is essentially distilled water. This byproduct of air conditioning units is called as Condensate drain water. The quality of condensate created by Air Conditioners is typically very high, having low amounts of suspended solids, a neutral to slightly acidic pH, and low temperatures. These characteristics make the condensate adequate for several non-potable uses such as <b>irrigation,</b> <b>cooling</b> tower make-up or toilet flushing. In addition to quality water, high recovery capacity is a major benefit of these systems. Although the amount of condensate produced can vary greatly and depends on the size and operational load of the Air-conditioning system as well as the ambient temperature and humidity within a particular region. A rule of thumb created by Karen Guz (Director of the Conservation Department for the San Antonio Water System, USA) is that 0. 1 to 0. 3 gallons of condensate per ton of air being chilled is produced every hour that the system is operating. Seizing this opportunity by replacing or supplementing potable water with the recovered condensate can considerably reduce a buildingâs demand for potable water. By implementing a condensate recovery system free, clean and unused water will be replacing costly, treated, high demand potable water.

40|$|Irrigation in some {{countries}} is a horticultural practice mainly used only to supply water. At {{the same time the}} use of micro-sprinklers have a powerful influence on the changes of temperature in orchards. When the airâs temperature is high (about 20 Â°C or higher) the evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>irrigation</b> significantly decreases the plantsâ surface temperature and air temperature. The cooling effect is stronger when the air is dryer. By using <b>cooling</b> <b>irrigation</b> regularly, canopy temperature can be decreased so that the beginning of blooming can be delayed. Also if the blooming is early and frost probability is high, serious damages can happen in orchards. The beneficial effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>irrigation</b> is the temperature reduction and frost protection. In March 2010, one month earlier than the expected blooming an irrigation system was established to produce anti-frost treatment and regulate the micro-climate of a plum and pear orchard which belongs to the University of Debrecen (Hungary). The objective of sprinklers was to cool the air by increasing water evaporation and relative humidity. The position of the micro-sprinklers was planned in three levels (around the tree trunks, a few cm near to the soil surface, in the crown region and above the crown, a half meter higher). The results showed that the water sprayed in the orchard by micro-jets influenced decisively the temperature of the plantation. At higher temperatures (around 20 Â°C), the drop of temperature may attain 5 - 7 Â°C. A low relative humidity of the air may increase the relative effect. When water was applied at intervals of 15 minutes for ten times a day from 8 am to 18 pm, the air, flowers and budâs surface temperature could be kept low. At certain days when the temperature was higher than 10 Â°C, irrigation was used at night time in similar 15 minutes intervals, from 18 pm and 6 am.

Irrigation impacts soil moisture and can ultimately influence clouds and precipitation through landâplanetary boundary layer (PBL) coupling processes. This dissertation {{is a collection}} of three studies that analyze the impact of irrigation on the atmosphere using NASA modeling tools the Land Information System (LIS) and the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting Model (NU-WRF) framework. â The first study investigates the effects of drip, flood, and sprinkler irrigation methods on landâatmosphere interactions, including landâPBL coupling and feedbacks at the local scale. The offline and coupled simulation results show that regional irrigation impacts are sensitive to time, space, and method and that <b>irrigation</b> <b>cools</b> and moistens the surface over and downwind of irrigated areas, ultimately resulting in both positive and negative feedbacks on the PBL depending on the time of day and background climate conditions. â The second study assesses the sprinkler irrigation scheme physics and model sensitivity to choice of irrigation intensity and greenness fraction over a small, high resolution domain in Nebraska and evaluates the model performance with Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) observations. Results show that differences between experiments are small at the interannual scale, but become more apparent at seasonal and daily time scales. In addition, field-scale heterogeneity resulting from the individual actions of farmers is not captured by the model and the amount of irrigation applied by the model exceeds that applied at the two irrigated fields. However, the seasonal timing of irrigation and soil moisture contrasts between irrigated and nonirrigated areas are simulated well by the model. â The third study assesses the individual and combined impacts of irrigation and wind turbines on surface fluxes, near surface temperature, and humidity. Results show that irrigation repartitions surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, reduces daytime temperatures and increases temperatures at night. Turbines weaken surface sensible heat fluxes minimally during the day but enough at nighttime to slightly reduce near surface temperature. The simulations that include both turbines and irrigation show that wind power production is slightly reduced when irrigation is included and irrigation contributes to a greater reduction in daytime surface sensible heat fluxes than would be realized with only turbines.

However, the suitability of irrigation water regarding salinity management should be assessed considering salt tolerance of the cultivated crops and soil characteristics. This means in areas with slightly high levels of salinity and sodium, groundwater can still be used for irrigating certain crops e.g. barley, sugar beet and wheat because different crops have different tolerance levels of salinity/sodium hazard (Bauder 2007).

Using a solar array simulator, we have verified that the RO can operate with varying power input and recovery rates to meet the water demands for <b>irrigation</b> and <b>cooling</b> of a greenhouse in north-west India. Cooling requires ventilation by a fan which has also been built, tested and optimised with a PV module outdoors. Results from the experiments with these two subsystems (RO and fan) are compared to theoretical predictions to reach conclusions about energy usage, sizing and cost. For example, the optimal sizing for the RO system is 0. 12 â 1. 3 m 2 of PV module per m 2 of membrane, depending on feed salinity. For the fan, the PV module area equals that of the fan aperture. The fan consumes < 30 J of electrical energy per m 3 of air moved which is 3 times less than that of standard fans. The specific energy consumption of the RO, at 1 â 2. 3 kWh ?m- 3, is comparable to that reported by others. Now that the subsystems have been verifi ed, the next step will be to integrate and test the whole system in the field...|$|R

Yet, these studies do not consider the fullhydrologic cycle from the bedrock to the atmosphere or apply simplified hydrologic models, neglecting theconnection of irrigation to water withdrawal and groundwater depletion. Thus, {{there is a need}} to incorporate waterresource management in 3 D hydrologic models coupled to earth system models. This study addresses the impact of water resource management, i. e. irrigation and groundwater abstraction, onland-atmosphere feedbacks through the terrestrial hydrologic cycle in a physics-based soil-vegetation-atmospheresystem simulating 3 D groundwater dynamics at the continental scale. The integrated Terrestrial Systems ModelingPlatform, TerrSysMP, consisting of the three-dimensional subsurface and overland flow model ParFlow, theCommunity Land Model CLM 3. 5 and the numerical weather prediction model COSMO of the German WeatherService, is set up over the European CORDEX domain in 0. 11 resolution. The model closes the terrestrial waterand energy cycles from aquifers into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic impacts are considered by applying actualdaily estimates of irrigation and groundwater abstraction from Wada et al. (2012, 2016), as a source at the landsurface and explicit removal of groundwater from aquifer storage, respectively. Simulations of the fully coupledsystem are performed over the 2003 European heat wave and compared to a reference simulation, which doesnot consider human interactions in the terrestrial water cycle. We study the space and time characteristics andevolution of temperature extremes, and soil moisture and precipitation anomalies influenced by human watermanagement during the heat wave. A first set of simulations utilizes the spectral nudging technique to keepthe large-scale circulation consistent to the driving ERA-Interim reanalysis and examines the direct and localfeedback pathway, along which <b>irrigation</b> <b>cools</b> the land surface, enhances evapotranspiration and increases thetotal atmospheric water vapor, which may induce local precipitation. A second set of simulations without spectralnudging addresses the indirect feedback, where the atmospheric circulation is modified indirectly by irrigation. Simulations are evaluated over a range of spatial and temporal scales, i. e. from daily to seasonal variations. Results indicate systematic responses at the land surface, but a strong non-linearity of the local feedback affectingtropospheric processes and the occurrence of precipitation, and hence emphasize the need to integrate humanwater management in regional climate simulations.

40|$|Detection {{of climate}} change in California and {{attribution}} of causes ABSTRACT: We use eight observational datasets to estimate Californiaaverage temperature trends over 19501999. Observed results are compared to trends from a suite of control simulations of natural internal climate variability. Observed increases in annualmean surface temperature are distinguishable from climate noise in some but not all observational datasets. The most robust results are large positive trends in mean and maximum daily temperatures in late winter/early spring, as well as increases in minimum daily temperatures from January to September. These trends are inconsistent with modelbased estimates of natural internal climate variability, and thus require one or more external forcing agents to be explained. Our {{results suggest that the}} warming of Californian winters over {{the second half of the}} twentieth century is associated with humaninduced changes in largescale atmospheric circulation. We also hypothesize that the lack of a detectable increase in summertime maximum temperature arises from a cooling associated with largescale <b>irrigation.</b> This <b>cooling</b> may have, until now, counteracted the warming induced by increasing greenhouse gases and urbanization effects. Humaninduced climate change is a reality. Anthropogenic climate change has been detected at global scale (e. g. 15) and also in large regions (69), including North America (10). In California, there is great political and scientific interest in the question of how humancaused climate change will manifest itself. Will nighttime temperatures increase more than daytime temperatures? Will there be more warming in winter than in summer? How will precipitation and snow be affected? Impacts on agriculture, water availability, human health depend on answers to these questions. Here, we investigate if a climate change "signal " is detectable in the state of California, and possibly attributable to human causes...|$|R
40|$|The {{excess heat}} that {{is stored in}} urban {{materials}} and created by human activities implies that people living in cities are particularly vulnerable to heat stress and heat related illness. In Australia, where extreme weather and prolonged drought are common, heat exposure in urban areas can be significantly exacerbated. The combination of increasing urban development, excessive urban heating, and lower water availability, alongside the impacts of future climate change could have damaging implications for the human {{health and well-being of}} urban dwellers. Water management in cities {{plays an important role in}} determining urban climates, but minimal work has been done that directly acknowledges these interconnected issues. Integrated water management approaches, such as water sensitive urban design (WSUD), provide a means for retaining water in the urban environment through stormwater harvesting and reuse. This study examines the potential for WSUD to provide cooling benefits and reduce human exposure to heat stress and thermal discomfort. A high resolution observational field campaign, measuring surface level microclimate variables and remotely sensed land surface characteristics, was conducted in a mixed residential suburb containing WSUD in Adelaide, South Australia. At Mawson Lakes microclimate variability was measured, including air temperature and thermal comfort, to investigate the microclimate effects of WSUD features, including man-made lakes, bio-filtration wetlands, and irrigated open space. Additionally, the SURFEX (SURFace EXternalisÃ©e in French) model was used to simulate the potential for irrigation to reduce exposure to heat stress and provide more thermally comfortable conditions during heatwaves. Clear evidence was found that WSUD approaches and <b>irrigation</b> can provide <b>cooler</b> air temperature and more comfortable thermal urban environments. It was found that the microclimate conditions that people experience in Mawson Lakes vary significantly over small spatial scales. The effects of WSUD features were seen to be highly localised, having little effect beyond 50 m from the source. Air temperature variability was influenced by land surface differences, such as proximity to water bodies. Sites that there were influenced by water bodies were up to 1. 8 Â°C cooler during the day. However, human thermal comfort (HTC) was less influenced by land surface characteristics, and was mostly determined by contrasts in shading and airflow in the environment. The modelling analysis showed that there is high potential for <b>irrigation</b> to <b>cool</b> air temperature during heatwave conditions; with irrigation a 2. 8 Â°C maximum reduction in daily average temperature was predicted. From this research some specific recommendations for the implementation of WSUD have been developed. These include consideration of the local wind regime when implementing WSUD; the use of smaller distributed features throughout the urban landscape at targeted locations; the use of irrigation during heatwaves to provide cooling; and the retention of trees in urban areas to provide shade, and augment the thermal comfort benefits provided by WSUD features. Overall, this research argues that distributed WSUD features can be used to capture, store, and treat stormwater, simultaneously providing ecological benefits and thermal benefits. Further, harvested stormwater can be re-integrated into the urban environment, thereby helping to maintain vegetation and providing distributed evaporative cooling benefits...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bone marrow {{stimulation}} {{is performed}} using several surgical techniques {{that have not been}} systematically compared or optimized for a desired cartilage repair outcome. In this study, we investigated acute osteochondral characteristics following microfracture and comparing to drilling in a mature rabbit model of cartilage repair. Microfracture holes were made to a depth of 2 mm and drill holes to either 2 mm or 6 mm under <b>cooled</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Animals were sacrificed 1 day postoperatively and subchondral bone assessed by histology and micro-CT. We confirmed one hypothesis that microfracture produces fractured and compacted bone around holes, essentially sealing them off from viable bone marrow and potentially impeding repair. In contrast, drilling cleanly removed bone from the holes to provide access channels to marrow stroma. Our second hypothesis that drilling would cause greater osteocyte death than microfracture due to heat necrosis was not substantiated, because more empty osteocyte lacunae were associated with microfracture than drilling, probably due to shearing and crushing of adjacent bone. Drilling deeper to 6 mm versus 2 mm penetrated the epiphyseal scar in this model and led to greater subchondral hematoma. Our study revealed distinct differences between microfracture and drilling for acute subchondral bone structure and osteocyt...|$|R
