25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D’Esposito later {{stated that}} Marvel was {{considering}} {{the idea of}} introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There’s always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can’t all be at the same level. So maybe {{there are some that}} are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off. I could see that happening." [...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that.

Castel, and others investigated the idea that age would alter an individual's belief in the fallacy. To test this idea researchers conducted a cross-sectional study where they sampled 455 participants {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 90 years old. These participants were given a questionnaire preceded by a prompt that said in college and professional basketball games no players make 100% of their attempted shots. Then the questionnaire asked two important questions: (1) Does a basketball player {{have a better chance of}} making a shot after having just made the last two or three shots than after having missed the last two or three shots?

[...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I hate being approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005.

60|$|The town of Tacames, in the {{republic}} of Ecuador, is not large, neither <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to the world, but it appeared both large and important {{in the eyes of}} our hero and his comrades. In their circumstances any town would have been regarded as a city of refuge, and their joy on arriving was not much, if at all, marred by the smallness and the poor appearance of the town, which, at that time, consisted of about twenty houses. They were built on the top of posts about twelve or fourteen feet from the ground--like the hut of the Spaniard already described-- because, being closely walled in by a dense jungle, tigers and huge monkeys were bold enough to pay the inhabitants nocturnal and unwelcome visits very frequently.|$|E
6000|$|On {{this point}} the Washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates of former times. Those whom they desire to {{convince}} and persuade are their old friends and companions. They know they are not demons, nor even the worst of men; they know that generally they are kind, generous, and charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober neighbors. They are practical philanthropists; and they glow with a generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling. Benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; {{and out of the}} abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance; [...] "love through all their actions runs, and all their words are mild." [...] In this spirit they speak and act, and in the same they are heard and regarded. And when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no good cause can be unsuccessful. But I have said that denunciations against dramsellers and dram-drinkers are unjust, as well as impolitic. Let us see. I have not inquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors commenced; nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to know. It is sufficient that, to all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of drinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we have seen the one just {{as long as we have}} seen the other. When all such of us as have now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon the stage of existence, we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody, used by everybody, repudiated by nobody. It commonly entered into the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying man. From the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly found. Physicians proscribed it in this, that, and the other disease; government provided it for soldiers and sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or [...] "hoedown," [...] anywhere about without it was positively insufferable. So, too, it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise. The making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood, and he who could make most was the most enterprising and respectable. Large and small manufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested. Wagons drew it from town to town; boats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds wafted it from nation to nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail, with precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer, and bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs, beef, bacon, or any other of the real necessaries of life. Universal public opinion not only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use.|$|E
