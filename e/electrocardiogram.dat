An <b>electrocardiogram</b> can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the <b>electrocardiogram,</b> whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an <b>electrocardiogram</b> and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
40|$|Background: Age {{is often}} the sole {{criterion}} for determining the need for preoperative <b>electrocardiograms.</b> However, screening <b>electrocardiograms</b> have not been shown to add value above clinical information. This {{study was designed to}} determine whether it is possible to target <b>electrocardiograms</b> ordering to patients most likely to have an abnormality that would affect management and if age alone is predictive of significant <b>electrocardiograms</b> abnormalities. Methods: A list was developed of <b>electrocardiograms</b> abnormalities considered significant enough to impact management, as well as a list of patient factors believed to increase cardiovascular risk. <b>electrocardiograms</b> in all patients over 50 yr of age presenting for preoperative evaluation during a 2 -month period were reviewed. Results: A total of 1, 149 <b>electrocardiograms</b> were reviewed, with 89 patients (7. 8 %) having at least one significant abnormality. These patients were compared with a group of 195 patients who had <b>electrocardiograms</b> that did not contain significant abnormalities. Patients at higher risk of having a significantly abnormal <b>electrocardiograms</b> that would potentially affect management were those older than 65 yr of age or who had a history of heart failure, high cholesterol, angina, myocardial infarction, or severe valvular disease. Five patients (0. 44 %) had an abnormal <b>electrocardiograms</b> in the absence of risk factors. The sensitivity of the model is 87. 6 %. Conclusion: Age greater than 65 yr remains an independent predictor for significant preoperative <b>electrocardiograms</b> abnormalities. The specific clinical risk factors that were found have a high sensitivity and identified all but 0. 44 % of patients with <b>electrocardiograms</b> abnormalities that may affect preoperative management.

A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin.

5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft.

5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed <b>electrocardiogram</b> (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding {{as a result of}} trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{feasibility}} of developing artificial neural networks that are able to provide confidence measures for their diagnostic advice. Computer-aided decision making can improve physician performance, but many physicians hesitate to use these 'black boxes'. If we are to rely upon decision support systems for such tasks as medical diagnosis it is essential that the computers indicate when the advice given is based on experience, i. e. give a confidence measure. An artificial neural network was trained to diagnose healed anterior myocardial infarction and to indicate 'lack of experience' when test <b>electrocardiograms</b> were different from the <b>electrocardiograms</b> of the training set. A database of 1249 <b>electrocardiograms</b> from patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization was used to train and test the neural network. Thereafter, the ability of the network to indicate 'lack of experience' was assessed using 100 left bundle branch block <b>electrocardiograms,</b> an electrocardiographic pattern that was excluded from the training set. The network indicated that 83 % of the left bundle branch block <b>electrocardiograms</b> and 1 % of the test <b>electrocardiograms</b> from catheterized patients were different from the <b>electrocardiograms</b> of the training set. All but one of the left bundle branch block <b>electrocardiograms</b> would otherwise be falsely classified as anterior myocardial infarction by the network. Artificial neural networks can be trained to indicate 'lack of experience', and this ability increases the possibility for neural networks to be accepted as reliable decision support systems in clinical practice...|$|R

5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an <b>electrocardiogram,</b> his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E

40|$|In 129 <b>electrocardiograms</b> from 129 {{patients}} showing bifid T waves {{as well as}} U waves {{the intervals}} {{from the beginning of}} the QRS complex to the two T wave apices (QaT 1, QaT 2), to the end of the T wave (QeT), and to the apex of the U wave (QaU) were measured. Eighty additional <b>electrocardiograms</b> from matched control subjects showing single peaked T waves were also studied. The precordial distribution of bifid T waves was assessed by calculating lead prevalence indices. This index progressively increased from 2. 15 in the age range 20 - 29 years to 3. 72 in the age range 60 - 69 years, and was significantly higher in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and ischaemia (4. 04) than in those with otherwise normal <b>electrocardiograms</b> (2. 35). Thus older age and left ventricular pathology were accompanied by a more leftward location of bifid T waves. Exercise accentuated the bifid nature of the T wave in 12 of 18 patients with otherwise normal <b>electrocardiograms,</b> and diminished it in 11 of 19 cases with left ventricular hypertrophy and ischaemia. When 41 otherwise normal tracings showing bifid T waves were compared with those of 42 matched controls showing single peaked T waves, the QTc was longer and the eTaU interval shorter in the group with bifid T waves. Similarly, 40 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and ischaemia showing bifid T waves had longer QTc and shorter eTaU intervals than 38 patients with the same diagnosis with single peaked T waves. These findings suggest that right precordial bifid T waves in younger patients with otherwise normal <b>electrocardiograms</b> probably result from delayed right ventricular repolarisation, whereas left precordial bifid T waves in older patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and ischaemia may indicate repolarisation delay in the ischaemic left ventricle...|$|R
