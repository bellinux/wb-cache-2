5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to power under Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after they developed a naval power of their own, and they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant that soon, Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab <b>fleet,</b> <b>operating</b> from Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|The E1Y1 and E1Y2 entered {{service in}} 1926, {{replacing}} Yokosuka Ro-Go Ko-Gata and Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 seaplanes, with the E1Y3 following them into service from 1931. The E1Ys formed the main reconnaissance seaplane equipment of the <b>fleet,</b> <b>operating</b> from battleships and seaplane tenders. E1Ys were operated from the seaplane tender Notoro during the Shanghai Incident of early 1932. The E1Y remained in use {{until the early}} part of the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

25|$|The Västan is a motor vessel, {{and former}} steam ship, {{that was built}} in 1900 in Motala. She was {{originally}} named Nya Svartsjölandet and traded between Stockholm and Slut on Lake Mälaren. She was sold to Waxholmsbolaget {{for use in the}} Stockholm archipelago in 1937 and renamed Västan. She was converted to diesel power in 1953.

Just before World War II the allocation at Palmers Green was entirely AEC Regents, whilst afterwards it was allocated AEC Regent III RT, RTL, RTW and SRTs the only garage to be allocated all four standard double deck types, although none could fit in the garage until the roof could be raised by 10inches, which was completed in 1952 after a process taking 20 weeks. The garage was further modernised in 1974 by which time 60 buses were allocated. AEC Routemasters arrived in 1969 replacing the RTs, but the RTs lasted there until 1978.|$|E
25|$|The Carolingian navy had a {{presence}} in both Pisa and Genoa in the early ninth century. The north Italian cities had sent ships to protect Sardinia from a Muslim fleet in 829, but {{it was probably a}} Muslim <b>fleet</b> <b>operating</b> out of Sardinia that raided Rome in 841. The period of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries corresponded with a large growth in Pisa's population and in its geographical extent: its walls and fortifications doubled in scope as its suburbs grew. It entered into frequent territorial disputes with neighbouring Lucca, often violent, and its need for imports grew commensurately. Genoa, with even less hinterland to support its citizens and its shipyards, was also pressured into looking for new markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Nimrod fleet {{carried out}} three basic operational roles during their RAF service: Anti-Submarine Warfare duties typically involved surveillance over an allocated {{area of the}} North Atlantic to detect the presence of Soviet submarines in that area and to track their movements. In the event of war, reconnaissance information gathered during these patrols would be shared with other allied aircraft to enable coordinated strikes at both submarines and surface targets. Search and rescue (SAR) missions were another important duty of the RAF's Nimrod <b>fleet,</b> <b>operating</b> under the Air Rescue Coordination Centre at RAF Kinloss, and were a common sight in both military and civil maritime incidents. Throughout the Nimrod's operational life, a minimum of one aircraft was being held {{in a state of}} readiness to respond to SAR demands at all times.|$|E

25|$|Naturally, war {{contingencies}} are {{not being}} planned in a vacuum. In 1979, the United States Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan {{in the event of}} an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and Penghu, but not to Kinmen or Matsu). The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The Seventh <b>Fleet,</b> <b>operating</b> primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier USS George Washington. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it can be safely assumed from past actions, that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.|$|E
25|$|Ships of the Mediterranean <b>Fleet</b> <b>operating</b> from Alexandria {{began making}} heavy radio {{traffic in the}} hope of {{diverting}} Luftwaffe attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from Nelson to Rodney and Nelson sailed west into the Atlantic at 18:15 escorted by Garland, Piorun and Isaac Sweers to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. Nelson turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. Force H separated from the merchant ships {{in the early hours of}} 25 September so Axis aerial reconnaissance might think only Force H was at sea. Fulmars from Ark Royal provided air cover over the convoy.|$|E
25|$|In January 1943, the {{destroyer}} escorted a convoy from England to Cape Town, then made for Victoria, Australia for refit. After work was completed, Quiberon {{was assigned to}} the British Eastern Fleet, primarily as a convoy escort across the Indian Ocean. In April 1944, {{the destroyer}} was part of the carrier escort screen during Operation Cockpit, then again in May for Operation Transom: air raids against Japanese forces occupying the Dutch East Indies. After a brief refit in Melbourne, Quiberon resumed operations with the Eastern Fleet in August. In October, she took part in a series of fleet bombardments of the Japanese-held Nicobar Islands. In mid December, Quiberon was reassigned to Australian waters as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. During early 1945, the destroyer was attached to the British Pacific <b>Fleet.</b> <b>Operating</b> from Manus Island, Quiberon took part in operations in support of the American seizure of Okinawa and attacks on the Japanese home islands.|$|E

25|$|Sayyida al-Hurra was {{a female}} Muslim cleric, merchant, {{governor}} of Tétouan, and later queen of Morocco. She was born around 1485 in the Emirate of Granada, but was forced to flee to Morocco when she was very young to escape the Reconquista. In Morocco, she gathered a crew largely of exiled Moors, and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. She co-founded the Barbary Corsairs with her allies the Barbarossa brothers, who divided the Mediterranean between them—the Barbarossas and their Ottoman <b>fleet</b> <b>operating</b> in the east, and Sayyida al-Hurra and her Moorish and North-African pirates operating in the west. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, Ahmad al-Wattasi to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of Fez, and would not get married but in Tétouan, of which she was governor. This {{was the first and}} only time in history that a Moroccan monarch had married away from his capital.|$|E
25|$|With a {{substantial}} Peloponnesian <b>fleet</b> <b>operating</b> in the Hellespont, the crucial trade route through which Athens' grain supply passed, the Athenian fleet {{had little choice}} but to pursue Mindarus. Accordingly, Thrasybulus, assuming overall command, led the fleet to Elaeus on the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, where the Athenians spent five days preparing to challenge the 86 Spartan ships at Abydos with their 76 ships. The Athenian fleet sailed in column into the Hellespont, following the northern shore, while the Spartans put out from Abydos on the southern shore. When the Athenian left had rounded the point of Cynossema, the Spartans attacked, planning to outflank the Athenian right and trap the fleet in the Hellespont while driving the center aground on Cynossema. The Athenian center was quickly driven aground, and the left under Thrasyllus, beset by Syracusan ships and unable to see the rest of the fleet around the sharp point, was unable to come to its aid. Thrasybulus on the right, meanwhile, was able to avoid encirclement by extending his line westward, but in doing so lost touch with the center. With the Athenians divided and {{a substantial}} portion of their fleet incapacitated, a Spartan victory seemed assured.|$|E
500|$|Parker was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy on 30 December 1913 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander C. P. Nelson. Parker was attached to the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic <b>Fleet,</b> <b>operating</b> off the Atlantic coast during the years of American neutrality in World War I. On 6 April 1914, Parker and sister ships [...] and [...] were exercising off the North Carolina coast, about [...] off the Diamond Shoals lightship. An explosion ripped through the forward fire room on Aylwin, injuring three men. Benham loaded the three wounded sailors and sped to the naval hospital at Norfolk, Virginia, while Parker took on the remainder of Aylwins crew. One of the injured men died on Benham before landfall was made in Virginia; another died a short time later. Aylwin remained afloat but, unmanned, was towed into Norfolk by Parker and U.S. Navy tug [...] The crews of all three destroyers raised $250 to help defray funeral expenses for the widow of one of the men.|$|E
