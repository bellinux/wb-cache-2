500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E

It's curious to me sometimes when I look round at you chaps, seeing you going about 'appy and comfortable, and knowing all the time 'orrible things that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> you. Sometimes it gives me the fair shivers." ...|$|R

"Well, sirs, it {{happened}} that on the morning in question, I noticed that {{there was very little}} gin left in the bottle; for, though I could not see how much it contained, owing to its being of stone and not of glass, I judged from the manner in which I had to tip it upwards when pouring it out. In order to remember that I had to bring home some with me that day I tied a knot in my handkerchief; then, mounting my horse, I rode out towards the side on which the sun sets, little expecting that anything unusual was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that day. But thus it often is; for no man, however learned he may be and able to read the almanac, can tell what a day will bring forth." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nothing {{could have}} held me down, Talleyrand. I {{was born to}} reach the highest. It {{has always been the}} same with me. I {{remember}} when we were arranging the Treaty of Campo Formio--I a young general under thirty--there was a high vacant throne with the Imperial arms in the Commissioner's tent. I instantly sprang up the steps, and threw myself down upon it. I could not endure to think that there was anything above myself. And all the time I knew in my heart all that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Even in the days when my brother Lucien and I lived in a little room upon a few francs a week, I knew perfectly well that the day would come when I should stand where I am now. And yet I had no prospects and no reason for any great hopes. I was not clever at school. I was only the forty-second out of fifty-eight. At mathematics I had perhaps some ability, but at nothing else. The truth is that I was always dreaming when the others were working. There was nothing to encourage my ambition, for the only thing which I inherited from my father was a weak stomach. Once, when I was very young, I went up to Paris with my father and my sister Caroline. We were in the Rue Richelieu, and we saw the king pass in his carriage. Who would have thought that the little boy from Corsica, who took his hat off and stared, was destined to be the next monarch of France? And yet even then I felt as if that carriage ought to belong to me. What is it, Constant?' ...|$|E

[...] Though perhaps under-prepared and unskilled, Nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as Tsar. Nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign. While Alexander III had concentrated on the formulation of general policy, Nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administration.|$|E

5000|$|Hallenga was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at the age of 23. Her doctor originally dismissed a tumor on Hallenga’s breast as “hormonal” leading to a late diagnosis.

[...] I {{was diagnosed}} in 2009, and I was diagnosed eight months after first going to the doctors. I was told three times that I was too young to get breast cancer. I decided that my story needs to be told and we need to get young people thinking about breast cancer and their boobs from a younger age, and start checking from a younger age because I never did.
