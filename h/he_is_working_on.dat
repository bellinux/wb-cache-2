25|$|Las Meninas, {{in which}} Diego Velázquez {{depicted}} {{himself in a}} similar pose with brush and palette, is considered an important precedent for the Self-Portrait with Palette. There the painter stands almost {{in the background of}} his studio, while his models, the five-year-old Margarita Teresa of Spain and her servants, occupy the foreground. From here Manet appropriated the pose of the painter and his equipment, but as opposed to Velázquez, he makes himself the thematic center of the image. At the same time, however, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a painting, but leaves its subject matter, as well as his surroundings, to the imagination of the viewer. Manet himself between 1865 and 1870 portrayed Velázquez in a studio scene in which the Spanish painter is posed similarly to his self-portrait.|$|E
