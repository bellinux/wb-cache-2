5|$|Hill {{started his}} Grand Prix career during the 1991 {{season as a}} test driver with the championship-winning Williams team while still {{competing}} in the F3000 series. However, midway through 1992 Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the dying Brabham team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing Giovanna Amati after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati {{had been unable to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, Eric van de Poele, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season British and Hungarian Grands Prix. Hill continued to test for the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw Nigel Mansell win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to the target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop {{the part of the}} road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

25|$|After {{waging a}} {{tremendous}} qualifying battle with Schumacher on Saturday and securing a front-row starting position, Häkkinen dug himself a hole {{on a cool}} but sunny race day: first, he slid off the track into the guardrail {{at the end of}} the infield straight in the morning warm-up, damaging his McLaren's suspension and requiring a heroic job by his crew to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ready to race. Three hours later, he learned that his failure to wait for the green light to begin the warm-up session had caused his best qualifying lap to be taken away, dropping him from second to fourth position on the grid.|$|E
500|$|The {{biggest problem}} of the morning though {{occurred}} shortly before {{the completion of the}} 17th hour, when the race-leading No. 2 Audi of Rinaldo Capello lost a left rear wheel at high speed at the Indianapolis corner. Unable to control the car he went straight on into a tire barrier. Although Capello attempted to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> back to the pits, it was too badly damaged to be drivable. Television footage had recorded the No. 2 Audi being dropped off its airjacks before the left rear wheel was attached on the prior pit stop, but Audi claimed that this was likely not the cause of the wheel coming off at speed.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki passed Dale Jarrett with 27laps {{left at the}} Food City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take {{a narrow}} victory. It was his fourthWinston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the topfive in season points. Andrews {{attributed}} Kulwicki's consistently strong finishes to the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, [...] "It was hard to control them, and the driver's ability to work with that car during practice in order to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> set up meant {{so much more than}} it ever did." [...] Kulwicki's second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention. He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th.|$|E

500|$|A {{friend of}} Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined {{the team as}} a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some {{practice}} laps. [...] "Somebody put a stopwatch on me," [...] Richmond said. [...] "I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It {{was the first time}} I had ever driven a race car." [...] Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car {{for the rest of the}} event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style. [...] In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway's Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion.|$|E

[...] Using exactly the same ramp design, movie artists made the ramps convincingly look like a rickety old bridge that was falling apart. [...] The movie's director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt.

2500|$|Buemi, having {{risen from}} 12th to finish fourth, was disqualified {{from the race}} after {{technical}} stewards in post-race scrutineering determined that his second car was under the minimum weight limit of [...] and the team {{were reported to have}} added an additional [...] to compensate any weight variation in his vehicle.
