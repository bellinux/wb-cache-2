The implementation, supervision, and enforcement of EU law are left to the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> {{in accordance with the}} so-called national procedural and institutional autonomy. This "procedural competence" of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>means</b> that the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have to provide remedies and procedures governing actions intended to ensure the enforcement of rights derived from EU law.

In an enforcement system where <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> apply divergent procedures, may impose a variety of sanctions and remedies administered by various actors the effectiveness of EU law, effective judicial protection and effective law administration may be at risk. This chapter analyzes the development of EU law concerning law enforcement and takes a critical look at the EU’s aim to harmonize the national procedural rules when EU law is enforced. It will examine the question of which legal basis can be used in order to harmonize procedural rules, whether harmonizing procedural rules would be more efficient than the existing legal diversity and the economics of harmonization will be applied to assess the top-down harmonization by the EU and comparative law, and economics is applied to evaluate the bottom-up voluntary harmonization of the <b>Member</b> <b>States...</b>|$|R

This can be the case if the EU citizen who is subject to extradition has exercised his right to free movement by moving from his <b>home</b> <b>State</b> to another <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Extradition of Petruhhin, an Estonian citizen, was requested by Russia while he was exercising his right to freedom of movement and residence in Latvia.

40|$|At the end {{of every}} European Union {{accession}} negotiation, there is a fight about finance. Yet finance {{is by no means the}} most important element of the negotiations. Matters affecting the vital interests of new and old members like the free movement of labour or the representation of the new <b>member</b> <b>state</b> in the institutions of the Union are usually far more important in the longer term. But it is easier for politicians to talk to voters about money than about policy. The budgetary negotiations in this first enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe were perhaps more important in that these are relatively poor countries compared to the Union average per capita gross domestic product. They all will have to invest heavily in transport and environmental infrastructure in the coming decades in order to catch up with the standards of the EU- 15 and support higher economic growth and development. Assuming responsible macro-economic policy in the new <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> EU budgetary transfers can speed up this investment process considerably, allowing these countries to catch up with the old <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in terms of per capita income more quickly. Higher transfers to the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>means</b> of course larger net budgetary contributions for the old <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (EU- 15).

Furthermore, the creation of political parties at supranational level will enable Union citizens to express freely their ideas and undertake political action. Granting voting rights in the elections to the European Parliament to Union citizens who reside in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> tackles not only a theoretical problem but also a very practical one, as the number of Union citizens who have benefited from the freedom of movement and establishment provided for by the EEC Treaty are estimated at five million.

40|$|My {{title is}} {{a play on}} words: I am using the word “enlarged ” with two {{different}} meanings. The first meaning refers to “enlargement ” {{in the sense of}} the EU. The aim of I-CUE has been to start the process of expanding EUROMOD to cover new <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> and considerable progress has been made in this direction. Although not the main focus of this chapter, such an extension is important for both scientific and political reasons. One of the great strengths of the first version of EUROMOD was that, before May 2004, the model covered the entire European Union (EU). It was an EU-wide tax-benefit model. Since then, the EU has moved on, and EUROMOD has to move too. These moves are costly. The fact that tax and social security policy remain the responsibility of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>means</b> that the model has, for each new member, to add a new and different policy module. But even in the unlikely event of all policy being harmonized across the EU, the addition of a new <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> would require that EUROMOD be enlarged. It is the essence of EUROMOD that it predicts the impact of tax and benefit changes on real people. It is not concerned with “representative households”, or with “average production workers”. EUROMOD uses data on actual households, with their actual wages and employment. For each new <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> EUROMOD has to add data from household surveys or administrative sources. This process may become easier now that EU-SILC is established, but there remain costs of assimilation.

The European Union's liberalisation Directives are often complex and are implemented in very specific ways in the different <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The analysis goes into some detail about the Commission's underlying motives and economic theories for letting network industries, which had previously been regarded as natural monopolies, convert into competitive enterprises with the separation of infrastructure from operations. The study {{takes a look at}} the impact of the European rail liberalisation Directives in Belgium and its neighbouring countries - France, Germany and the Netherlands. There are considerable variations in the way in which the Directives are applied. It is reflected in the way in which the separation of the infrastructure and the transport services within the railway companies was carried out, and in the degree of opening of the market in freight and passenger transport. The analysis shows that the dominance of the former monopolists in the different <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>means</b> that private rail operators face major obstacles. The financial analysis of the railway companies reveals wide variations in economic performance. The combination of better balance sheet figures and a bigger domestic market means that some major players in Europe are financially better off, giving them superiority over the smaller railway companies. This raises the question whether these circumstances will ultimately lead to distortion of competition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the regulatory}} framework which applies to the determination of directors’ remuneration in Europe and examines {{the extent to which}} European firms follow best practices in corporate governance in this area, drawing on an empirical analysis of the governance systems that European firms adopt in setting remuneration and, in particular, on an empirical assessment of their diverging approaches to disclosure. These divergences persist despite recent reforms. After an examination of the link between optimal remuneration, corporate governance and regulation and an assessment of how regulatory reform has evolved in this area, the paper provides an overview of national laws and best practice corporate governance recommendations across the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> following the adoption of the important EC Recommendations on directors’ remuneration and on the role of non-executive directors in 2004 and 2005, respectively. This overview is largely based on the answers to questionnaires sent to legal experts from seventeen European <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The paper also provides an empirical analysis of governance practices and, in particular, firm disclosure of directors’ remuneration in Europe’s largest 300 listed firms by market capitalisation. The paper reveals that, notwithstanding a swathe of reforms across the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in recent years and related harmonisation efforts, disclosure levels still vary from country to country and are strongly dependent on the existence of regulations and best practice guidelines in the firm’s <b>home</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Convergence in disclosure practices is not strong; only a few basic standards are followed by the majority of the firms examined and there is strong divergence with respect to most of the criteria considered in the study. Consistent with previous research, our study reveals clear differences not only with respect to remuneration disclosure, but also with respect to shareholder engagement and the board’s role in the remuneration process and in setting remuneration guidelines. Ownership structures still ‘matter’; these divergences tend to follow different corporate governance systems and, in particular, the dispersed ownership/block-holding ownership divide. They do not appear to have been smoothed since the EC Company Law Action Plan was launched and notwithstanding the harmonisation that has been attempted in this field.

We argue that persistence may not be as different between the two country groups as one might expect. We confirm that one should work carefully with the usual estimation methods when analyzing the NMS, given the scope of the convergence process they went through. We show that due to frequent breaks in inflation time series in the NMS, parametric statistical measures assuming a constant mean deliver substantially higher persistence estimates for the NMS than for the euro area countries. Employing a time-varying mean leads to the reversal of this result and suggests similar or lower inflation persistence for the NMS compared to euro area countries.
