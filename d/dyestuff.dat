5|$|The {{essential}} {{process of}} dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye (the <b>dyestuff)</b> in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the dyebath), and bringing {{the solution to}} a simmer for an extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has evenly transferred to the textiles.|$|E
25|$|These {{gains were}} {{not just a matter}} of renewed access on {{favorable}} terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally lower interest rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to opt for the Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to prefinance Spanish <b>dyestuff</b> exports (like they also prefinanced Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).|$|E
25|$|One of Abu Tir's most {{noticeable}} physical attributes and trademarks is his bright orange beard. The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called henna, a natural <b>dyestuff,</b> which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours. Residents in his native village of Umm Tuba say that his signature beard does help him stand out when he is out campaigning at public events and functions.|$|E
25|$|Cochineal dye {{was used}} by the Aztec and Maya peoples of Central and North America. Eleven cities conquered by Montezuma in the 15th century paid a yearly tribute of 2000 {{decorated}} cotton blankets and 40 bags of cochineal dye each. Production of cochineal is depicted in Codex Osuna. During the colonial period, the production of cochineal (grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second-most valued export after silver. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, it began to be exported to Spain, and by the 17th century was a commodity traded as far away as India. The <b>dyestuff</b> was consumed throughout Europe and was so highly prized, its price was regularly quoted on the London and Amsterdam Commodity Exchanges. In 1777, French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville, presenting himself as a botanizing physician, smuggled the insects and pads of the Opuntia cactus to Saint Domingue. This particular collection failed to thrive and ultimately died out, leaving the Mexican monopoly intact. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1810–1821, the Mexican monopoly on cochineal came to an end. Large-scale production of cochineal emerged, especially in Guatemala and the Canary Islands; it was also cultivated in Spain and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} {{interpretation}} of the Dieppe maps, Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University argued that the Dieppe school of cartographers {{should be seen as}} acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims. The decades from about 1535 to 1562 when the Dieppe school of cartographers flourished were also the period in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th-century height, in terms of the North Atlantic fish trade, the fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative brazilwood. The bright red dye produced from brazilwood replaced woad as the primary <b>dyestuff</b> in the cloth industry in France and the Low Countries. The Dieppe cartographers used the skills and geographic knowledge of Portuguese mariners, pilots and geographers working in France to produce maps meant to emphasize French interests in and dominion over territory in the New World that the Portuguese also claimed, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil. Brunelle noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe maps represented a blending of the latest knowledge circulating in Europe with older visions of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new information often coexisting uneasily in the same map.|$|E
500|$|When kermes-dyed {{textiles}} achieved prominence {{around the}} mid-11th century, the <b>dyestuff</b> was called [...] "grain" [...] in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand. [...] Textiles dyed with kermes {{were described as}} dyed in the grain. Woollens were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then piece-dyed in kermes, producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines. [...] By the 14th and early 15th century, brilliant full grain kermes scarlet was [...] "by far the most esteemed, most regal" [...] color for luxury woollen textiles in the Low Countries, England, France, Spain and Italy.|$|E

2500|$|The Armenian {{cochineal}} (Porphyrophora hamelii (Brandt)), {{also known}} as the Ararat cochineal or Ararat scale, is a scale insect indigenous to the Ararat plain and Aras (Araks) River valley in the Armenian Highlands.

2500|$|During the Middle Ages the Armenian {{cochineal}} <b>dyestuff</b> vordan karmir, {{also known}} in Persia as kirmiz, was widely {{celebrated in the}} Near East. [...] Kirmiz {{is not to be}} confused with dyer's kermes, which was derived from another insect. [...] The Armenian cities Artashat and Dvin were early centers of the production of kirmiz: [...] during the 8th through 10th centuries Arab and Persian historians even referred to Artashat as [...] "the town of kirmiz". [...] The Arabs and Persians regarded kirmiz as one of the most valuable commodities exported from Armenia. [...] The Armenians themselves used vordan karmir to produce dyes for textiles (including oriental rugs) and pigments for illuminated manuscripts and church frescos. [...] Chemical analyses have identified the dye of Porphyrophora hamelii in Coptic textiles of the 3rd through 10th centuries, a cashmere cloth used in a kaftan from Sassanid Persia in the 6th or 7th century, silk liturgical gloves from 15th-century France, Ottoman fabrics such as velvets and lampas of the 15th through 17th centuries, and a 16th-century velvet cap of maintenance that belonged to Henry VIII of England.|$|E
2500|$|Porphyrophora hamelii {{is one of}} {{the ancient}} natural sources of red dye in the Middle East and Europe, along with the insect dyes kermes (from Kermes vermilio and related species), lac (from Kerria lacca and related species), and carmine from other Porphyrophora species such as the Polish {{cochineal}} (Porphyrophora polonica), and the plant dye madder (from Rubia tinctorum and related species). [...] It is possible that Armenian cochineal dye was in use as early as 714 B.C., when the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II was recorded as seizing red textiles as spoils of war from the kingdoms of Urartu (the geographic predecessor of Armenia) and Kilhu. [...] The Roman-era physician and pharmacologist Dioscorides, writing in the 1st century A.D., noted that the best kokkos baphike, the kermes shrub and its [...] "grain" [...] (kermes insect) that some ancient writers likely confused with Porphyrophora hamelii, came from Galatia and Armenia.

50|$|Acute human {{exposure}} to o-toluidine can cause painful hematuria (presence of {{red blood cells}} in the urine) (Goldbarb and Finelli, 1974). Chronic exposure to o-toluidine in humans was also observed in multiple retrospective cohort studies in the <b>dyestuff</b> industry. The results include increased death incidences and increased incidences of bladder cancer. It proved difficult however to definitively link these to o-toluidine in due to the exposure to other expected carcinogenic compounds in the <b>dyestuff</b> industry. One study assessed the increased incidences of mortality and bladder cancer in 906 employers of a <b>dyestuff</b> factory in northern Italy over a mean latent period of 25 years. Mortality from bladder cancer was significantly higher in the employers than the people only exposed to the particular chemicals present in the factory, in use or intermittent contact. o-Toluidine was concluded to be almost certainly capable of causing bladder cancer in men.|$|E
