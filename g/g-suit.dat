5|$|The first {{practical}} {{electron microscope}} {{was built by}} the physics department in 1938. During World War II, the university developed the <b>G-suit,</b> a life-saving garment worn by Allied fighter plane pilots, later adopted for use by astronauts. Development of the infrared chemiluminescence technique improved analyses of energy behaviours in chemical reactions. In 1963, the asteroid 2104 Toronto is discovered in the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill and is named after the university. In 1972, studies on Cygnus X-1 led to {{the publication of the}} first observational evidence proving the existence of black holes. Toronto astronomers have also discovered the Uranian moons of Caliban and Sycorax, the dwarf galaxies of Andromeda I, II and III, and the supernova SN 1987A. A pioneer in computing technology, the university designed and built UTEC, one of the world's first operational computers, and later purchased Ferut, the second commercial computer after UNIVAC I. Multi-touch technology was developed at Toronto, with applications ranging from handheld devices to collaboration walls. The AeroVelo Atlas, which was the first to win the Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition in 2013, was developed by the university's team of students and graduates and was tested in Vaughan.|$|E
25|$|User {{needs were}} given a high {{priority}} in the cockpit's design; both layout and functionality was created through feedback and assessments from military pilots and a specialist testing facility. The aircraft is controlled {{by means of a}} centre stick (or control stick) and left hand throttles, designed on a Hand on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) principle to lower pilot workloads. Emergency escape is provided by a Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejection seat, with the canopy being jettisoned by two rocket motors. The HMSS was delayed by years but should have been operational by late 2011. Standard g-force protection is provided by the full-cover anti-g trousers (FCAGTs). a specially developed g suit providing sustained protection up to 9 g. German Air Force and Austrian Air Force pilots wear a hydrostatic <b>g-suit</b> called Libelle (dragonfly) Multi G Plus instead, which also provides protection to the arms, theoretically giving more complete g tolerance.|$|E
2500|$|During takeoff and reentry space {{travelers}} {{can experience}} several times normal gravity. An untrained person can usually withstand about 3g, but can blackout at 4 to 6g. G-force in the vertical direction {{is more difficult}} to tolerate than a force perpendicular to the spine because blood flows away from the brain and eyes. First the person experiences temporary loss of vision and then at higher g-forces loses consciousness. G-force training and a <b>G-suit</b> which constricts the body to keep more blood in the head can mitigate the effects. Most spacecraft are designed to keep g-forces within comfortable limits.|$|E

5000|$|Astronauts wear <b>g-suits</b> {{similar to}} aviators but face {{different}} challenges {{due to the}} effects of microgravity. Aviator <b>g-suits</b> apply uniform pressure to the lower legs to minimize the effects of high acceleration but research from the Canadian Space Agency implies there might be a benefit in having a suit for astronauts that uses a [...] "milking action" [...] to increase blood flow to the upper body.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1944, Carrier Air Wing Eight began {{operations}} from [...] Part of the Fast Carrier Task Force TF 58 {{commanded by}} Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, Bunker Hill {{participated in a}} series of attacks against Japanese positions in the Pacific Theater of Operations. VF-8 saw their first combat during a two-day strike on Palau. On {{the first day of the}} raid, March 30, 1944, Feightner became an ace when he shot down a Mitsubishi A6M [...] "Zeke" [...] over the island of Peleliu. The Palau battle also marked the first combat use of the 'Berger' Gradient Pressure Suitan air inflatable <b>G-suit</b> that allowed a pilot to maneuver his aircraft more aggressively without blacking out. The [...] "Z-suit" [...] proved so successful that all but three of the VF-8 pilots chose to wear the equipment.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{incorporation}} of highly advanced technology and equipment including escape pods, braking parachutes, <b>G-suits</b> and mixed jet/rocket powerplants, some reviewers considered the film as an exercise in science fiction. However, Paul Mantz, the film's aviation advisor, in designing the centerpiece aircraft models, had envisioned an [...] "aircraft of tomorrow" [...] and had accurately predicted much of today's modern jet aircraft technology.|$|R

5000|$|Earl H. (Howard) Wood, M.D, Ph.D. (c. January 1, 1912 [...] - [...] March 18, 2009) was a {{cardiopulmonary}} physiologist {{who helped}} invent the <b>G-suit</b> and much more.|$|E
5000|$|Wilbur Rounding Franks, OBE (March 4, 1901 [...] - [...] January 4, 1986) was a Canadian scientist, notable as the {{inventor}} of the anti-gravity suit or <b>G-suit,</b> and for his work in cancer research.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, fictional spacesuits were {{influenced}} {{both by the}} real life pressure suits and <b>G-suits</b> which had seen use during the war for high-altitude aviation and also by the speculative articles on space travel which were published in magazines like the Saturday Evening Post and Collier's Weekly by such space pioneers as Wernher von Braun and Willy Ley and which featured carefully considered spacesuit designs.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{pressure}} suits protect {{fighter pilots}} from hypoxia / altitude sickness, and <b>g-suits</b> from {{the adverse effects}} of acceleration (gravity-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC). The most extreme environmental suits are used by astronauts to protect them during ascent and while in the vacuum of space: space suits and space activity suits. Such suits are self-supporting, and include a supply of oxygen for the wearer.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>g-suits</b> were {{developed}} by {{a team led by}} Wilbur R. Franks at the University of Toronto's Banting and Best Medical Institute in 1941. [...] The suits were manufactured by the Dunlop company and first used operationally in 1942 by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during Operation Torch. These devices used water filled bladders around the legs and two 'Mk.' versions (or Marks) {{were developed}}: ...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{with the}} coming of jet flight came the {{development}} of the <b>G-suit,</b> a special kind of flight suit (worn alone or in combination with a traditional flight suit) that protected the wearer from the physical stress of acceleration by compressing the body to keep blood from pooling in the legs. As the pilot executed high-G combat maneuvers, his blood would literally be pulled from his head and shift downwards into his lower body, starving the brain of oxygen and causing a blackout. The <b>G-suit</b> was designed to allow some retention of blood in the pilot's head, allowing him to execute high-G turns for sustained periods of time.|$|E
50|$|Modern g-Suits {{meet the}} United States Air Force Standard CSU-13B/P and United States Navy Standard CSU 15 A/P. Manufactured for over 15 years by Derm-Buro, known commercially as G-Forces Manufacturing, the modern <b>g-Suit</b> can {{withstand}} hundreds of missions without failure.|$|E
50|$|Liquid {{immersion}} {{provides a}} {{way to reduce the}} physical stress of G forces. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures. Because liquids cannot be practically compressed, they do not change density under high acceleration such as performed in aerial maneuvers or space travel. A person immersed in liquid of the same density as tissue has acceleration forces distributed around the body, rather than applied at a single point such as a seat or harness straps. This principle is used in a new type of <b>G-suit</b> called the Libelle <b>G-suit,</b> which allows aircraft pilots to remain conscious and functioning at more than 10 G acceleration by surrounding them with water in a rigid suit.|$|E
40|$|A {{centrifuge}} {{study was}} carried out to measure physiological stress and control task performance during simulated space shuttle orbiter reentry. Jet pilots were tested with, and without, anti-g-suit protection. The pilots were exposed to simulated space shuttle reentry acceleration profiles before, and after, ten days of complete bed rest, which produced physiological deconditioning similar to that resulting from prolonged exposure to orbital zero g. Pilot performance in selected control tasks was determined during simulated reentry, and before and after each simulation. Physiological stress during reentry was determined by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. Study results indicate: (1) heart rate increased during the simulated reentry when no g protection was given, and remained at or below pre-bed rest values when <b>g-suits</b> were used; (2) pilots preferred the use of <b>g-suits</b> to muscular contraction for control of vision tunneling and grayout during reentry; (3) prolonged bed rest did not alter blood pressure or respiration rate during reentry, but the peak reentry acceleration level did; and (4) pilot performance was not affected by prolonged bed rest or simulated reentry...|$|R
5000|$|Film {{historian}} Stephen Pendo further {{described the}} [...] "brilliant aerial photography. ... Along with the conventional {{shot of the}} aircraft there is some unusual creative camera work. To illustrate {{the passage of a}} plane, Lean shows only the wheat in a field being bent by air currents produced by the unseen jet. ... Even the cockpit shots are very good, with the test pilots in <b>G-suits</b> and goggles framed by the plexiglass and sky backgrounds." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{turbojet}} engines were replacing {{piston engines}} as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the engine was so much less than on piston engined fighters, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements. This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape and <b>G-suits</b> to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|On 19 April 2007, a JAS 39C Gripen (serial no 39-259) from Airwing F 21 Luleå crashed at the Vidsel {{airfield}} {{in northern}} Sweden. The pilot, Capt. Stefan Kaarle, was involuntarily ejected {{out of the}} aircraft in mid-air while approaching the airstrip in order to land. He landed safely by parachute. All C/D Gripens were temporarily grounded.The ejection seat handle - placed between the pilot's thighs - had been activated by the motions of the pilot's flight suit. Repeated jerks on the handle, resulting from the <b>G-suit</b> inflating and deflating during the flight, had ultimately exerted enough force on it to cause the ejection. Moments before the ejection, the pilot had taken the aircraft into a tight turn, thus causing the <b>G-suit</b> to activate.|$|E
50|$|If {{blood is}} allowed to pool in the lower areas of the body, the brain will be {{deprived}} of blood, leading to temporary hypoxia. Hypoxia first causes a greyout (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by tunnel vision and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there {{is a period of}} disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.A <b>g-suit</b> does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue. The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3-5 g depending on the person. A <b>g-suit</b> will typically add 1 g of tolerance to that limit. Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body. High g is not comfortable, even with a <b>g-suit.</b> In older fighter aircraft, 6 g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9 g or more can be sustained structurally making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close aerial combat.|$|E
50|$|Pilots in Red Bull Air Race World Championship {{have worn}} a <b>g-suit</b> called g-Race Suit since the 2009 season. The g-race suit is a liquid (water) filled, {{autonomous}} and aircraft independent working full-body g-protection system. It is tailor-made for each pilot {{and can be}} fine adjusted via lacings.|$|E
50|$|Following some 55 {{hours of}} flight testing over 99 flights, the results were inconclusive; {{although}} the prone position concept was feasible, the development of special aviation clothing (<b>g-suits)</b> offered a simpler {{solution to the problem}} of counteracting inertial forces, and the prone position Meteor was no longer needed. Although prone pilots were able to control the aircraft as well as a standard Meteor, the extreme forward position with limited rear view presented a problem in mock combat with conventional aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II the German Henschel Hs 132 (never flew) and the US Northrop XP-79 (crashed {{on first}} powered flight) jets both had prone {{positions}} to minimize blood pooling in the legs. [...] After 1945 the British experimented with prone flying positions {{in a highly}} modified Gloster Meteor F8 jet fighter and the Reid and Sigrist R.S.3 [...] "Bobsleigh" [...] a piston engined trainer. However, other difficulties associated with prone piloting {{and the development of}} practical <b>g-suits</b> for normal seating positions terminated these experiments.|$|R

50|$|A <b>G-suit</b> is worn by aviators and astronauts who {{are subject}} {{to high levels of}} {{acceleration}} ('G'). It is designed to prevent a black-out and g-LOC (gravity-induced Loss Of Consciousness), due to the blood pooling in {{the lower part of the}} body when under G, thus depriving the brain of blood.|$|E
50|$|The <b>G-suit</b> was a {{superior}} solution to another alternative (a water-filled suit) being tested at the time, which was considered impractically heavy and cumbersome. The water-filled, pulsatile pressure suits {{were developed to}} effect venous return. However, Wood and colleagues' detailed physiologic measurements demonstrated that what was required was augmentation of arterial pressure.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, whilst at the University of Sydney, Professor Cotton {{invented the}} [...] "Cotton {{aerodynamic}} anti-G flying suit" [...] (<b>G-suit),</b> which prevented pilots from blacking out when making high speed turns or {{pulling out of}} a dive. This was used extensively by pilots in the Allied air forces during World War II.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a new}} objective technique using a transcutaneous Doppler flowmeter to monitor superficial temporal artery blood flow velocity during acceleration was investigated. The results were correlated with current objective and subjective G tolerance end points. In over 1300 centrifuge runs, retrograde eye level blood flow leading to total flow cessation was consistently recorded and preceded visual field deterioration leading to blackout by 3 to 23 seconds. The new method was successfully applied as an objective indication of tolerance {{in a variety of}} test situations including evaluation of <b>g-suits,</b> straining maneuvers, and 13 deg, 45 deg and 65 deg set back angles...|$|R

Countermeasures such as exercise regimens, fluid replacement, drugs, venous pooling, <b>G-suits,</b> oscillating beds, electrostimulation of muscles, lower-body negative pressure, body-surface cooling, and hypoxia are reviewed and found to be generally ineffective or unreliable. The need for future space experimentation in both humans and animals is indicated...|$|R
