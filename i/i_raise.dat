The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don't wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding {{the use of the}} Koran.|$|E

Transcend is a {{recovery}} community with nine locations in Houston, New York, and Los Angeles. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, he stated, [...] "I started a foundation called the Focus Intensity Foundation, what I do is <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> money for scholarships for people who can’t afford treatment, mental health treatment." [...] In April, he wrote an article for The Players' Tribune titled [...] "Letter to My Younger Self", describing his NFL career and life after its end.|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

[...] When he meets a new business contact, he continued, [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> money from them." [...] He acknowledged that success of his business dealings stemmed partly from his relationship with Bill Clinton, saying, [...] "No question, that's a piece of it." [...] He also credited his ties to former congressmen Dick Gephardt and Tony Coelho, his Rolodex of 5,000-plus names, {{and his ability to}} personally relate to people. In 2004, {{he was one of the}} five-member board of directors of the Clinton Foundation. He told New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich in 2012 that his Rolodex held 18,632 names.|$|E

Lowering my pipe of peace, I say, Kind Mother Earth, when you receive my friend into thy {{maternal}} bosom, hold him kindly let the howl of the coyote, the roaring of the bears and mountain lions, the cold blasts of winds swaying the tops of the pine trees be a sweet lullaby to him, that shaketh the hand of your friend.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{new level}} of gravity came to the {{controversy}} when responding to [...] "a flood of e-mails from constituents" [...] about Ellison's oath, fifth term Representative Virgil H. Goode, Jr. (R–VA) issued a letter on the matter. Goode wrote [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> my hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don’t wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding {{the use of the}} Koran...I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped." ...|$|E
2500|$|During its history, {{the statue}} faced many hazards. It {{miraculously}} survived undamaged the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army, but the pipes having been affected, {{it could not}} deliver its water for a certain time. A pamphlet published the same year recounts this episode. This text is the oldest attesting that Manneken Pis had become [...] "an object of glory appreciated by all and renowned throughout the world". It is also {{the first time that}} it served as a symbol for the people of Brussels. It is also traditionally said that after the bombardment, it was triumphantly placed again on its pedestal. On that occasion, the following passage from the Bible was inscribed above its head : In petra exaltavit me, et nunc exaltavi caput meum super inimicos meos ("The Lord placed me on a stone base, and now <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> my head above my enemies"). As shown by an engraving by Jacques Harrewijn, dating from 1697, the fountain was no longer located on the street, but in a recess {{at the corner of the}} Rue du Chêne and de l'Étuve.|$|E
