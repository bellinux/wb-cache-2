50|$|Detroit was by now favouring annual facelifts, and Vauxhall {{reflected}} that trend, announcing further facelifts in 1956 (wind-up windows, larger rear window, wider <b>grille</b> <b>slats,</b> separate amber rear flashing indicator lights replacing US-style red units {{incorporated into the}} brake/tail light lens, new instrument graphics) and 1957 (electric wipers, larger tail lights, new grille, new 'magic ribbon' AC speedo) {{in line with the}} Wyvern model. Technically, however, there were no further changes until the arrival of a completely new Velox in October 1957.|$|E
50|$|The Jeep FJ Fleetvan was {{a compact}} {{delivery}} van manufactured by Willys Motors and Kaiser-Jeep from 1961 to 1975. It {{was based on}} the DJ-3A Dispatcher, but equipped with the F-134 Hurricane engine. Two models were available, the FJ-3 and the longer FJ-3A. It came standard with the familiar Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual transmission. A Borg-Warner automatic was offered as an option.Right-hand-drive FJ-3s were made for the U. S. Postal Service. Most of these had horizontal <b>grille</b> <b>slats</b> in contrast to the seven vertical slats found on standard models.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the life}} of the Golf MK2, {{there were a number of}} {{external}} style revisions. Notable changes to the looks of the Golf MK2 included the removal of quarterlight windows in the front doors, and the introduction of larger <b>grille</b> <b>slats</b> with the August 1987 facelift. The most notable was the introduction of so-called [...] "Big Bumpers", which were introduced in the European market with an August 1989 facelift. They were available in the US from August 1989 as well, as part of the [...] "Wolfsburg Edition" [...] package. They were not standardized until January 1990.|$|E

50|$|A {{key event}} {{that would affect}} school bus {{manufacturing}} during the later 1990s was {{the completion of the}} acquisition of AmTran by Navistar in April 1995. By the end of the decade, AmTran buses would begin to start wearing International badging on the body as well. To promote the change, in 2002, International redesigned the hood for its conventional bus, dubbed the International IC. These wore vertical <b>grille</b> <b>slats</b> instead of horizontal ones seen since 1989. As it was a change intended to promote IC Corporation, chassis destined for Blue Bird or Canadian manufacturer Corbeil were still received with the standard hood and grille design.|$|E

The battery mode has an all-electric range of 30 km.|$|E
5000|$|The service hatch is {{the most}} obvious {{indicator}} {{of the age of}} any particular A2. It was changed to matte black for the [...] "color.storm" [...] colour schemes, and for model year 2004 it acquired fake <b>grille</b> <b>slats.</b> However it can be changed easily, so it should not be taken as a reliable age indicator.Very little else was changed externally during the life of the car. Colours and roadwheels designs were changed mildly during the production run. The only other external indicator of the age of the car is the windscreen wiper. Very early models have a traditional blade, but starting in model year 2002, newer cars have a [...] "flex" [...] version ("Aerotwin" [...] from Bosch, model 760).|$|E

25|$|The Ford Escort was revised in January 1995, {{although}} it was still based on the previous model. This version had new front lights, bonnet, front wings, front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, door handles and 4 different front radiator <b>grilles</b> (<b>slats,</b> honeycomb, circles and chrome). At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to {{the centre of the}} boot, except for the van and convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality. However, the underlying car was now five years old and most of its rivals were either new or to be imminently replaced.|$|R

2500|$|Park Avenue, {{previously}} {{an appearance}} option package, became an official trim level on the Electra in 1978. [...] Cosmetically, a different grille and redesigned tail lights {{were the only}} notable cosmetic changes that year but 1979 brought a redesigned, flat front end and a subtly different taillight treatment featuring a Buick crest and bisecting horizontal silver line. [...] It didn't last as the 1980 Electra went back to its earlier 1977 roots but with a new <b>grille</b> featuring vertical <b>slats.</b> [...] Also in 1980, Buick completely dropped the [...] "225" [...] moniker leaving just Limited and Park Avenue trims.|$|R

5000|$|The Lancer {{wheelbase}} {{and body}} shell were {{identical to those}} of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were fancier on the Lancer. Lancers featured round taillights and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant's cat's-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic [...] "170" [...] and the premium [...] "770". In 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed only as the [...] "Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop". For 1962, the hardtop model was marketed as the [...] "GT 2-Door Hardtop" [...] and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, [...] "Lancer GT" [...] medallions were mounted on the doors' interior trim panels below the vent window and {{on the sides of the}} front fenders just aft of the headlamps. [...] "GT" [...] emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid and on the vinyl dash pad. The headlamp bezels and the <b>grille's</b> horizontal <b>slats</b> were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the [...] "Lancer" [...] door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended stainless steel door-to-fender spears.|$|R
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{the base}} for the Alfetta GT, a 2-door, 4-seater {{fastback}} coupé designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign. Introduced in 1974, similarly to the saloon it was initially available only with the 1.8-litre (1,779cc) version of the Alfa DOHC four. These engines featured a chain driven 8-valve twin overhead cam cylinder head of cross-flow design. For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier 105 Series (GT1300 Junior and GT1600 Junior and 2000GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570cc) Alfetta GT1.6 and 2.0-litre (1,962cc) Alfetta GTV2.0. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front <b>grille</b> with horizontal <b>slats</b> and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the C-pillar.|$|R

2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic <b>grille</b> with {{horizontal}} <b>slats,</b> and optional front valance with two fog lights. The seat base was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and door hinges gradually evolved out of sight and the fuel filler cap was hidden behind a hinged flap. [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|R

The second generation Maruti 800 that was produced from 1986-1997 underwent some changes in its appearance. The original grille that was introduced in 1986 was a horizontal <b>slat</b> <b>grille</b> with 'Maruti 800' monograms at the right hand corner.This grille was replaced by a mesh grille with the Maruti Logo in the centre in 1995. Also, the Classic Bonnent opener that was placed on the Bonnent was replaced by an ejection button in the inside of the car.The Hubcaps were also changed from the Shiny silver ones to plastic ones. Several new colours were also introduced..eg Bottle Green, Biscuit, Pearl White, Blue etc. The Picture of the Green 800 given below is that of the original 1986 model.The red one is the refreshed version.|$|R
