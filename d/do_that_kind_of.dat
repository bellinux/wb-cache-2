500|$|The {{technology}} that became available to Rockstar inspired them to begin development. The potential {{power of the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 experienced through the development kits motivated the team to create a game that could fully render the countryside, which was difficult to achieve on previous hardware. Houser felt that primitive technology prevented game developers from creating a game that [...] "really did justice" [...] to the Wild West. As an example, {{he referred to the}} animation of a lasso. [...] "t seems easy but we've only now got the power to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff," [...] he said. Houser felt that previous Western games represented one specific aspect of the period, while Redemption attempts to represent all features. In developing the objects and surfaces of the game's world, the team utilized a variety of textures and lighting effects. They also found difficulty in creating a realistic representation of nature; [...] " [...] don't draw curves, but nature is all about curves", Houser explained.|$|E
2500|$|Wessler {{first came}} up with the idea for an {{outrageous}} comedy made up of several short films in the early 2000s. [...] "It's like Funny or Die, only if you could go crazy," [...] judged Farrelly, [...] "because with Funny or Die, there are certain limits. And we just wanted to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> short and go much further than that." [...] Charlie Wessler affirmed that he [...] "wanted to make a Kentucky Fried Movie for the modern age".|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{campaign}} officials referred {{reporters to}} Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb {{and members of}} his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would [...] "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, [...] "point the rifles at them , pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." [...] Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: [...] "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would never do that. I {{would never want to}} do that." [...] Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Beavan hasn't {{anything}} shorter, and he's {{doing up}} his accounts. He can't cut threads on bolts, anyway," [...] he announced. [...] "It's Pete who <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sure {{look pretty}} lively after {{falling off the}} Montreal express. Guess you must have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing before? But our bosses are getting blamed {{particular}} about these free rides." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, {{it would take me}} typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period I would spend anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio time. To <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2016 {{interview}} with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, Media Watch host Paul Barry examined {{the question of}} perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because [...] "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> journalism. We don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards..." [...] Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote [...] "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" [...] while former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes wrote for The Age that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard's {{immediate}} response was denial. He told a Denver television station, [...] "I {{did not have}} a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver... I am steady with my wife. I'm faithful to my wife." [...] Haggard also said, [...] "I have never done drugsever. Not even in high school. I didn't smoke pot. I didn't do anything like that. I'm not a drug man. We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." [...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mention what? Oh! {{about that}} woman, Mrs Hurtle? Indeed I shall. A man who <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing {{ought to be}} crushed;--and, by heavens, if he does it to you, he shall be crushed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{though the}} {{constitution}} should fall in ruins. <b>Do</b> you suppose <b>that</b> a man wants no rest after inspecting all the {{pots and pans}} in that establishment? A woman, I believe, could go on <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing all day long." ...|$|R
5000|$|... I {{never thought}} of myself as a student or teacher, but as a painter. When I paint {{something}} I am very much aware of the future. If I feel something will not stand up 40 years from now, I am not interested in <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fox News, {{allegedly}} {{with the}} Administration's consent, identified and released a background briefing that Clarke gave in August 2002, at the Administration's request, {{to minimize the}} fallout from a Time magazine story about the President's failure to take certain actions before 9/11. In that briefing {{on behalf of the}} White House, Clarke stated [...] "there was no plan on Al-Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration," [...] and that after taking office President Bush decided to [...] "add to the existing Clinton strategy and to increase CIA resources, for example, for covert action, fivefold, to go after Al-Qaeda." [...] At the next day's hearing, 9/11 Commission member James Thompson challenged Clarke with the 2002 account, and Clarke explained: [...] "I was asked to make that case to the press. I was a special assistant to the President, and I made the case I was asked to make... I was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the Administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the Administration had done. And as a special assistant to the President, one is frequently asked to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. I've done it for several Presidents." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All right; you {{can keep}} what you've got, and I'll give you these besides; but I don't want you to buy any more, for I don't want to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{wish she}} wouldn't," [...] said Godfrey, with vigour. [...] "I don't {{care for a}} {{guardian}} angel of whom I have no memory, and who seems to fall on you like snow upon a hot day. If anybody <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing I should prefer a living woman." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{division}} of the emergency department by having patients with similar diseases in the same section (floor) minimizes the need for coordination. The more heterogeneous the patients, the more varied the requisite <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> tasks and the more varied the resources necessary for <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work (Strauss et al. 1997).|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think it}} was your {{business}} to take a smuggler by the neck and haul him along to the sheriff," [...] said Harry with a reproachful air. [...] "Still, you could call out your subordinates and send them off to round up the dope crowd, couldn't you? There must be some official machinery for <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He has had {{her down}} among all our people, just {{as though they}} were going to be married to-morrow. If a man is to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, what woman can be safe?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “There is {{no reason}} why he should not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing—but the trouble is that it seems quite natural to him, as though it was what he was meant to do,” she said.|$|E
6000|$|The {{naval officer}} laughed softly. [...] "From what I {{know of the}} tropics I fancy you are right. In fact, it's rather {{difficult}} to imagine the man I met at the bull fight <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing at all. Salvage work is necessarily hard under any circumstances, and anywhere, but the last place I would care to attempt it in is Western Africa. What sent--him--there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Reception to Let There Be Rock was {{generally}} positive; according to Allmusic, {{which gave the}} album a rating of {{four and a half}} out of five stars, AC/DC played [...] "sweaty, dirty, nasty rock" [...] and the band had [...] "rarely <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rock better than they did" [...] on Let There Be Rock.In 2001, Q magazine named Let There Be Rock as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time.|$|R
50|$|The {{picture of}} the band on the front cover was taken by Michael Lavine, who had {{previously}} worked as a fashion photographer. He had been friends with Sean Yseult and was asked to take the band's picture for the cover despite having never <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work before. The photo made an impact however, as {{no one else in}} the New York City music scene was releasing albums with their picture on the cover at the time.|$|R
60|$|As Crump {{would tell}} you, {{people do not}} <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing unless there is {{something}} wrong with the nervous system. But then, from the scientific point of view, being in love is a pathological condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to point}} out that you're the boss {{director}} of this company. I don't know what you're making out of it; but you can hire men to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work for three dollars a day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No. That was {{the old-fashioned}} way, {{and the most}} sure. But, as you say, it is not rapid enough; and it robs {{a man of the}} power of enjoying his money when he has made it. But it's a very good thing to be closely {{connected}} with a man who has already <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. There's no doubt about the money when it is there. It does not take to itself wings and fly away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl softly. [...] "You couldn't have had {{anything}} to <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> meanness. Larry, how was it they did not tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused when Festing {{looked at}} him with surprise, but resumed in a {{thoughtful}} voice: [...] "When your job's in front of you, you see what must be done, and do it well; there's not a man on my section <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing better. Still, I'm not sure you always see quite far enough. You miss what lies ahead and sometimes, so to speak, what's lying all round. Concentration's good, but one can concentrate too much. However, I didn't come to find fault, but to let you know how matters are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} gravely, [...] "that was blame unlike Jimmy. There's {{only one man}} in this country would <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, and as he hasn't a wagon to fit what you're telling me, it couldn't he him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said quietly, [...] "something I {{should not}} like you too-proper English gentlemens to see. Something not nice. You understand.

6000|$|... 'I suppose I shall, because it's such a lot {{of trouble}} to go {{anywhere}} else. I'm engaged somewhere, I know; but I'm not up to getting home and dressing. By George! I don't know how fellows <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing. I can't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{make a man}} marry if he won't. He {{ought to}} be thrashed {{within an inch of}} his life. But if one <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing the police are down upon one. All the same, I think the Duchess might have managed it if she had chosen." [...] After that he went to the lodgings in Orchard Street, and there {{repeated}} his story. [...] "I have done all I can," [...] he said, [...] "and I don't mean to interfere any further. Arabella should know how to manage her own affairs." ...|$|R
25|$|Eisner {{attended}} DeWitt Clinton High School. With {{influences that}} included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (The Clintonian), the literary magazine (The Magpie) and the yearbook, and did stage design, leading him to consider <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) for {{a year at the}} Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the New York American newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including Western Sheriffs and Outlaws.|$|R

You know, just <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, then started doing some {{commercial}} music, radio and TV stuff. Then I started thinking about getting into some other types of music. I met some great people here in Chicago, Brian Culbertson, a guy named Bob Mamet, an Atlantic Records recording artist, a while ago, and started getting on the road and playing as a sideman for those guys and eventually was able to do it on my own." ...|$|R
