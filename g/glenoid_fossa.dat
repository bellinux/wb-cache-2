25|$|The {{remains of}} an early Upper Paleolithic modern human from Peștera Muierilor (Romania) of 35,000 years BP shows a {{morphological}} pattern of European early modern humans, but possesses archaic or Neanderthal features, suggesting European early modern humans' admixture with Neanderthals rather than a full replacement of Neanderthals. These features include a large interorbital breadth, a relatively flat superciliary arches, a prominent occipital bun, an asymmetrical and shallow mandibular notch shape, a high mandibular coronoid processus, the relative perpendicular mandibular condyle to notch crest position, and a narrow scapular <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lower joint {{compartment}} {{formed by}} the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment {{formed by the}} articular disc and the temporal bone is involved in translational movement—this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely. The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the condyle and {{the part of the}} temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the articular fossa or <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> or mandibular fossa.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandible}} {{is moved}} primary {{by the four}} muscles of mastication: the masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. These four muscles, all innervated by V3, or the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, work in different groups to move the mandible in different directions. Contraction of the lateral pterygoid acts to pull the disc and condyle forward within the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> and down the articular eminence; thus, action of this muscle serves to protrude the jaw, it with assistance of gravity and the digastricus muscle also opens the jaw. The other three muscles close the mouth; the masseter and the medial pterygoid by pulling up {{the angle of the}} mandible and the temporalis by pulling up on the coronoid process of the mandible.|$|E
40|$|Bilateral microtia, absent patellae, short stature, poor weight gain, and {{characteristic}} {{facial features}} {{are described in}} two female sibs. Other skeletal anomalies included complete habitual dislocation of the elbow, slender ribs and long bones, abnormal modelling of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae</b> with hooked clavicles, and clinodactyly. Bone age was significantly delayed and there was flattening of the epiphyses. This unusual combination of features has many similarities to the syndrome described by Hurst et al...|$|R
30|$|This was a {{retrospective}} study of clinically justified, previously taken CBCT images of 45 subjects. Based on a proper sample calculation, {{three groups of}} 15 CBCT images each were made according to their ANB angle and facial pattern: class I (normo facial pattern) and class II and III (long facial pattern). The CBCT images were of adult patients between 18 and 35 years old, with full permanent dentition at maximum occlusal intercuspidation. Anatomical references previously used by Ricketts for the condyle position inside the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae</b> were measured digitally through the EzImplant software. Analysis of variance, Tukey's, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann–Whitney U statistical tests were used.|$|R
40|$|The early Neandertal {{sample from}} Krapina {{preserves}} twenty partial scapulae, from immature and mature individuals, males and females. Their relatively broad scapulae and narrow <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae,</b> {{similar to those}} of most Neandertals and contrasting with those of most early and recent modern humans, appear to be characteristic of archaic Homo generally, and they are therefore a retained ancestral configuration that persists through the terminal Middle Pleistocene time of the Krapina sample. Their axillary borders, with a considerable range of variation but showing a slight predominance of the dorsal sulcus pattern, are similar to Middle and Late Pleistocene archaic Homo, but they contrast with those of Early Pleistocene Homo and most recent humans, suggesting that the dorsal sulcus pattern and the less pronounced bisulcate arrangement are derived among at least western Old World late archaic humans. The functional significances of these variations remain unclear, although {{it is unlikely that the}} axillary border pattern reflects muscular hypertrophy...|$|R
25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (<b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa)</b> of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an x ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice {{three or four times a}} day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E
2500|$|Condylar {{fractures}} {{are classified}} by location {{compared to the}} capsule of ligaments that hold the temporomandibular joint (intracapsular or extracapsular), dislocation (whether or not the condylar head {{has come out of}} the socket (<b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa)</b> as the muscles (lateral pterygoid) tend to pull the condyle anterior and medial) and neck of the condyle fractures. [...] E.g. extracapsular, non-displaced, neck fracture. [...] Pediatric condylar fractures have special protocols for management.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, if {{the mouth}} {{continues}} to open, {{not only are}} the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. [...] Although this had traditionally been explained as a forward and downward sliding motion, on the anterior concave surface of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> and the posterior convex surface of the articular eminence, this translation actually amounts to a rotation around another axis. [...] This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies {{in the vicinity of the}} mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible.|$|E
5000|$|An {{articulator}} {{which is}} adjustable {{in one or}} more, {{but not all of}} the following areas: condylar angle, Bennett side-shift, incisal and cuspid guidance, and shape of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae</b> and eminintiae. By nature, this sort of articulator's use is only meaningful if the position of the maxillae are duplicated with respect to the hinge axis of the mandibular condyles.The majority of these articulators again have straight condylar paths, however the path angle may be changed, allowing the patient’s condylar angle to be programmed into the articulator [...] This is still not a true representation of the articular eminence as it is a flat condylar pathway. Some semi-adjustable articulators have average value Bennett shift/movement built into the condylar head element, replicating the average head shape of the condyle [...] This mimics the movement of the condyles better than some ball-shaped condylar heads found on other articulators Normally this is achieved by the use of a face-bow.|$|R
40|$|The {{well-known}} fossil hominoid Proconsul {{from the}} Early Miocene of Kenya was a non-specialized arboreal quadruped with strong pollicial/hallucial assisted grasping capability. It lacked {{most of the}} suspensory specializations acquired in living hominoids. Nacholapithecus, however, from the Middle Miocene of Kenya, although in part sharing with Proconsul the common primitive anatomical body design, was more specialized for orthograde climbing, ‘hoisting’ and bridging, with the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae</b> of the scapula probably being cranially orientated, the forelimbs proportionally large, and very long toes. Its tail loss suggests relatively slow movement, although tail loss may already have occurred in Proconsul. Nacholapithecus-like positional behaviour might thus have been a basis for development of more suspensory specialized positional behaviour in later hominoids. Unfortunately, after 13 Ma, there is {{a gap in the}} hominoid postcranial record in Africa until 6 Ma. Due to this gap, a scenario for later locomotor evolution prior to the divergence of Homo and Pan cannot be determined with certainty. The time gap also causes difficulties when we seek to determine polarities of morphological traits in very early hominids. Interpretation of the form–function relationships of postcranial features in incipient hominids will be difficult because it is predicted that they had incorporated bipedalism only moderately into their total positional repertoires. However, Japanese macaques, which are trained in traditional bipedal performance, may provide useful hints about bipedal adaptation in the protohominids. Kinematic analyses revealed that these macaques walked bipedally with a longer stride and lower stride frequency than used by ordinary macaques, owing to a more extended posture of the hindlimb joints. The body centre of gravity rises during the single-support phase of stance. Energetic studies of locomotion in these bipedal macaques revealed that energetic expenditure was 20 – 30 % higher in bipedalism than in quadrupedalism, regardless of walking velocity...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Dental {{treatments}} sometimes {{require the}} recording and {{reproduction of the}} patient’s transverse horizontal axis (THA). This is the axis about which the mandible will rotate, when the condyles are fully seated in their <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossae.</b> However, methods for recording this axis are rarely used in general practice, due to expense and perceived lack of efficacy. Problem Statement: A simplified method for accurately recording the THA, and interocclusal records (IORs), is needed for general dentistry. Approach: An optical 3 D scanning method is proposed to kinematically record the THA. A simulation determines the required hardware specifications to build the scanner at minimal cost. The ability to record the hinge axis of a dental articulator is explored. High quality interocclusal optical records are essential, and these are investigated in subsequent experiments. Areas for improvements are identified and efforts are made to enhance the system speed and calibration. Results: Simulation results indicated that all 6 upper and lower anterior teeth, including 2 mm of gingivae should be captured, with an accuracy of 50 µm. The THA on a dental articulator could be located with a radial accuracy of 2. 65 ± 1. 01 mm. The repeatability (precision) of IORs showed {{a standard deviation of}} 22 µm anteriorly, and a mean of 43 µm posteriorly in vitro. The accuracy (trueness and precision) of the IORs was - 15 ± 22 µm anteriorly, and up to - 93 ± 121 µm posteriorly in vitro. A faster scanning protocol enabled in vivo testing. 29 IORs of a single subject took < 2 s to perform. The registrations showed a repeatability of 31 µm anteriorly and 70 µm posteriorly. A novel calibration process produced significantly reduced stereo reprojection errors compared to traditional methods (0. 22 vs 0. 27 pixels), offering a potential future system enhancement. Conclusions: The proposed method shows potential to improve the speed, accuracy and simplicity with which the THA, and interocclusal registration, can be recorded. Further developments have been suggested prior to embarking on clinical trials. ...|$|R
2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and {{bleeding from the}} ear because of lacerations to the external auditory meatus. [...] The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). [...] When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. [...] Bilateral condylar fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral body or parasymphysis fractures are sometimes termed [...] "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral condylar fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who faint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{referred}} to as the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> in dental literature.|$|E

50|$|The Ideberg {{classification}} is {{a system}} of categorizing scapula fractures involving the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{abduction}} of the arm, {{moving it}} outward {{and away from}} the trunk, the rotator cuff compresses the glenohumeral joint, a term known as concavity compression, in order to allow the large deltoid muscle to further elevate the arm. In other words, without the rotator cuff, the humeral head would ride up partially out of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa,</b> lessening the efficiency of the deltoid muscle. The anterior and posterior directions of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> are more susceptible to shear force perturbations as the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> is not as deep relative to the superior and inferior directions. The rotator cuff's contributions to concavity compression and stability vary according to their stiffness and the direction of the force they apply upon the joint.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotator cuff}} muscles are {{important}} in shoulder movements and in maintaining glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) stability. These muscles arise from the scapula and connect {{to the head of}} the humerus, forming a cuff at the shoulder joint. They hold the head of the humerus in the small and shallow <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the scapula. The glenohumeral joint has been analogously described as a golf ball (head of the humerus) sitting on a golf tee (<b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa).</b>|$|E
50|$|The scapula has a body, neck, and spine; any {{of these}} may be fractured. The most {{commonly}} injured areas are the scapular body, spine, neck, and glenoid rim; the scapular body or neck is injured in about 80% of cases. Fractures {{that occur in the}} body may be vertical, horizontal, or comminuted (involving multiple fragments). Those that occur in the neck are usually parallel to the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b> When they occur in the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa,</b> fractures are usually small chips out of the bone or extensions of fractures occurring in the scapular neck.|$|E
5000|$|Type II : The condyle and ramus are small, {{the head}} of the condyle is {{flattened}} , the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> is absent , the condyle is hinged on a flat, often convex, infratemporal surface , the coronoid may be absent.|$|E
50|$|At the shoulder, {{the head}} of the humerus articulates with the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the scapula. More distally, at the elbow, the {{capitulum}} of the humerus articulates with {{the head of}} the radius, and the trochlea of the humerus articulates with the trochlear notch of the ulna.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shoulder}} joint is a [...] "ball-and-socket" [...] joint. However, the 'socket' (the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the scapula) is small, covering at most {{only a third}} of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). It is deepened by a circumferential rim of fibrocartilage, the glenoidal labrum. Previously there was debate as to whether the labrum was fibrocartilaginous as opposed to hyaline cartilage found in the remainder of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b> Previously, it was considered a redundant, evolutionary remnant, but is now considered integral to shoulder stability. Most agree that the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle becomes fibrocartilaginous prior to attaching to the superior aspect of the glenoid. The long head of the triceps brachii inserts inferiorly, similarly. Together, all of those cartilaginous extensions are termed the 'glenoid labrum'.|$|E
5000|$|The glenoid cavity or <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of scapula {{is a part}} of the shoulder. It is a shallow, [...] {{articular}} surface, {{which is}} located on the lateral angle of the scapula. It is directed laterally and forward and articulates with the head of the humerus; it is broader below than above and its vertical diameter is the longest.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{this form}} of {{articulation}} {{are found in the}} hip, where the rounded head of the femur (ball) rests in the cup-like acetabulum (socket) of the pelvis, and in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder, where the rounded head of the humerus (ball) rests in the cup-like <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> (socket) of the shoulder blade. It {{should be noted that the}} shoulder includes a sternoclavicular articulation joint.|$|E
50|$|Condylar {{fractures}} {{are classified}} by location {{compared to the}} capsule of ligaments that hold the temporomandibular joint (intracapsular or extracapsular), dislocation (whether or not the condylar head {{has come out of}} the socket (<b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa)</b> as the muscles (lateral pterygoid) tend to pull the condyle anterior and medial) and neck of the condyle fractures. E.g. extracapsular, non-displaced, neck fracture. Pediatric condylar fractures have special protocols for management.|$|E
50|$|Interpretations of {{the fossil}} remains of Australopithecus africanas (STS 7) and A. afarensis (AL 288-1; a.k.a. Lucy) {{suggest that the}} <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> was {{oriented}} more cranially in these species than in modern humans. This reflects the importance of overhead limb postures and suggests a retention of arboreal adaptations in these hominoid primates, whereas the lateral orientation of the glenoid in modern humans reflects the typical lowered position of the arm.|$|E
50|$|The glenoid labrum (glenoid ligament) is a fibrocartilaginous (fibrocartilage) rim {{attached}} {{around the}} margin of the glenoid cavity in the shoulder blade. The shoulder joint is considered a ball and socket joint. However, in bony terms the 'socket' (the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the scapula) is quite shallow and small, covering at most only a third of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). The socket is deepened by the glenoid labrum.|$|E
50|$|Shoulder disclocation is {{a common}} {{complication}} of trauma or misuse and is often anterior. In this condition the humeral head has moved anteriorly out of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b> The Cunningham technique involves massaging the bicipital muscle in the mid humerus, with the patient's affected arm adducted (close to their body), and the elbow flexed. At {{the same time the}} patient is told to move the shoulder superiorly (up), and posteriorly (back) to allow the humeral head to relocate back into the glenoid fossae.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory of}} Posterior Guided Occlusion (PGO) has a static and dynamic {{component}}. The static component is {{a position where}} the mandible is in a braced, neuromuscular position at which the posterior teeth touch stable, non-deflecting surfaces on opposing teeth. It allows the antero-medial aspect {{of the head of}} the mandibular condyle to be firmly braced on the medial aspect of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b> This anatomical position allows for the maximal coordinated contraction of the major muscles of closure of the mandible.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} an early Upper Paleolithic modern human from Peștera Muierilor (Romania) of 35,000 years BP shows a {{morphological}} pattern of European early modern humans, but possesses archaic or Neanderthal features, suggesting European early modern humans' admixture with Neanderthals rather than a full replacement of Neanderthals. These features include a large interorbital breadth, a relatively flat superciliary arches, a prominent occipital bun, an asymmetrical and shallow mandibular notch shape, a high mandibular coronoid processus, the relative perpendicular mandibular condyle to notch crest position, and a narrow scapular <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{articular}} {{surface of the}} condyle is covered by fibrous tissue, and interfaces with an articular disk (or meniscus) of avascular, non-innervated fibrous tissue (collagen, fibroblasts). When the mouth is closed the meniscus is bordered medially and superiorly by the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. When the mouth is opened maximally, the meniscus is distracted anteriorly and inferiorly along {{the slope of the}} inferior portion of the temporal bone towards the tubercle, or articular eminence, in order to remain interposed between the condyle and the temporal bone in all jaw positions.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{characters}} defining tetrapodomorphs are {{modifications to the}} fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one {{on either side of}} the head for incoming water (incurrent nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). Early tetrapodomorphs such as Kenichthys had excurrent nostrils that had migrated to the edge of the mouth. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana.|$|E
50|$|The lower joint {{compartment}} {{formed by}} the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment {{formed by the}} articular disc and the temporal bone is involved in translational movement—this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely. The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the condyle and {{the part of the}} temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the articular fossa or <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> or mandibular fossa.|$|E
50|$|Allokotosauria is {{most notably}} {{characterized}} by wrinkled side surface of orbital {{border of the}} frontal bone, expanded and hooked quadrate bone head on the posterior side, and a prominent tubercle developed above to the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> of the scapula, although there are other unambiguous traits that differentiate it from other early archosauromorphs. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of Allokotosauria within Archosauromorpha as recovered by Nesbitt et al. (2015). Ezcurra (2016) also recovered a highly supported Allokotosauria with the same topology (including only Pamelaria, Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis and Trilophosaurus buettneri in his analysis), but noted that Pamelaria is nearly as likely to represent a basal azendohsaurid instead.|$|E
50|$|It is {{bounded by}} a {{prominent}} uneven rim, which is thick and strong above, and serves for the attachment of the acetabular labrum, which reduces its opening, and deepens the surface for {{formation of the}} hip joint. At {{the lower part of}} the acetabulum is the acetabular notch, which is continuous with a circular depression, the acetabular fossa, at the bottom of the cavity of the acetabulum. The rest of the acetabulum is formed by a curved, crescent-moon shaped surface, the lunate surface, where the joint is made with the head of the femur. Its counterpart in the pectoral girdle is the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
50|$|At this point, if {{the mouth}} {{continues}} to open, {{not only are}} the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. Although this had traditionally been explained as a forward and downward sliding motion, on the anterior concave surface of the <b>glenoid</b> <b>fossa</b> and the posterior convex surface of the articular eminence, this translation actually amounts to a rotation around another axis. This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies {{in the vicinity of the}} mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible.|$|E
