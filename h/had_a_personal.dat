5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{beliefs and}} uses for slow lorises vary, and many {{practices}} {{appear to have}} deep roots going back at least 300years.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of the island of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E

5|$|A poll {{conducted}} by Ipsos MORI in December 2011 as Lamont {{took control of}} Scottish Labour indicated that the party had an approval rating of 26%, almost half that of the Scottish National Party with 51%. A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour, with 32% against the Nationalists' 45%. The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9%, compared to 13% for Salmond. A {{poll conducted}} by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37% of respondents were satisfied with Labour's performance compared to 41% for the SNP. That survey found that Lamont <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> approval rating of +6%, against +8% for Salmond. Another Ipsos MORI poll for STV in December 2013 showed Labour on 34% with 36% for the SNP, while Lamont had overtaken Salmond in terms of personal approval with +9 for her compared to +7 for the First Minister.|$|E

As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests.

For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for what they wanted to change for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel.|$|E

5|$|However, one Hòa Hảo commander, Ba Cụt, {{continued}} to fight, having <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> history of bad blood with Thơ's own family. The orphaned, illiterate Cụt's adopted father's rice paddies were confiscated by Thơ's father, which purportedly imbued Cụt {{with a permanent}} hatred towards the landowning class. Cụt was eventually surrounded and sought to make a peace deal so he {{sent a message to}} Thơ asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. Cụt was captured on 13 April 1956 and guillotined after a brief trial and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|Until about 1571/1572 Dudley {{supported}} Mary Stuart's succession {{rights to}} the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E

5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed and funds raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E
5|$|Team Staal won {{the first}} pick in the draft, and Eric Staal chose {{longtime}} teammate Cam Ward with his first pick. With the fifth pick in the draft, Team Staal selected Daniel Sedin. His twin brother Henrik was taken with the next pick by Team Lidstrom. The All-Star Game {{marked the first time}} the two have ever played against each other in an organized game. Throughout the draft, Eric Staal selected players that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> connection with him. He selected his brother, Rangers defenceman Marc Staal, in the seventh round, fellow Thunder Bay native Patrick Sharp in the eighth round, and teammate Jeff Skinner in the 11th round. The last player selected was Toronto's Phil Kessel. As a reward for being the last selection, he was given a new car and $20,000 was given to the charity of his choice. Kessel stated he would put the money toward a cancer charity he became involved with in 2006 when he was battling testicular cancer. When the time came for the rookies to decide which team they would participate in the skills competition, Taylor Hall, who won the right via a puck flip, chose Team Lidstrom for his group. All players were allowed to wear the numbers they use in their respective teams. For Team Lidstrom, Henrik Sedin and Dustin Byfuglien both wore number 33, while Brad Richards and Steven Stamkos wore number 91. Team Staal had three pairs having same number: Patrick Sharp and Corey Perry with number 10, Daniel Sedin and Dan Boyle with number 22 and Paul Stastny and Patrik Elias with number 26. The complete team rosters are listed below with players appearing in the order in which they were chosen.|$|E
