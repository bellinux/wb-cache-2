40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the dichotomy between {{the practices of}} the art market and of court judges {{when it comes to}} the authentication of works of art. While judges very much rely on experts acting in the art market, they may not necessarily pursue the same examination methods and conclusions, which can have serious repercussions on the art object and for its owner. The dichotomy unavoidably leads to the questions of what the correct assessment is and whether court judges should be conducting such examinations. Taking account of the difficulties judges and legislators face in attempting to interfere with established art market practices, it is suggested that courts are not an adequate forum to resolve authenticity disputes. Instead, scholars and art market actors should adopt improved authentication standards and, in the event of a dispute, refer to alternative means of <b>dispute</b> <b>resolutio...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} {{of land to}} the development and wellbeing of any group of people is dependent first on its availability and then on how well it is being managed. However, little or no documentation of land transactions, boundary disputes and petit family disagreements among others have been obstacles to the efficient management {{of land in the}} Upper West region of Ghana. The research aims at finding out {{the extent to which the}} CLSs have since their inception, contributed to the attainment of an efficient land management system in Ghana using the Wa Municipal, Sagmaalu and Tabiasi CLSs as a case study. It also finds out the prospects of the CLSs and the challenges confronting them. It then provides practical and appropriate approaches to the realization of the ultimate benefits when land is well managed. The paper did these by reviewing the LAP documents and other literature on land management. Data was collected from the CLSs through direct personal and key informant interviews and also by observation. The analysis of data is done through the narrative analytical approach where the researchers captured the live experiences of CLSs in relation to the primary objectives that were spelt out for them. This enabled the researchers to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the secretariats established based on the different approaches (supply and demand based approaches). The research revealed that the CLSs have been able to ensure peace and harmony in their operational areas through various land <b>disputes</b> <b>resolutio...</b>|$|R

We describe a 42 -year-old woman in an irreversible coma without an advance directive. The case serves to illustrate the complications that can occur in end-of-life decision-making and challenges in resolving difficult futility disputes. We review the role of advance directives in planning end-of-life care, the responsibility and historical performance of patient surrogates, the genesis of futility disputes, and approaches to resolving disputes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to document management practices associated with university undergraduate group-work projects. Various articles report the benefits associated with setting university- based group-work activities. However, there appears to be a notable under reporting of the university educator’s experiences and practices associated with managing successful group-work projects. This paper, through the use of personal reflection, documents student group-work management activities that were identified and refined over a period of time. Arguably, the paper lays out the foundations for other educators to use some of the identified group-work management practices in their own teaching. The paper highlights that group-work projects undertaken over short time frame with small student numbers are more likely to have fewer group problems and be more effective in achieving goals. Furthermore, it is proposed that a project diary or log, when appropriately completed, is an important resource that can be used as documentary evidence in the event of intra-group conflict or <b>dispute</b> <b>resolutio...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) {{movement}} has matured, {{with the emergence}} of newer types of conflict resolution methods in Universities in North America. Mediation, arbitration, ombuds offices, campus judicial systems, peer counseling, peer mediation and other varieties of student initiatives have all come into play on many campuses. The final report (Barnes, 1999) brings together system wide comments, statistics, trends and finally recommendations for the University of Hawaii system based on the situation in 1998 and projections for the near future. The report will analyze each of the factors that come into consideration in the design of a dispute resolution system for the 10 campuses of the University of Hawaii system. Readers of this summary seeking more details on this study may wish to refer to the final report, projected as a working paper of The University of Hawaii Program on Conflict Resolution (hereafter “PCR”) in 1999.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{the law and}} {{practice}} of international arbitration worldwide has increasingly evolved towards greater uniformity. There remain though a few trouble spots for which harmonization appears more difficult to achieve. The role of the arbitrator as settlement facilitator appears {{to be one of}} these trouble spots. At the same time, the search for increased efficiency {{is one of the main}} concerns of contemporary justice, including arbitration. Hence, the topic of this article which examines the present state of the law and practice to determine whether a uniform standard may be emerging and what its content may be. On the basis of comparative research and field observation, the author notes that the cultural and legal background of an arbitrator may well influence the latter's tendency to actively contribute to the amicable settlement of the dispute or not. The author then reviews the pros and cons of an arbitrator becoming involved in settlement facilitation. The main advantage is the increased efficiency of the dispute settlement process, while the main drawback lies in the threat to the impartiality of the arbitrator should the settlement fail. In the light of her analysis, the author concludes that a transnational standard may well emerge on this issue as it has for many other topics of arbitration law in the recent past. She then sketches the contours of such standard. In brief, an arbitrator acting to facilitate settlement must seek the parties' informed consent to the process and safeguard due process and equal treatment and his or her impartiality. These requirements impose certain procedures which distinguish settlement facilitation in arbitration from mediation, yet make it a valuable tool to increase the efficiency of <b>dispute</b> <b>resolutio...</b>|$|E
