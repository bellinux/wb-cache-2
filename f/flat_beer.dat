60|$|McManus {{sat down}} at a vacant table. He paid for the glass of beer that he ordered, tilted his narrow-brimmed derby {{to the back of}} his brick-dust head, twined his feet among the rungs of his chair, and heaved a sigh of contentment from the {{breathing}} spaces of his innermost soul; for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste. The sham gaiety, the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality, the self-conscious, joyless laughter, the wine-born warmth, the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence, the presence of well-clothed and frank-eyed beneficiaries of Rooney's removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed, the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel, <b>flat</b> <b>beer,</b> and peau d'Espagne--all these were manna to Cork McManus, hungry for his week in the desert of the Capulet's high rear room.|$|E
5000|$|A cone top (also {{called a}} cap-sealed can, cone-top, or conetop) {{is a type}} of can, {{especially}} a type of beverage can, introduced in 1935.

Cone tops were especially attractive to smaller breweries which did not have the capital necessary to buy new canning machinery; cone tops could be filled on standard bottling equipment.|$|R

They caught {{a few of}} the fellows on {{eyesight}} + depth perception. What a character one of the officer’s was. He was a captain in charge of testical inspections. He was rough as hell the way he handled your balls, and if you laughed, or curled up your toes he put you in another line and kept calling you up until you didn’t flinch. There were three of us that laughed I was one. And every time he inspected you he got rougher. Well, it took me four times but I finally didn’t laugh. I don’t like those doctors fartin’ around with my balls! Thanks ever-so-much for the much needed hangers, honey, they were a life saver. Thank the gals for the candy and cigs, and for the cake honey. Everyone enjoyed it. We had another parade yesterday, and there was one scheduled for today, but the rain put the damper on that. Thank goodness. My studies are going fine. I have a check in code tomorrow, but that doesn’t bother me. I’ve caught on to it. I finished the alphabet today and I can take six words a minute already. The P. T. here isn’t as tough as it was a Catawba. Yesterday we ran about two miles on the post, sat down for 20 minutes, then ran back. Harry that’s just a jaunt compared to what I’m used to. I’m glad to here [sic] that Charlie is o. k. I got a letter from Dud yesterday he’s still overseas but I don’t think he’s across the pond, by his letters he must be in Panama, the West Indies or So. Americas since he mentions crumby woman and <b>flat</b> <b>beer.</b> How’s Judy? And the rest of the Fullers. Where is Jean? And Jimmy? Give my love to all of them. And all the love in the world to you my sweet mother, I love you and long to see you. Your Son Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Geothermobarometry on rocks {{from the}} Joshua <b>Flat</b> – <b>Beer</b> Creek Pluton and its aureole was {{combined}} with fl uid investigations and numerical modelling. The pluton {{is composed of}} distinct bodies of diorites, monzonites and granodiorites. The granodiorite intruded the still partially molten monzonite. This led to reheating of the pluton and its aureole. Hornblende thermobaro metry gives temperatures of ca. 700 °C and pressures of about 2 kbar. In the contact aureole three metamorphic zones were distinguished with decreasing distance from the pluton: the andalusite-cordierite, sillimanite, and cordierite-K-feldspar zones, respectively. Leucocratic veins together with reaction fabrics between biotite and K-feldspar document dehydration melting due to biotite breakdown in the innermost aureole. This is supported by Na-in-cordierite thermometry and infra-red spectroscopy measurements at cordierite from metapelites. The latter showed relatively low contents of channel volatiles indicating that fl uids did not {{play a major role}} during the prograde contact metamorphic evolution of the pluton’s thermal aureole and that heat transport in the aureole was conductive. Numerical modelling of the Tt path of the pluton/wall rock system resulted in temperatures, which are close to those determined by geothermometry when assuming reheating of the system by a second intrusion. Moreover, modelling suggests a conductive nature of heat fl ow around the pluton...|$|R
60|$|My {{landlord}} {{having taken}} his whole establishment to be salted down, I am waited on by {{an elderly woman}} labouring under a chronic sniff, who, at the shadowy hour of half-past nine o'clock of every evening, gives admittance at the street door to a meagre and mouldy old man whom I have never yet seen detached from a <b>flat</b> pint of <b>beer</b> in a pewter pot. The meagre and mouldy old man is her husband, and the pair have a dejected consciousness {{that they are not}} justified in appearing {{on the surface of the}} earth. They come out of some hole when London empties itself, and go in again when it fills. I saw them arrive on the evening when I myself took possession, and they arrived with the <b>flat</b> pint of <b>beer,</b> and their bed in a bundle. The old man is a weak old man, and appeared to me to get the bed down the kitchen stairs by tumbling down with and upon it. They make their bed in the lowest and remotest corner of the basement, and they smell of bed, and have no possession but bed: unless it be (which I rather infer from an under-current of flavour in them) cheese. I know their name, through the chance of having called the wife's attention, at half-past nine on the second evening of our acquaintance, to the circumstance of there being some one at the house door; when she apologetically explained, 'It's only Mr. Klem.' What becomes of Mr. Klem all day, or when he goes out, or why, is a mystery I cannot penetrate; but at half-past nine he never fails to turn up on the door-step with the <b>flat</b> pint of <b>beer.</b> And the pint of <b>beer,</b> <b>flat</b> as it is, is so much more important than himself, that it always seems to my fancy as if it had found him drivelling in the street and had humanely brought him home. In making his way below, Mr. Klem never goes down the middle of the passage, like another Christian, but shuffles against the wall as if entreating me to take notice that he is occupying as little space as possible in the house; and whenever I come upon him face to face, he backs from me in fascinated confusion. The most extraordinary circumstance I have traced in connexion with this aged couple, is, that there is a Miss Klem, their daughter, apparently ten years older than either of them, who has also a bed and smells of it, and carries it about the earth at dusk and hides it in deserted houses. I came into this piece of knowledge through Mrs. Klem's beseeching me to sanction the sheltering of Miss Klem under that roof for a single night, 'between her takin' care of the upper part in Pall Mall which the family of his back, and a 'ouse in Serjameses-street, which the family of leaves towng ter-morrer.' I gave my gracious consent (having nothing that I know of to do with it), and in the shadowy hours Miss Klem became perceptible on the door-step, wrestling with a bed in a bundle. Where she made it up for the night I cannot positively state, but, I think, in a sink. I know that with the instinct of a reptile or an insect, she stowed it and herself away in deep obscurity. In the Klem family, I have noticed another remarkable gift of nature, and that is a power they possess of converting everything into flue. Such broken victuals as they take by stealth, appear (whatever the nature of the viands) invariably to generate flue; and even the nightly pint of beer, instead of assimilating naturally, strikes me as breaking out in that form, equally on the shabby gown of Mrs. Klem, and the threadbare coat of her husband.|$|R
50|$|During service, the spile must {{be removed}} to allow air in to replace the beer drawn off. Once the spile is reinserted enough gas {{will come out of}} {{solution}} to replace what was lost, but the amount of carbon dioxide available in the system - free or dissolved - is limited, so {{it is important that the}} spile is kept in as much as possible. This is one of several reasons for real ale's short shelf-life once a cask is opened - if too much carbon dioxide is lost, the <b>beer</b> will be <b>flat.</b> Typically, the <b>beer</b> will be good only for two to four days; this short life is why it is important that a pub serving real ale have sufficient turnover for casks to be emptied while still at their best.|$|R
60|$|Cork McManus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly, {{with their}} {{elbows on the}} table. Their glasses of beer were pushed to one side, {{scarcely}} touched, with the foam on them sunken to a thin white scum. Since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of Rooney's had become renovated and spiced; not by any addition {{to the list of}} distractions, but because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones. The <b>flattest</b> glass of <b>beer</b> acquired the tang of illegality; the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and order; the harmless and genial company became outlaws, defying authority and rule. For after the stroke of one in such places as Rooney's, where neither bed nor board is to be had, drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million. It is the law.|$|R
60|$|There was the Canteen, of course, {{and there}} was the Temperance Room with the {{second-hand}} papers in it; but a man of any profession cannot read for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in the shade, running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight. Very few men, even though they get a pannikin of <b>flat,</b> stale, muddy <b>beer</b> and hide it under their cots, can continue drinking for six hours a day. One man tried, but he died, and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave them something to do. It was too early for the excitement of fever or cholera. The men could only wait and wait and wait, and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust. That was a gay life.|$|R

50|$|The Palikur subsist {{largely on}} bow and arrowfishing, {{supplemented}} by hunting and horticulture. Manioc, roasted, or {{used for the}} preparation of <b>flat</b> cakes and <b>beer,</b> is the main cultivated plant. Sweet potatoes, sugarcane, peppers, gourds, cotton, and papayas, which the Palikur have adopted from the Europeans, along with mangoes, coffee, and citrus trees, are also cultivated. Commercial relations between the Palikur and the Europeans began to intensify in the early 18th century; river and forest products were exchanged for tools, harpoons, clothes and glass beads. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century the main commercial surplus was roasted manioc flour. In the 1940s and 1950s an intense commerce with alligator skins took place, until the alligator population was depleted. The Palikur manufacture objects of wood, bone, feathers, and cotton seed. They are also regionally famous for their basket-ware. Shotguns for hunting and harpoons and cotton fishing lines are being widely used at the present. In French Guiana particularly, a growing number of Palikur are engaging in the market-economy.|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2009. Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Geological sciences. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at the control of fluids and fluid composition on recrystallization of quartzites in the Eureka Valley - Joshua <b>Flat</b> - <b>Beer</b> Creek pluton contact aureole (EJB), in the White - Inyo Mountains of eastern California. The aureole shows varying degrees of recrystallization and deformation. Fluid inclusions were analyzed by microthermometry, laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry, and Raman spectoscopy, to define the compositions of fluids that were responsible for the contrasting styles of deformation and recrystallization. The inclusions were grouped into three types based on composition: Type I inclusions are strictly aqueous inclusions with various salts. Type II inclusions are mixed aqueous - carbonic inclusions with an aqueous liquid phase and a vapor bubble with a double meniscus of CO 2 fluid and vapor. Type III inclusions have an aqueous - hydrogen sulfide liquid and a single - phase CO₂ - CH₄ vapor. Isochores were developed using LA - ICP - MS and microthermometry data to determine the trapping environment of the inclusions. The isochores show an extensive range of P - T conditions of trapping for all types of inclusions, indicating that the P - T history of the EJB aureole is complex, and that all inclusions appear to have undergone the same complicated history. This study suggests that the fluids trapped in the EJB aureole quartzites are metamorphic from the Antler orogeny. Fluid composition has played a role in the recrystallization history of this quartzite. It is also probable that the pattern of recrystallization seen in the EJB aureole has strongly been influenced by the amount of strain taken up by the Mule Spring unit, allowing theinner aureole to be unaffected by the pluton intrusion. The higher Ca concentrations in fluids in the inner aureole may also have retarded recrystallization of quartzite in the inner aureole...|$|R
