50|$|Having been re-elected as a Member of Parliament in the 1995 general election, the DSP {{entered a}} triple {{coalition}} government {{along with the}} Motherland Party (ANAP) and <b>Democrat</b> <b>Turkey</b> <b>Party</b> (DTP). The DSP-DTP-ANAP coalition was formed after the coalition between the True Path Party and the Islamist Welfare Party broke down in 1997 {{as a result of}} the 1997 military memorandum. In the new coalition, ANAP leader Mesut Yılmaz became Prime Minister, while DSP leader Bülent Ecevit and DTP member İsmet Sezgin became Deputy Prime Ministers. In this new government, Özkan was made Minister of State.|$|E
50|$|After the DYP {{formed a}} {{coalition}} government with the Islamist Welfare Party (RP) in 1996, Sezgin resigned from the DYP in protest {{and was one of}} the founding members of the new <b>Democrat</b> <b>Turkey</b> <b>Party</b> (DTP).

The DTP leader Hüsamettin Cindoruk did not participate in the government, so Sezgin became Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey as the most senior DTP representative in the coalition government, serving alongside the DSP leader Bülent Ecevit. Sezgin concurrently served as the Minister of National Defence. The government collapsed following the Türkbank scandal, after which the Republican People's Party (CHP) decided to end its outside support for the government.|$|E

Uygun began switching parties six months after he was elected, as the governing coalition collapsed. In one month (July 1996) {{he had left the}} Democratic Left for the center-right True Path Party (DYP), rejoined the Democratic Left, and rejoined True Path. A year later he briefly switched to the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), switching again to a newly created fourth party, the <b>Democrat</b> <b>Turkey</b> <b>Party</b> (DTP) a month later. The MHP had referred Uygun to a disciplinary board after he had supported the government in a no-confidence vote, instead of abstaining as asked. After he resigned from the DTP in June 1998, Parliament opened an investigation on charges of making a mockery of Parliament.|$|E
