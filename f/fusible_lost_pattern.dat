In this review we summarize recent animal and human studies that describe how motoneurons and their activation by sensory pathways become hyperexcitable to compensate for the reduction of descending and movement-induced sensory inputs and the eventual impact on the muscle. We discuss how replacing <b>lost</b> <b>patterned</b> activation of the spinal cord by activating synaptic inputs via assisted movements, pharmacology or electrical stimulation may help to recover lost spinal inhibition. This may lead to a reduction of uncontrolled activation of the spinal cord and thus, improve its controlled activation by synaptic inputs to ultimately normalize circuit function. Increasing the excitation of the spinal cord below an injury with spared descending and/or peripheral functional synaptic activation, instead of suppressing it pharmacologically, may provide the best avenue to improve residual motor function and manage spasticity after spinal cord injury...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the memory}} {{capacity}} of neural networks remains a challenging problem in implementing artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we address {{the notion of}} capacity with respect to Hopfield networks and propose a dynamic approach to monitoring a network's capacity. We define our understanding of capacity as {{the maximum number of}} stored patterns which can be retrieved when probed by the stored patterns. Prior work in this area has presented static expressions dependent on neuron count $N$, forcing network designers to assume worst-case input characteristics for bias and correlation when setting the capacity of the network. Instead, our model operates simultaneously with the learning Hopfield network and concludes on a capacity estimate based on the patterns which were stored. By continuously updating the crosstalk associated with the stored patterns, our model guards the network from overwriting its memory traces and exceeding its capacity. We simulate our model using artificially generated random patterns, which can be set to a desired bias and correlation, and observe capacity estimates between 93 % and 97 % accurate. As a result, our model doubles the memory efficiency of Hopfield networks in comparison to the static and worst-case capacity estimate while minimizing the risk of <b>lost</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

50|$|Because kilims {{are often}} cheaper than pile rugs, {{beginning}} carpet collectors often start with them. Despite what many perceive as their secondary (or inferior) status to pile carpets, kilims {{have become increasingly}} collectible in themselves in recent years, with quality pieces now commanding high prices. What some sensed as inferiority was actually a different nature of rugs woven for indigenous use as opposed to rugs woven on a strictly commercial basis. Because kilims were not a major export commodity, there were no foreign market pressures changing the designs, as happened with pile carpets. Once collectors began to value authentic village weaving, kilims became popular. Three factors then combined to reduce {{the quality of the}} West's newly discovered kilims. The first was a development in industrial chemistry. An important element in the attractiveness of traditional rugs is abrash, the dappled appearance resulting from variation in shade of each colour caused by hand-dyeing of the yarn. The synthetic (aniline-derived) dyes introduced late in the Victorian era abolished abrash, giving brilliant colours which however often faded with time. A second factor was the loss of the nomadic way of life across Central Asia. Once people had settled, the tribal character of their weavings faded. A third factor was a direct consequence of the kilim's new-found marketability. As rugs began to be made for export and money rather than personal use, the local style and social significance of each type of carpet was <b>lost.</b> <b>Patterns</b> and colours were chosen to suit the market, rather than woven according to tradition and to suit the needs of the weaver's family and the weaver's own hopes and fears.|$|R

40|$|Salamanders {{are unique}} among adult {{vertebrates}} {{in their ability}} to regenerate complex body structures after traumatic injury. Axolotl limb regeneration is a stepwise sequence of three requisite processes: (1) scarless wound healing to generate a regenerative wound epithelium, (2) blastema formation by migration, proliferation and dedifferentiation to create a mass of multipotent regeneration-competent progenitor cells, and (3) induction of pattern formation by interaction of cells with opposing positional information. The challenge to understanding how to induce and enhance regenerative ability in humans is to discover which of these processes fail in humans and why they fail. In axolotl regeneration, cells maintain a memory of their original position and use this `positional information' to accurately regenerate the <b>lost</b> <b>pattern.</b> The goal of this project was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of positional information in axolotl limb regeneration and determine if it is conserved in mammals. I used an in vivo gain-of-function assay for the requisite processes of axolotl limb regeneration (Accessory Limb Model) to determine the minimal components required to mediate positional information and induce de novo limb pattern. I found that cell-free anterior and posterior extracellular matrix (ECM) have position-specific signaling properties that either inhibit regeneration or induce de novo limb pattern. The position-specific functionality of the ECM is established by differential expression of heparan sulfate sulfotransferases during regeneration resulting in position-specific growth factor regulation. My findings indicate that heparan sulfates are both necessary and sufficient to mediate positional information in axolotl limb regeneration. Similarly, mouse ECM was also capable of inducing limb pattern in a position-specific, heparan sulfate-dependent, age-dependent manner. Using mammalian-derived, commercially available factors, I synthetically induced axolotl limb regeneration, thus demonstrating that the factors required for regeneration are not salamander-specific. This study demonstrates a specific novel mechanism for positional information in axolotl limb regeneration and establishes a crucial functional link between salamander regeneration and mammals. The ability to regulate axolotl regeneration with mammalian ECM has allowed identification of target mechanisms to induce regeneration in humans. In addition to the fields of regeneration, development, and glycobiology, this novel mechanism of positional information has implications to the fields of cancer biology and aging...|$|R

ISDR region analysis, performed at baseline (T 0) and at 4 weeks of therapy (T 1), indicated that ISDR mutation pattern was not predictive of response to treatment. Moreover, no selection of putative resistant strains in the first month of therapy was observed. Viral load was not correlated with any parameter of HVR- 1 heterogeneity. Among the HVR- 1 heterogeneity parameters considered, complexity was inversely correlated to viral load decline at T 1. In univariate analysis, complexity, proportion of non synonymous substitutions (NS) and NS/S ratio were lower in patients showing virological response at 6 months of treatment. Complexity was the only parameter independently associated with both decline of viral load at T 1 and virological response after 6 months, even after adjustment for confounding variables.
