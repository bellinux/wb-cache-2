25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and <b>despite</b> <b>my</b> father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … <b>Despite</b> <b>my</b> fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|The {{author was}} well aware that his was the first {{cookbook}} in the Polish vernacular, which he made clear in the dedication. [...] "As no one before me has yet wished {{to present to the}} world such useful knowledge in our Polish language," [...] he wrote in his opening line, [...] "I have dared, ... <b>despite</b> <b>my</b> ineptitude, to offer the Polish world my compendium ferculorum, or collection of dishes." [...] Polish bibliographer [...] maintained that Compendium ferculorum was preceded by Kuchmistrzostwo (Cooking Mastery), a 16th-century Polish translation of the Czech cookbook [...] (Cookery) written by [...] in 1535. However, no copies of this supposed translation have survived, except for facsimiles of two folios, published in 1891, of uncertain authenticity. Whatever the case, Czerniecki's work is without a doubt the oldest known cookbook published originally in Polish.|$|E

I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go.

[...] On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, {{even in the face}} of public opposition.
