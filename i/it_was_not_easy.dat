5|$|Fulfordgate {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} of York, {{away from the city}} centre. It was a large distance from York railway station, while the tram service to Fulford only had one track, and the loop system for tramcars passing each other further restricted the service. During the ground's existence, bus routes had not been fully developed and car ownership was not yet become common; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for the majority of supporters to reach.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, {{they were required to}} possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|Wigner {{received}} {{a request from}} Arnold Sommerfeld {{to work at the}} University of Göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently. He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D-matrix. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics. The latter had written a standard text, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1928), but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to understand, especially for younger physicists. Wigner's Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra (1931) made group theory accessible to a wider audience.|$|E

Following Hisashi's high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to Tokyo to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all, and many live houses would not accept them {{because they did not}} fit well into either rock or pop categories. The band had to conciliate their music career to part-time jobs, and faced financial problems during their first years in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|At QuakeCon 2011, Carmack offered many {{technical}} {{insights of}} the development and differences between the three main platforms (Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3), noting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> developing such an optimized engine {{to be able to}} smoothly run on consoles and still having the best artistically looking game on consoles.

25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|Different {{theories}} {{have been offered}} {{as to why the}} magazine failed. [...] Editor and science fiction historian Malcolm Edwards suggests that Merritt's death six years earlier, in 1943, made the magazine a risky proposition, despite Merritt's continuing popularity in the late 1940s. [...] Science fiction historian and critic Sam Moskowitz suggests that, conversely, the magazine did not go far enough in depending on Merritt's popularity, as it only printed three works of his during its run. [...] This may have been because Merritt was sufficiently popular that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for the magazine to obtain reprint rights to his stories.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{dropped down}} to the Third Division to join Peterborough United for a £21,000 fee {{in the summer of}} 1963.

The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963–64 season, {{and at the end of}} the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said [...] "renewed my sense of vocation". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964–65 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2–1 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that [...] "after playing at Stamford Bridge <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up".|$|E

500|$|Aware {{that some}} {{scholars}} might reject any {{view of the}} development of homosexuality resembling psychoanalytic theory and object to studies that appear to take it seriously, Bell et al. noted that while they gave psychoanalytic theory considerable attention, many of the variables used in their statistical analyses pertained to [...] "experiences occurring outside our respondents′ original households", including relationships with peers, labeling by others, dating experiences, and sexual experiences. They added that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> to answer objections to the use of retrospective data, given the unresolved issue of how accurate their respondents′ recollections of childhood were, and that even a longitudinal study would have been open to question. Bell et al. observed that some gay rights activists might object to their study on principle, and suspect them of being motivated by a desire {{to find a way to}} prevent homosexuality and reduce its incidence, while other critics might regret their involvement in a tradition of inquiry that has so far supported the majority view that homosexuality is a perversion or deviation, and be concerned that their study would be used to reinforce social prejudice against homosexuals. In response to these potential criticisms, Bell et al. argued that ideas about the development of homosexuality contribute to prejudice against homosexuals, and that so long as [...] "the heterosexual majority" [...] accepted largely untested theories that see homosexuality as the result of a bad upbringing, their negative attitudes toward homosexuals would never change.|$|E

Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but it takes a lot of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Elgar took full {{advantage}} of the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music. In the days before miniature scores and recordings were available, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for young composers to get to know new music. Elgar took every chance to do so at the Crystal Palace concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of orchestration from whom he learned much, such as Berlioz and Richard Wagner. His own compositions, however, made little impact on London's musical scene. August Manns conducted Elgar's orchestral version of Salut d'amour and the Suite in D at the Crystal Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ voluntaries, and partsongs. Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be within reach but vanished unexpectedly. For example, an offer from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, to run through some of his works was withdrawn at the last second when Sir Arthur Sullivan arrived unannounced to rehearse some of his own music. Sullivan was horrified when Elgar later told him what had happened. Elgar's only important commission while in London came from his home city: the Worcester Festival Committee invited him to compose a short orchestral work for the 1890 Three Choirs Festival. The result is described by Diana McVeagh in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, as [...] "his first major work, the assured and uninhibited Froissart." [...] Elgar conducted the first performance in Worcester in September 1890. For lack of other work, he was obliged to leave London in 1891 and return with his wife and child to Worcestershire, where he could earn a living conducting local musical ensembles and teaching. They settled in Alice's former home town, Great Malvern.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for the HBC {{to drive}} the Americans away from the North West Coast. The Americans had decades of {{experience}} and knew the coast's complex physical and human geography. It took until 1835 for the HBC to gain this level of experience, but the Americans still had several advantages. For {{a number of reasons}} they were willing and able to pay high prices for furs—much higher than the HBC could match without taking large financial losses. The American ventures were global in scope. They tapped multiple markets of which the North West Coast was but one. By the 1820s American ships routinely spent years in the Pacific, making several voyages between various places such as California, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Canton. American ships were usually stocked with a surplus of trade goods intended for trade on the North West Coast. It was always best to get rid of any extra trade goods on the North West Coast, [...] "dumping" [...] them at any price, before leaving. They would use up stowage space that could be used more profitably elsewhere. The HBC therefore faced a major challenge even after they became experienced with the coast's geography and indigenous peoples. The American system not only raised the price of furs but also lowered the value of trade goods. Furthermore, the indigenous people knew that increased competition served their interests and gave them bargaining power. They had no desire to see the Americans abandon the coast trade. Therefore, the HBC had to not just match but exceed the prices paid by Americans if they hoped {{to drive the}} Americans away. Beaver fur prices on the coast could be many times what the HBC was paying in the interior. There was no hope of making a profit. In order to compete on the coast the HBC had to take large, long-term financial losses.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta also {{provides}} the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty's voice {{is based on}} Chicago television's Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Barney's trademark is a loud belch. During early recording sessions for the show, he recorded {{a new version of}} the belch for every episode but discovered that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> for him to do it every time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode [...] "Principal Charming". The character was written as an angry janitor and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using a Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a [...] "big dumb Swede", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas. Mayor Quimby, who first appeared in [...] "Bart Gets an F", is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel's voice is Castellaneta's impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Gil is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. Show runner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be [...] "a one-shot thing" [...] but [...] "Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in." [...] The Blue-Haired Lawyer's voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.|$|E
