5|$|As built Kalinin lacked any radars, but by 1944 she was {{equipped}} with British and American Lend-Lease radars as well as Soviet-designed systems. A British Type 291 and an American SG radar were used for air search. Two Soviet Yupiter-1 radars were used for main battery <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> while anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> was provided by two British Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|Hughes Aircraft would {{continue}} {{the development of}} the advanced <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system and the GAR-9 missile. Development of the F-108 radar and missiles was continued by the USAF and the system was eventually used in the Lockheed YF-12 program. The final configuration for the rear cockpit in the YF-12A looked {{similar to that of the}} F-108 since it incorporated the same displays and controls required for the Hughes AN/ASG-18 <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system.|$|E

5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941 Maxim Gorky lacked radar, but she was {{equipped}} with British Lend-Lease radar by 1944. One Type 291 was used for air search.

5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941, Voroshilov was not {{equipped}} with any radars, but she received a number of British Lend-Lease radars by 1944. One Type 284 and two Type 285 radars were used for main battery <b>fire</b> <b>control.</b> One Type 291 was used for air search, while anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> was provided by two Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of their commissioning, all four of the Iowa-class battleships were {{equipped}} with 20 quad 40mm mounts and 49 single 20mm mounts. These guns were respectively augmented with the Mk14 range sight and Mk51 <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system to improve accuracy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>control</b> {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

5|$|The first Soviet ship {{to carry}} a radar was Molotov which was given a Redut-K air warning system in 1940, which she used for the entire war. Lend-Lease radars {{equipped}} {{most of the other}} ships. The British Types 281, 291 and the American SG radars were used for air search. Main battery <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> was provided by the Type 282 radar. Soviet-designed Yupiter-1 and Mars-1 gunnery radars were fitted in Molotov and Kalinin by 1944.|$|E
5|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} director and the rangefinder. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} exceptions: Turkey's Yavuz Sultan Selim and the Royal Navy's Hood. The Turkish Navy made only minor {{improvements}} to the ship in the interwar period, which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> systems and anti-aircraft batteries. Hood was in constant service with the fleet {{and could not be}} withdrawn for an extended reconstruction. She received minor improvements {{over the course of the}} 1930s, including modern <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> systems, increased numbers of anti-aircraft guns, and in March 1941, radar.|$|E

50|$|The gun was {{provided}} with a semi-automatic loading system with a rate of fire of 5-7 rounds/minute. <b>Firing</b> <b>control</b> system comprised optical rangefinder, auto-guidance system and L2 night-sight with an active infrared searchlight.|$|R

5|$|Florida {{was fitted}} {{experimentally}} {{with a larger}} bridge than was then standard, to house both ship and <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> personnel under armor, while Utah received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, {{to the point that}} when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class, it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the A-10 began {{to receive the}} Low-Altitude Safety and Targeting Enhancement (LASTE) upgrade, which {{provided}} computerized weapon-aiming equipment, an autopilot, and a ground-collision warning system. In 1999, aircraft began receiving Global Positioning System navigation systems and a multi-function display. The LASTE system was upgraded with Integrated Flight & <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Computers (IFFCC).|$|E
30|$|Because species {{richness}} depends on area (Rosenzweig 1995, Adler and Lauenroth 2003), and the trapped area of non-burn (control) patches was unequal to either {{those of the}} Fischer or Tyee <b>fires,</b> <b>control</b> richness data {{were not included in}} analyses of richness (Table 1).|$|R
30|$|Plots were {{classified}} as having experienced either high severity fire, low severity fire, or no <b>fire</b> (unburned). <b>Control</b> patches with no evidence of fire were sampled in the Fischer <b>Fire</b> Complex. No <b>control</b> patches were sampled in the Tyee <b>Fire</b> Complex. One <b>control</b> patch was disturbed by post-fire salvage logging during the study and abandoned, leaving 31 total plots.|$|R
