40|$|Title of the paper: Investigations {{into the}} haem pigment content, {{reflection}} results {{as well as}} into the fatty acid pattern of the intramuscular fat of the Musculus longissimus dorsi (M. l. d.) Thuringian cattle, dependent on fattening system and genotype Haem pigment content, the reflection in visible range and the fatty acid pattern of intramuscular fat (imf) from minced musculus longissimus dorsi (m. l. d.) at the 8 th / 9 th dorsal vertebra of the right half of the carcass were determined in 35 cattle groups with bulls, steers and heifers, representing 19 different genotypes. The cattle were fattened indoors and/or outdoors at eight farms in Thuringia. The mean values of the haem pigment content varied between the animal groups from 6. 3 to 13. 1 mg/g fresh meat. A clearly lower variation {{was found in the}} maxima of reflectance at 415, 545 and 580 nm. The fatty acid composition of the imf was determined mainly by the fattening system. <b>Fattening</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> favoured high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as a ratio of n 6 - to n 3 -fatty acids of < 10. The imf-content was positive correlated to the proportion of C 18 : 1 and monounsaturated fatty acids (R = 0. 4 ** / 0. 5 **) as well as negative to the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (R = − 0. 7 **) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of the finishing system (under montanheira or with commercial feed) on carcass characteristics and dry cured-ham of Alentejano pigs. 24 pigs were fattening until 130 kg LW under montanheira and 24 pigs were fattening with commercial feed. Carcasses of pigs fattened under the montanheira system were slightly heavy (98, 38 vs 96, 13 kg), with significantly higher (P> 0, 01) dressing percentage (79, 55 % vs 78, 11 %), backfat thickness (6, 09 vs 5, 34 cm), percentage of fatty cuts (32, 06 % vs 30, 44 %) and weight (21, 92 vs 19, 77 kg) and percentage of adipose tissue (51, 65 % vs 47, 71 %). Percentage of lean cuts (50, 03 % vs 49, 07 %), bone cuts (19, 53 % vs 18, 87 %), weight (14, 91 vs 13, 77 kg) and percentage of lean (36, 04 % vs 32, 54 %), lean:bone (3, 21 vs 3, 01) and lean:fat (0, 76 vs 0, 63) ratios were significantly higher in pigs fed commercial feed. The content of ether extract in lean+fat was significantly higher (63, 7 % vs 60, 41 %), in pigs fattened under the montanheira system, while the content of crude protein (7, 57 % vs 8, 41 %) was significantly higher in pigs fed commercial feed. Energy retained was higher in pigs finished under montanheira (231, 7 vs 217, 0 Mcal). The dry cured hams from pigs fattened on acorns were more mono-unsaturated and less poly-unsaturated, especially on subcutaneous fat. It can be concluded that the <b>fattening</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and acorns under the oak canopy is considered to be crucial for the quality of the raw material and meat products, as dry cured-ham...|$|E
40|$|Nutrient {{load and}} {{distribution}} <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> were investigated with fattening pigs that: 1) spend {{a proportion of}} or their entire life <b>on</b> <b>pasture,</b> 2) were fed either restrictively or ad libitum, and 3) were weaned {{at different times of}} the year. The N and P retention in pigs decreased the longer they were kept <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> The contents of soil inorganic N and exchangeable K were significantly raised compared to the soil outside the enclosures but with no differences between treatments. Pig grazing did not affect extractable soil P. Regular moving of huts, feeding and water troughs was effective in ensuring that nutrients were more evenly distributed on the paddocks. Grass cover, as determined by spectral reflectance, was not related to the experimental treatments but only to time of year. During spring and summer, grass was present in parts of the paddocks, whereas during autumn and winter the pigs kept grass cover below 10 %. <b>Fattening</b> pigs <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> carries a high risk of nutrient loss and it is concluded that the most environmentally acceptable way of keeping <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> involves a combination of reduced dietary N intake, reduced stocking rate and seasonal rather than all year production...|$|R

40|$|Meat {{tenderness}} is {{an important}} trait in beef cattle production, as consumers consider tenderness the most important attribute of beef palatability. There is ample evidence that post mortem proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins {{is responsible for the}} decline in shear force during storage. The bovine micromolar calcium-activated neutral protease (CAPN 1) gene encodes the large subunit of μ-calpain, which is thought {{to be one of the}} most important enzymes involved in post mortem tenderization (KOOHMARAIE 1996). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the CAPN 1 gene (316, 530 and 4 751 markers) have been associated with tenderness in different cattle breeds (PAGE et al. 2002, PAGE et al. 2004, WHITE et al. 2005). A more recent study confirmed that markers 316 and 4 751 had an effect on beef tenderness (VAN EENENNAAM et al. 2007). The objective of this research was to determine the existence of polymorphisms and to assess the effect of the reported SNP in the bovine CAPN 1 gene on tenderness from a sample of Angus and Brangus steers <b>fattened</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture...</b>|$|R
40|$|Income {{source and}} accompaniment needs of family {{farms in the}} cotton growing area of West Burkina Faso. Description of the subject. In the western cotton growing area of Burkina Faso, the {{variability}} and {{the diversity of the}} income levels of family farms (EAFs) mean that these farms require suitable agronomic accompaniment. Objectives. This article gives an account of this diversity and the need for accompaniment according to the type of identified EAF. Method. The data were collected by the active method of participative research and by investigation of the practices of 120 farms in the commune of Koumbia. Principal component analyses with economic indicators of the EAF were applied, followed by an ascending hierarchical clustering. The structural characteristics, the agro-pastoral practices of production, and the perceptions of the EAF regarding the constraints and appropriateness of agricultural production were compared by variance analysis. Results. The results showed three types of farm: farms with a low-income culture (farmers with few animals), those with a high income culture (farmers with a large number of animals) and those deriving income from breeding (stockbreeders). Taking into account the structure of the farms, their production practices, their technico-economic performance and their appropriateness of agricultural production, the form of sustainable accompaniment needed may be identified in relation to several common or specific innovations of the identified farm types. Accompaniments in the case of farm stock management, and good practice in the management of soil fertility and of animals were common to the three types of EAF. The fodder culture, <b>fattening</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and the method of dairy production were specific to the farmers with a large number of animals and to the stockbreeders. The improvement of the food value of culture residues and of some aspects of the maintenance of oxen were more appropriate to the farmers with few animals. Conclusion. In order to succeed, the process of accompaniment must take into account both these specificities and the concept of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates meat {{quality of}} four {{autochthonous}} Swiss ovine breeds, White Alpine (WAS, n= 15), Walliser blacknose sheep (SN, n= 8), Engadine sheep (EN, n= 9) and the Mirror sheep (SP, n= 10). Especially {{for the latter}} two breeds, which are rare and endangered, information about meat quality and constitution is important for merchandising issues. All lambs (LW 20 - 25 kg) of each breed were <b>fattened</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> for 208 d and subsequently slaughtered. Evaluations were carried out for slaughter yield and classifications, pH-value, colorimetry (L*a*b*-System), shear force (Warner Bratzler method) and cooking losses in the Musculus longissimus dorsi. The results showed no meat quality defects in any breed. The main differences between breeds arose in slaughter yield (p< 0. 001) with SN being significantly inferior to WAS, and CHTAX where WAS was clearly superior to all other breeds. Compared to WAS, SN meat was less colored (L*-value; p< 0. 001) which is probably related to the higher pH 24 h (p< 0. 01) of SN when compared to WAS. Overall, {{this study showed that}} meat quality of WAS is superior with low-land pasture based fattening conditions in Switzerland. It is however possible that other fattening conditions (i. e. mountainous) would lead to different results because Black nose, Engadine and Mirror sheep are traditional alpine breeds which might substantially alter their production optimum...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe organic steer production on farm level. Six Danish organic farms were part of the registration program including 3 dairy farmers and 3 crop farmers buying dairy breed bull calves from organic dairy farmers. All farmers had a steer production, some of them were recently started and some had an established steer production. The experiment endured 2 years from January 2000 to April 2002. Registrations included liveweight, feed consumption, welfare and slaughter results with special emphasis <b>on</b> the <b>fattening</b> period. Welfare registrations were based on a scheme describing the system as well as the animal during winter when stabled in the barn and during summer <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> Registrations were measured on the system as well on the animals. Daily gain <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> varied from 533 to 823 g and covers grazing <b>on</b> ryegrass/clover <b>pastures</b> as well as marginal grazing areas. On most of the farms steers grazed both kind of pastures. Gains during the stable period varied from 562 to 867 g/day between the farms. Feed consumption per steer per year was 1770 SFU ± 186 based on 4 farms. Feed consumption in summer accounted 0. 47 to 0. 57 of total feed consumption (DM) per year. Pasture accounts for 0. 22 to 0. 56 and concentrates for 0. 16 to 0. 37 of the total dry matter (DM) consumption per year. Management strategies concerning the fattening of steers were different between the 6 farms, as liveweight (458 - 595 kg) and age (20 - 25 months) at start of fattening and at slaughter (565 - 667 kg and 23 - 28 months) and length of fattening period (2. 3 - 3. 4 months) varied. Feeding during the fattening period was based on 1. 3 to 4. 7 Scandinavian Feed Units (SFU) concentrates per steer per day and silage ad libitum. The total amount of cereals consumed in the fattening period was 100 - 357 kg/steer. Only few steers were <b>fattened</b> <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> It seemed that whole crop silage is preferred to grass silage in the fattening period. Slaughter results show a variation between farms in slaughter percentage from 49. 4 to 53. 8, carcass conformation from 3. 5 to 4. 9 and fatness from 2. 5 to 3. 2. Liveweight at slaughter was the only variable with general effect on carcass conformation on 5 farms (0. 6 point on the EUROP-scale with increase in 100 kg liveweight at slaughter). The welfare registration scheme indicates good conditions both in the barn and <b>on</b> <b>pasture,</b> low disease rate and minor problems concerning welfare aspects in organic steer production. It is concluded that great variation between farms concerning management strategies shows the possibilities for improving the production system. Fattening strategy should focus on liveweight at slaughter. Length of fattening period as well as daily gain during the fattening period in the range practiced on the farms seemed to be of minor importance with regard to carcass conformation...|$|R
40|$|Last {{year at the}} Livestock Feeders' Day, {{results of}} {{experiments}} were given {{on the use of}} mustard seed oil meal as a protein supplement for <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>on</b> alfalfa <b>pasture.</b> The results showed that mustard seed oil meal was an excellent protein feed when mixed with tankage and other protein supplements and self-fed free choice. Generally the gains were as cheap or cheaper than where tankage alone was fed and the daily gain were somewhat more rapid with a lower feed consumption. In the tests reported last year the mustard seed oil meal made up as much as 50 percent of the protein mixtures with tankage in some of the lots and at this level proved to be entirely palatable. The results of feeding it in such large proportions were so satisfactory that it was desired to ascertain whether it were possible to increase further the amount of mustard seed meal in the mixture with tankage and still get good results. Consequently two lots of pigs were fed this past summer with an increased percentage of the mustard seed oil meal...|$|R

40|$|The Kuri is a rare, {{little known}} breed of cattle of the Hamitic Longhorn (Bos taurus longifrons) type which is {{found on the}} islands and shores of Lake Chad Basin in the area {{covering}} the common borders of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. It is taller and more massive than its longhorn counterpart, the trypanotolerant N'Dama. The Kuri is trypanosusceptible. It is a dual-purpose milk-and-meat breed which is tolerant of insect bites and has excellent swimming abilities. It has unique bulbous horns which are believed to aid in flotation as it searches for water weeds, its main food. The Kuri is very well adapted to the aquatic conditions of the Lake but is susceptible to heat stress and solar radiation. The breed is quite fertile, with a reported age at first calving as early as 36 months and a calving interval as short as 15 months. Indeed, the Kuri cow can produce as many as 12 calves in her lifetime. The cow is capable of producing as much as 6 kg of milk a day after feeding her calf and <b>fattens</b> well <b>on</b> <b>pasture</b> and in feedlot. Meat quality of the Kuri is considered exceptional. The limited data on its population and distribution suggest that the Kuri can only survive in the environs {{of the lake and}} is rapidly declining in numbers. Possible reasons for the declining trend include drought, protracted civil conflicts in the region, the retreating waters of the Lake and extensive crossbreeding with the Zebus when they graze on the shores. The trend is exacerbated by lack of improvement programmes for the breed. The authors suggest immediate action to assess the extent of Zebu introgression and the establishment of a breeding/multiplication centre in the Lake area for characterization, enhancement and conservation of the breed...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} bulletin reported {{results from}} an experiment designed to predict substitution rates and economic optima in corn/soybean oilmeal rations for growing and fattening hogs in drylot. 2 Principles and analytical models were included which illustrate that the least-cost ration depends both on (1) the marginal rate of substitution between feeds and (2) {{the ratio of}} feed prices. These basic concepts will not be repeated in this bulletin. Since more hogs are farrowed in spring than in fall, the research reported {{in this study was}} conducted for growing and <b>fattening</b> hogs raised <b>on</b> <b>pasture.</b> Like the drylot study, the objectives of the pasture experiment were to estimate: (1) the production function, (2) the substitution rate between corn and soybean oilmeal at different points on the production surface, (3) the least-cost ration for different soybean oilmeal/corn price ratios, (4) the relationship between the rate of hog gains and the input of corn and soybean oilmeal and (5) the proportion of the years in which a least-cost feeding system results in greater profits than a least-time feeding system. Substitution between major classes of feed such as corn and soybean oilmeal is possible mainly where the rations are fortified with appropriate quantities of trace minerals (as well as antibiotics in the case of drylot feeding). These fortifying elements have been included in the rations of this study...|$|R
