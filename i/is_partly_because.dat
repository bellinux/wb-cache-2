5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 {{males in the}} island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the {{national}} average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E

60|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{had taken}} it into his head to visit the Green Forest. It <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> he hadn't {{anything}} else to do, and it <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{now that it was}} very near the end of winter he wanted to see how things were there and if there were any signs of the coming of spring. Blacky the Crow saw him coming, and Blacky chuckled to himself. He had watched every day for a week for just this thing. Now he would tell Farmer Brown's boy about that nest of Hooty the Owl.|$|R
25|$|This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{attitudes of}} racial superiority were the norm among white Americans of that era, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the NAWSA {{believed}} it had {{little hope of}} achieving a national amendment without at least some support from southern states that practiced racial segregation.|$|R
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the latest of the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the subject matter, which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
50|$|If red, blue, {{and green}} light (the {{additive}} primaries) are mixed, {{the result is}} something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> subtractive mixing of the pigments <b>is</b> avoided, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.|$|R
50|$|There has {{not been}} {{significant}} debate about how influential the protests <b>were.</b> <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> the issue of refugees and mandatory detention had been well established as political issues long before the protests started.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} nothing {{was known about}} {{juvenile}} Polypterus. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> its habitat <b>was</b> remote and inhospitable and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of recurring warfare until the late 1890s. Budgett worked to fill this gap {{for five years and}} eventually succeeded, but only at the cost of his life ...|$|R
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{the field is}} located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt {{is located in a}} highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E
5|$|The Library {{holds an}} almost {{complete}} collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{of the legal}} deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing {{tens of millions of}} newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} one single dose is much longer (6 to 8 hr) than the very short {{half-life}} {{of the drug}} indicates. This could <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it persists for over 11 hours in synovial fluids.|$|R

5000|$|The {{success of}} the {{coalition}} <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the popularity of its main man, Vice President Joseph Estrada who won the elections. His senatorial slate also gained majority of 7 out of 12 available seats in the Senate.They were: ...|$|R
25|$|Many, even Catholics, {{are unaware}} or only dimly {{aware that the}} Catholic Church has Western and Eastern branches. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because,</b> outside the Middle East, Africa, and India, Eastern Catholics are a small {{fraction}} of the total number of Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Acidosis such as {{caused by}} {{inflammation}} at a wound partly reduces {{the action of}} LAs. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> most of the anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the sodium channel.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{first-class}} counties play three-day {{games against}} university cricket {{teams in the}} early part of the English cricket season. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the start of the cricket season coincides with the end of the university academic year, and partly because the games act as pre-season warm-ups for the county clubs.|$|E
5000|$|This release {{credited}} Stuart Damon as the star, with Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt receiving co-star credits. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Damon <b>was</b> {{a well-established}} {{star in the}} U.S. by this time, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> [...] "The Interrogation" [...] is essentially a two-hander between Damon and Colin Blakely, {{with the rest of}} the regular cast appearing only briefly.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, he {{challenged}} Lady Megan again, but she beat him by 2,000 votes. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because,</b> although a Liberal, she had identified with Labour. In 1951 general election, however, when Labour lost ground nationally, he ousted her by 595 votes.|$|R
5000|$|Class C was {{assigned}} to the 0-8-0 type. These were very common on other railroads, but the PRR was not keen on them and only built a few. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the PRR used 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidation" [...] types for similar service.|$|R
25|$|Much {{speculation}} about the lovebug still thrives. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the larval form of this insect is seldom seen, as it lives and feeds in the thatch of grasses {{for most of the}} year. While various fungi are suspected of being natural controls for this species, biological control of these non-pest flies is not a priority for funding.|$|E
25|$|The {{beaches of}} the western coast and the northernmost part of the east coast are often rocky, with some sandy beaches due to local conditions; while the {{southern}} and eastern beaches are typically sandy and dune-covered. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the prevailing winds from the west (which also cause thick layers of ice {{to build on the}} eastern shore in winter).|$|E
25|$|The Navier–Stokes equations, {{even when}} written {{explicitly}} for specific fluids, are rather generic {{in nature and}} their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{there is an enormous}} variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as multiphase flow driven by surface tension.|$|E
50|$|The Union Nationale, {{which had}} governed Quebec {{through most of}} the 1940s and 1950s, would never come close to winning power again. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> a {{significant}} number of the Union Nationale's younger supporters had embraced sovereigntism, and shifted their support to the PQ.|$|R
50|$|The establishments which {{operated}} under the official JSSL name operated {{from a large}} number of different sites during its history. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the course had two distinct elements; an initial 'linguists' course, and a subsequent, and more advanced, 'University' element to produce interpreters.|$|R

25|$|Winning singles, {{doubles and}} mixed doubles titles at one Grand Slam event {{is called a}} Triple Crown. It has become a rare {{accomplishment}} in tennis. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the final match in all three disciplines often takes place concurrently in the same day if not in consecutive days. Doris Hart for example attained her first Triple Crown after playing three Wimbledon final matches held in one single day.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} to an entrenched {{bill of rights}} in New Zealand <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the country is currently governed by parliamentary sovereignty. Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament’s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not regarded as the courts’ responsibility, but instead seen as requiring involvement by all branches of government.|$|E
50|$|Following Michel's removal Gallieni, {{who was the}} {{preferred}} choice of Prime Minister Caillaux, declined the job of Army Chief of Staff. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of scruples after having forced Michel out, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of age—he <b>was</b> {{two and a half}} years away from retirement—and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the Metropolitan Army might resent a colonial soldier getting the job (“un question de bouton”). His former subordinate Joffre was appointed instead.|$|R
