5|$|He was {{preoccupied with}} his own security, {{regularly}} changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in Libya when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying.</b> He made particular requests when traveling to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers, and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July 1943 the P-51 Mustang {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> {{was hit by}} German flak or {{suffered}} engine failure and crashed over France. The Germans reported him as {{a prisoner of war}} but he died in a military hospital from his injuries. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC on 30 July 1943 in absentia. During the course of his combat career he flew the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> {{from his home in}} Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license.|$|E
50|$|Jake Barnes (Dirk Benedict) <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> a plane {{over the}} Alaskan wilderness. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>flying,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{communicating}} {{with a man}} named Charlie (Ben Cardinal), who works for Quincy Air Service.|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the glare of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E

50|$|Prodigy's costume is mystically {{infused with}} power, giving him vast superhuman strength, speed, and stamina. He can leap {{incredible}} distances {{and when he}} jumps, it appears that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>flying.</b> His golden costume is completely bulletproof, and can withstand most physical assaults. His cape functions as a hang glider, and enables him to glide on air currents.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{initially}} {{announcing a}} break after supporting Wasting Light, Grohl later stated in January 2013 that the band had started writing material for an eighth studio album. On February 20, 2013, at the Brit Awards, Grohl said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> back to America {{the following day}} to start work on the next album.|$|E
25|$|Some {{who were}} with Mantz during the shoot dispute that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> under the influence, {{although}} they acknowledge {{he was drinking}} alcohol {{the night before the}} fatal flight. Toxicology tests were performed several hours after the accident; in the absence of refrigeration, normal postmortem biochemical processes might produce blood ethanol and cause or contribute to an elevated BAC level.|$|E
25|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after his nomination, it was {{revealed}} that Thomas Eagleton had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s. Eagleton had made no mention of his earlier hospitalizations to McGovern or McGovern's staff, and in fact decided with his wife to keep them secret from McGovern while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> to his first meeting with the Presidential nominee.|$|E
50|$|H enters {{now into}} an {{airfield}} where he meets {{the man with}} blue shades, and they take a plane flying over the continent of Europe, the new scale, as they head towards the Montfossis (a range of fake mountains cartographers used to put on maps to converge two ranges on a map). H falls asleep again and in his dream <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> over the maps in an exhibition (such as an 18th-century Japanese map), in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now traveling not in space, but in time. Next, H finds himself flying over multiple labyrinth maps with the man as the man says {{they are in the}} eye of the dice. As they depart the eye of the dice a new dice is being thrown which changes the scale and leads the whole planet Earth to play the game. The thin air in which H <b>is</b> in as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>flying</b> in the plane leads H to lose consciousness.|$|R

25|$|The {{navigator}} on the Lady Be Good thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> on {{a direct}} path from Naples to Benghazi. But the base's radio direction finder {{only had a}} single loop antenna. As the plane's direction finder could not distinguish between a signal in front or behind the aircraft, {{there was no way}} to identify reciprocal readings. The same bearing would be returned whether the plane was heading inbound from the Mediterranean or outbound inland.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Air Forces has the top Allied {{pilots in}} terms of aerial victories, Ivan Kozhedub {{credited}} with 66 victories and Alexander Pokryshkin scored 65 victories.

Fighting on different sides, the French pilot Pierre Le Gloan had the unusual distinction of shooting down four German, seven Italian and seven British aircraft, the latter while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> for Vichy France in Syria.|$|E
25|$|In January 1968, {{four months}} into his second tour, Crandall's {{helicopter}} was downed during another rescue attempt due to Air Force bombs going off {{too close to}} where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying.</b> After five months in the hospital recovering from a broken back and other injuries, he resumed {{his career as a}} student, earning a bootstrap degree through the University of Nebraska in 1969. Assigned to Bangkok, Thailand, he became a facility engineer managing 3800 people. He subsequently served as deputy chief of staff, deputy installation commander, and commander of the 5th Engineer Combat Battalion, all at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri.|$|E

50|$|Arlequin {{is being}} pursued by his debtors, so his friend Boubekir gives him a flying box {{so that he can}} flee the country.

Arlequin agrees to help.|$|R
60|$|This done, without uttering another word, he vaulted {{into his}} saddle, and dashed {{away as if}} <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> for his life. The old woman listened until the clatter of his horse's hoofs ceased to beat upon her deadened ear, and then bent her head, as at the first, in calm resignation. Doubtless she fancied that another fellow-creature had forsaken her, and that the end would soon come.|$|R
