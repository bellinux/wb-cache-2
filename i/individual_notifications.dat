40|$|The {{issue of}} notifying {{people who have}} been exposed to blood {{products}} that have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has arisen {{at a time when the}} Canadian blood system is under intense scrutiny. As a result, the Canadian Red Cross Society issued a recommendation to health care institutions that recipients of CJD-associated blood products be identified, notified and counselled. Although Canadian jurisprudence in the realm of informed consent may support a policy of <b>individual</b> <b>notification,</b> a review of the scientific evidence and the applicable ethical principles arguably favours a policy of a more general public notification. Indeed, situations such as this require a unique approach to the formation of legal and ethical duties, one that effectively integrates all relevant factors. As such, the authors argue that <b>individual</b> <b>notification</b> is currently not justified. Nevertheless, if a system of general notification is implemented (e. g., through a series of public health announcements), it should provide, for people who wish to know, the opportunity to find out whether they were given CJD-associated products...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{what percentage of}} Victorians {{with a history of}} notified hepatitis C exposure received appropriate follow-up diagnostic services between 2001 and 2012. METHODS: <b>Individual</b> <b>notification</b> data and aggregate Medicare and supplementary testing data were entered into a compartmental transition model, which was used to estimate the percentage of people with a hepatitis C notification who were yet to receive either a negative diagnostic test for viral nucleic acid, or a test for viral genotype, at the end of 2012. RESULTS: We estimate that 58. 2 % (uncertainty interval: 42. 2 %, 72. 4 %) of Victorians with a hepatitis C notification between 2001 and 2012 did not receive either a negative test for viral nucleic acid or a viral genotyping test during the study period. At the end of 2012, we estimate there were approximately 20, 400 Victorians living with hepatitis C antibodies who were yet to receive testing, of which approximately 9, 300 would have been aged 45 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of people living with HCV antibodies in Victoria had not received appropriate secondary diagnostic services as of the end of 2012. IMPLICATIONS: As improved therapeutic options become available for people living with chronic hepatitis C, measures to support appropriate follow-up of people with suspected or confirmed chronic infections via primary care services will be required.

Continued operation of the facility and authorization under the current mining lease may be in question. If the lease is terminated, the leased area will {{be removed from the}} geothermal resource subzone area and adjacent landowner notification may be required. Certain geothermal activities can only be permitted within geothermal resource subzones. The AG was to issue an opinion that since the well has been plugged and abandoned and there is no geothermal activity, automatic lease termination is an option. Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) was selected by NELHA to operate the Noii O Puna research facility in December 2001. An option is to set aside the leased area (not the geothermal resource) by executive order. The AG was researching the option to set aside the leased area by executive order to issue an opinion. The subject lease was one of two leases grandfathered by the Legislature as part of subzones only {{for the duration of the}} leases. The AG was also planning to issue an opinion that: 1) lease termination would terminate the subzone, 2) publication of a newspaper notice would be sufficient notification for the removal of a grandfathered subzone due to the termination of mining leases or for any other modifications to subzone boundaries, and 3) for an officially designated subzone, <b>individual</b> <b>notification</b> would be appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Background. Epidemic {{parotitis}} (“mumps”) {{is a human}} {{viral infection}} which affects mainly the salivary glands; its peak incidence afflicts children 5 to 9 -year. At epidemiologic week (EW) 40 / 2010, the Centro Oriente II Level Hospital received a community report about a mumps outbreak in a District Primary School (DPS), eastwards of the locality of Santa Fe (Bogotá). The hospital’s epidemiology office sent a response team to investigate the situation and to guide prevention & control actions. Methods. The team made an outbreak descriptive study; field investigation included description time-place-person; case-definition as patient with active clinical condition of parotitis; Active Institutional Search (AIS) and house visitations; study variables matched those of the official <b>individual</b> <b>notification</b> report. Data were registered and analyzed using Epi -Info 3. 5. 1 ® with frequency, central trend and association measurements. Results. 14 mumps cases were identified: 1 adult and 13 (93 %) children; 5 (35, 7 %) were girls; median age was 11, 9 year (range 7 - 40). Four cases (28, 6 %) were confirmed by clinical signs, 10 (71, 4 %) by epidemiologic link; no one was hospitalized. 12 patients (86 %) had unknown vaccination status; 11 cases (78 %) produced neither the vaccination card nor any additional information. Index case occurred at EW 30 / 2010 and the epidemic peak occurred at EW 34 / 2010; attack rate was 8. 1 %. Conclusions. Epidemiology office confirmed mumps outbreak, delayed notification and impossibility to verify vaccination records. The response team recommended the DPS to strengthen biosafety measures; and advised local health institution to increase epidemiologic surveillance & control activities, adherence to national mumps protocol, school vaccination and to promote information, communication, education strategies on importance of vaccination and cards right use...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that brucellosis in Italy is a food-borne, rather than an occupational disease. This hypothesis was tested using data for both human and animal populations from the period 1997 – 2002. The correlation between the distribution of the disease in the human, sheep and goat populations was analysed, as were the risk factors for the disease, with respect to gender, age, occupation and residence of the <b>individuals</b> involved. <b>Notifications</b> of human brucellosis, which are mandatory in Italy, reach a peak between April and June. However, considering the standard incubation period of 2 – 4 weeks, and the fact that lamb slaughter is traditionally at a peak during the Easter period, it might be expected that occupational exposure would result in a peak of human cases between March and May. The observed peak between April and June could be related to the production and consumption of fresh cheese, starting just after lamb slaughter. The age of patients showed a fairly uniform distribution, and analysis of incidence rates of human brucellosis between 1997 and 2002 showed that the incidence rates were consistent with an occupational exposure risk of about 25 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination of notification systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various types of notifications, and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects of a <b>notification</b> on an <b>individual’s</b> performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the <b>individual’s</b> perception of <b>notifications,</b> and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different types of notifications in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study of notification preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the content of a given notification, can affect that <b>individual’s</b> preferences for <b>notification</b> delivery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper aims to {{highlight}} the importance of aspiring to achieve universal reporting of maternal deaths {{as a part of}} taking responsibility for these avoidable tragedies. The paper first discusses the reasons for reporting maternal deaths, distinguishing between <b>individual</b> case <b>notification</b> and aggregate statistics. This is followed by a summary of the status of reporting at national and international levels, as well as major barriers and facilitators to this process. A new framework is then proposed — the REPORT framework, designed {{to highlight}} six factors essential to universal reporting. Malaysia is used to illustrate the relevance of these factors. Finally, the paper makes a Call to Action by FIGO to promote REPORT and to encourage health professionals to play their part in improving the quality of reporting on all maternal deaths — not just those directly in their care.

Considering this information, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of P. jiroveci carriers (subclinical infections) in Portuguese patients with pulmonary disorders and in healthy individuals. A total of 45 pulmonary specimens were collected from 45 immunocompetent adults with pulmonary disorders, and 37 oral washings from 37 healthy adults, between March 2001 and February 2004. All samples were analysed by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and by amplification of the LSU mtrRNA by nested PCR. The results obtained in this study indicate that: 1) P. jiroveci is frequently detected (24. 4 %) in patients with pulmonary disorders in Portugal; 2) this population might play a role in circulation and transmission of P. jiroveci organisms in the community; 3) patients receiving corticosteroids are more likely to have detectable P. jiroveci in lungs (18 %) than patients who are not receiving this immunosuppressor (12 %); 4) P. jiroveci is infrequently detected in healthy adults. This may be due to very low numbers of latent organisms present in the lungs of healthy adults, difficulty in detecting few organisms, or due to the type of samples used. Screening of these <b>individuals</b> and <b>notification</b> of the results to their physician might be important: for further follow-up and whether or not prophylaxis or treatment should be prescribed; and for the clarification of the epidemiology of P. jiroveci asymptomatic infections.

40|$|A {{continued}} doubling or {{lung cancer}} mortality {{to the end}} of 19 S 6 is reported among 4823 male workers formerly exposed to amosite asbestos, with a marked gradient of increasing risk with increasing level of exposure. Overall, there have been 93 deaths from lung cancer, which is 48 more than the 45 to be expected at national rates. To explore novel means of reducing this risk in the approximately 80 per cent of the workforce still living, both by reducing hopefully some at least of the risk associated synergistically with amosite exposure and smoking as well as that associated directly with cigarette smoking, a feasibility study of <b>individual</b> worker <b>notification</b> has been carried out. A sample of 1001 of the men, those currently living nearest the factory, have been sent information on the lung cancer findings and on anti-smoking advice through their general practitioners. A substantial proportion (78 per cent) of the general practitioners indicated their intention to follow up the anti-smoking suggestions with their smoking patients. Also, a high proportion (62 per cent) of the smokers among the men who replied, indicated their intention to stop or cut down on cigarette smoking, although at 30 per cent the overall response rate was disappointingly low. It is now proposed to extend the notification coverage to all the ex-amosite workers using the methods described, with improvements where possible, and to examine lung cancer trends in future years. It is possible that over 500 lung cancer deaths could be averted in these men...|$|R

A prototype able to deliver synchronized information related with TV content, with intervals of 10, 30 and 60 s, followed by <b>individual</b> or combined <b>notifications</b> (e. g., audio, visual, and haptic—on the tablet and visual—on the TV) was developed.

Quantitative and qualitative results show that receiving notifications while watching TV is effective in alerting users about new information, despite its inherent cognitive disturbance for the TV viewing experience. It was also possible to highlight that in an HCI perspective, the most suitable strategy for integrating notifications (considering type and cadence) should be based on a combination of a visual notification (displayed only on the TV screen) along with a haptic notification (vibration on the tablet); spaced by an interval of at least 30 s...|$|R

To evaluate two algorithms for prioritisation of Xpert in primary health care settings in a high TB and HIV burden setting. Consecutive, presumptive TB patients with a cough of any duration were offered either Xpert or Fluorescence microscopy (FM) test depending on their CXR score or HIV status. In one facility, sputa from patients with an abnormal CXR were tested with Xpert and those with a normal CXR were tested with FM ("CXR algorithm"). CXR was scored automatically using a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) program. In the other facility, patients who were HIV positive were tested using Xpert {{and those who were}} HIV negative were tested with FM ("HIV algorithm"). Of 9482 individuals pre-screened with CXR, Xpert detected TB in 2090 / 6568 (31. 8 %) with an abnormal CXR, and FM was AFB positive in 8 / 2455 (0. 3 %) with a normal CXR. Of 4444 pre-screened with HIV, Xpert detected TB in 508 / 2265 (22. 4 %) HIV positive and FM was AFB positive in 212 / 1920 (11. 0 %) in HIV negative <b>individuals.</b> The <b>notification</b> rate of new bacteriologically confirmed TB increased; from 366 to 620 / 100, 000 /yr and from 145 to 261 / 100, 000 /yr at the CXR and HIV algorithm sites respectively.

The child {{was part of a}} group of 35 families from 16 states and the United Kingdom who traveled from China to the United States with their adopted children. The investigation is ongoing to determine if any of the other adopted children or family members in this group may have developed measles. CDC has also contacted Chinese officials to obtain more information. The 14 month old child with confirmed measles had onset of rash on June 10 th and was likely infectious while traveling from China to the United States on the following flights: China Southern Airlines flight # CZ 327 arriving in Los Angeles (LAX) from Guangzhou, China on June 8, 2004 and Southwest Airlines flight # 1979 from Los Angeles (LAX) to Kansas City, Missouri on June 9, 2004. Due to challenges in obtaining timely and accurate passenger contact information, CDC is providing the flight information in lieu of <b>individual</b> passenger <b>notifications.</b> Although measles transmission is known to occur on commercial aircraft, available data suggest the risk of transmission to other passengers is low. Passengers seated adjacent to a measles infected person appear to have an increased risk of infection. In general, measles is a highly infectious disease that can have severe complications. The incubation period from exposure to rash onset for measles is approximately 10 days (range 7 - 18 days); on rare occasions the incubation period can be as long as 19 - 21 days. Persons on these flights who develop fever and/or rash on or before June 30, 2004 should be evaluated by a healthcare provider for measles. Persons with these symptoms should notify their healthcare provider of the possible exposure to measles before visiting a health care facility so that preparations can be made to avoid exposing other susceptible persons to measles. Possible cases of measles should be reported to state health departments. State health departments are asked to report any possible cases under investigation to CDC (404 - 639 - 8763 or 770 - 488 - 7100).

40|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that the manner of death notification may play an integral role in the grief processes of bereaved individuals and in the meaning they derive from a death; however, no scholars have previously empirically investigated the specific elements of death notification and the possible associations between these elements and sense-making in grief and grief responses. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the current practice-based death notification recommendations with a sample of individuals who were notified of a death loss while attending college. Data were collected from 205 traditional-age (i. e., 18 - 23 years old) undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university and was analyzed using MANOVA, MANCOVA, and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results suggested that the manner of death notification was positively associated with sense-making in grief and was not associated with grief responses; however, the mode of notification (i. e., in-person, telephone, other technology) was not associated with either sense-making in grief or grief responses. Consistent with past research, the results also suggested that the unsettling nature of the death and emotional closeness with the deceased were negatively associated with sense-making in grief and positively associated with grief responses. Furthermore, the results indicated that sense-making in grief and grief responses were negatively associated with each other and that the association between the unsettling nature of the death and grief responses was fully mediated through sense-making in grief. Overall, the results of this study suggested that the current practice-based recommendations for death notification are warranted and that although a number of seemingly static variables (e. g., violence of the death, relationship to the deceased) exist that are likely connected with the grief responses of bereaved <b>individuals,</b> effective death <b>notifications</b> can contribute to bereaved individuals 2 ̆ 7 efforts to make sense of a death loss. ...|$|R
