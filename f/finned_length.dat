40|$|The most {{commonly}} assumed cost for exaggerated male ornamentation is increased predation pressure owing to decreased locomotor performance or increased conspicuousness to predators. Despite its intuitive basis, the locomotor costs of male ornamentation {{are not well}} established. We tested the hypothesis that multiple male signals that are used independently during female choice and male competition could lead to varied locomotor costs. Multiple signals with varied costs could provide a more detailed indicator of overall male quality, as only the highest-quality individuals could support all costs. To test this idea, we investigated the burst locomotor consequences of multiple ornaments for males of the pacific blue-eye (Pseudomugil signifer). We evaluated five competing models relating body size, ornament size and performance traits to field measures of dominance and attractiveness. Non-propulsive male fin ornaments used during male competition were different from those used in female choice.

The <b>lengths</b> of four <b>fins</b> (three dorsal and the caudal) for each fish were measured, and the measurements were made by three different assessors at three different points of time (recording 1 - 3) within six weeks of the experiment. This paper demonstrates the application of digital image analysis for analyzing <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> of cod. In order to provide an indication of the repeatability of digital image analysis, a reliability test was performed. The image of 42 randomly chosen juvenile cod taken at recording 3 was analyzed repeatedly by three different assessors. Significant differences in <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> measurements were found both between and within assessors. However the Pearson’s correlation in <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> measurements between each of the two assessor replicates was equal to or higher than 0. 45. There were moderate correlations of <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> measurements between different assessors (r= 0. 45 - 0. 84), and the correlations between replicates within same assessor were strong (r= 0. 57 - 0. 94).

Generally there were moderate repeatability of the <b>fin</b> <b>lengths</b> analyzed using digital image (R= 0. 46 - 0. 61). With the support of all the statistical results from the reliability test, it is justified to say that this digital image based approach to measure <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> is accurate and feasible for genetic analyses. All the data set obtained from 2100 juvenile cod was used to assess the changes for all four fins during the experiment due to growth or possible erosion. “Relative fin length” expressed as the percentage of <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> to the total body length, was applied in this study to assess the fin erosion.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} part of the BreedWell project, aiming to {{developing}} methods to improve fish welfare in aquaculture breeding programs. The project is run by the Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research (Nofima) and funded by the Research Council of Norway. This study was carried out at Nofima Marin, over the period from December 2011 to August 2012. Animal welfare is a subject of increasing interest for ethical and legal reasons. Various traits can be used as indicators of animal welfare. For selection and breeding purposes, {{it has been shown that}} the trait frequency of injury (e. g. fin damage) can be taken into account in fish selective breeding and have generally been used in cannibalistic fish species such as rainbow trout. However, evidence related to the fin condition of the Atlantic cod is lacking. I believe this study relating to fin morphology and changes in cod will provide useful knowledge for making logical and meaningful inferences of the cause of fin damage due to possible social interactions (or cannibalism) among conspecifics. Changes in <b>fin</b> <b>length,</b> is one of the methods commonly used to assess the degree of fin damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT Traits {{involved}} in reproduction evolve rapidly and show great diversity among closely related species. However, the genetic mechanisms {{that underlie the}} diversification of courtship traits are mostly unknown. Japanese medaka fishes (Oryzias latipes) use anal fins to attract females and to grasp females during courtship; the males have longer anal fins with male-specific ossified papillary processes on the fin rays. However, anal fin morphology varies between populations: the southern populations tend to have longer anal fins and more processes than the northern populations. In the present study, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic architecture underlying the variation {{in the number of}} papillary processes of Japanese medaka fish and compared the QTL with previously identified QTL controlling anal <b>fin</b> <b>length.</b> First, we found that only a few QTL were shared between anal <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> and papillary process number. Second, we found that the numbers of papillary processes on different fin rays often were controlled by different QTL. Finally, we produced another independent cross and found that some QTL were repeatable between the two crosses, whereas others were specific to only one cross. These results suggest that variation in the number of papillary processes is polygenic and controlled by QTL that are distinct from those controlling anal <b>fin</b> <b>length.</b> Thus, different courtship traits in Japanese medaka share a small number of QTL and have the potential for independent evolution...|$|R

This paper described that the heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics of the latent heat recovery type heat exchanger having straight <b>fin</b> (<b>fin</b> <b>length</b> : 65 mm or 100 mm, fin pitch : 2. 5 mm or 4 mm) were clarified by measuring the exchange heat quantity, the pressure loss of heat exchanger, and the heat transfer coefficient between outer fin surface and gas, and that the effects of <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> and <b>fin</b> pitch on heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics were clarified. Furthermore the equations for predicting the heat transfer coefficient and pressure loss which are necessary on design of the heat exchanger were proposed...|$|R

The aims of this study are explore the effects of xenic and axenic rearing conditions on the seabass larvae and check whether the rearing condition has a different ef-fect as larvae grow older. The larvae of seabass larvae, Dicentrarchus labrax L. (Teleostea, Moronidae), were reared under xenic and axenic rearing conditions up to fourteenth day after hatching (DAH). The size and shape were analyses for specimens of three age groups: DAH zero, four and 12. The growth comparison was done based on length measurements. For specimens of DAH zero and four, the total length, gut <b>length,</b> predorsal <b>fin</b> <b>length,</b> yolk sac length and height were measured. For specimens of DAH 12 the total length, standard length, gut <b>length,</b> dorsal <b>fin</b> fold <b>length</b> and height, anal <b>fin</b> fold <b>length</b> and height, preanal <b>fin</b> fold <b>length,</b> predorsal <b>fin</b> fold <b>length,</b> eye diameter, head height, hind gut length and notochord diameter were measured. The average measurements for these metric variables were lower in axenic specimens than xenic ones suggesting better performance in xenic treat-ment. The variations in body shape were studied and quantified using geometric morphometrics. The results showed significant differences in shape between the xenic and axenic specimens at all age groups. Thus, the importance of lar-val rearing conditions in determining seabass shape and quality is evident. Key words/phrases: seabass, aquaculture, body deformity, geometric morphometric...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the pattern}} and {{magnitude}} of sexual dimorphic differences have been investigated in black jaw tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron) (n = 160; 74 males and 86 females) and banded jewelfish (Hemichromis fasciatus) (n = 120; 42 males and 78 females) from the Great Kwa River, Calabar, Nigeria. Fish samples were collected between July and December 2015. Fourteen morphometric variables, including body weight, total length, standard length, body depth, cheek depth, pre-orbital length, postorbital <b>length,</b> pectoral <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> (right and left), pelvic <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> (right and left), head length, gonad weight, eye diameter and four meristic variables, including number of pectoral fins (right and left) and number of pelvic fins (right and left), were taken using standard methods. Size-adjusted morphometric measurements subjected to step-wise discriminant function analysis {{were used to determine}} predictor variables to morphologically differentiate sexes for both species; magnitude of dimorphism between sexes was estimated using percentage classification accuracy of the discriminant function analysis. From the discriminant function analysis, the pectoral <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> and gonad weight positively contributed significantly to morphometric dimorphism (magnitude= 69. 2 %) in male and female S. melanotheron suggesting adaptation for reproductive function; while for H. fasciatus the body depth and standard length were important contributors to sexual dimorphism (magnitude= 84. 2 %) suggesting size dimorphism for aggressiveness, territorial behavior and improving swimming performance. Overall, our results indicate that the different magnitude of sexual dimorphism between the two species could be attributable to the type and functional role of sexual dimorphic traits...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} genetic parameters for direct and social genetic effects (SGE) for growth and welfare traits in farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). A SGE refers to the effect of an individual’s genes on trait performance of its social partners. In total, 2100 individually tagged juveniles from 100 families at an average age of 222 days post-hatching were used. Each family was separated into three groups of seven fish, and were randomly assigned to 100 experimental tanks, together with fish from two other families. Body weight and length of the first, second and third dorsal fin and the caudal fin measured by digital image analysis were measured at the start of the experiment, after two weeks, and after six weeks. Fin erosion was scored subjectively after six weeks. Variance components estimated using a conventional animal model were compared to those of an animal model including a SGE. ResultsHeritabilities from the conventional animal model ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 34 for body weight and 0. 05 to 0. 80 for <b>fin</b> <b>length.</b> Heritabilities for <b>fin</b> erosion were highest for the first dorsal fin (0. 83 [*]±[*] 0. 08, mean[*]±[*]standard error) and lowest for the third dorsal fin (0. 01 [*]±[*] 0. 04). No significant SGE were found for body weight, whereas SGE for <b>fin</b> <b>lengths</b> were significant after two and six weeks. Contributions to the total heritable variance were equal to 21. 5 % (6. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 1) for the direct effect, 33. 1 % (9. 4 [*]±[*] 3. 2) for the direct-social covariance, and 45. 4 % (12. 9 [*]±[*] 4. 1) for the social variance for length of the first dorsal fin. For fin erosion, SGE were only significant for the second and third dorsal fin. ConclusionsIncluding SGE for <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> and <b>fin</b> erosion in the animal model increased the estimated heritable variation. However, estimates of total heritable variances were inaccurate and a larger experiment is needed to accurately quantify total heritable variance. Despite this, our results demonstrate that considering social breeding values for <b>fin</b> <b>length</b> or <b>fin</b> erosion when selecting fish will enable us to improve response to selection for welfare traits in Atlantic cod juveniles...|$|R
