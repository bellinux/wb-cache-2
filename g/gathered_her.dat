5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed, {{and she had no}} kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E

25|$|Slave voyage #1: Thomas Nuttall {{received}} a letter of marque on 17 January 1804. She sailed in February in company with Laurel and Urania. They were out {{only a few days}} when they encountered a French warship. Although they took some casualties, they were able to escape. A database of slave voyages by Liverpool-based vessels shows Kitty Amelia, Nuttall, master, sailing to Cuba, though it does not specify where she <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> human cargo. Kitty's Amelia was back in Liverpool by October, having returned from Havana with a cargo of sugar, cowhides, and cotton.|$|E
25|$|In 1167, Eleanor's third daughter, Matilda, married Henry the Lion of Saxony. Eleanor {{remained}} in England {{with her daughter}} for the year prior to Matilda's departure for Normandy in September. In December, Eleanor <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> movable possessions in England and transported them on several ships to Argentan. Christmas was celebrated at the royal court there, and she appears to have agreed to a separation from Henry. She certainly left for her own city of Poitiers immediately after Christmas. Henry did not stop her; on the contrary, he and his army personally escorted her there before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious Lusignan family. Henry then went about his own business outside Aquitaine, leaving Earl Patrick, his regional military commander, as her protective custodian. When Patrick {{was killed in a}} skirmish, Eleanor, who proceeded to ransom his captured nephew, the young William Marshal, was left in control of her lands.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the Ludlow Massacre, Mary Benich-McCleary, died of a stroke {{at the age of}} 94 on June 28, 2007. She was 18 months old when the massacre occurred. [...] McCleary's parents and her two brothers narrowly escaped death when the conductor of the train that brought the militia to the tent colony stopped the train to shield the family and others trying to flee, but Mary had been left behind. A 16-year-old boy heard her screams, <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> up into his coat and then ran into the woods. Mary and the boy were found several days later, still hiding. McCleary's daughter said family members didn't speak of the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|Slave voyage #2: Nuttall sailed in December {{in company}} with Thomas and Juno. Kitty's Amelia sailed to West Central Africa and St Helena. Having <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> cargo of slaves, Kitty's Amelia sailed for St Barts, {{at the time}} a Swedish colony. (The Swedes did not abolish the slave trade until 1813.) Near Saint Kitts crewmembers {{attempted}} a mutiny, a mutiny that Nuttall foiled. However, three mutineers managed to reach [...] and accused Nuttall of having engaged in transgressions relating to the transportation of slaves. The accusations forced Nuttall to remain in the Caribbean to answer the charges. Kitty's Amelias mate, Thomas Forest, sailed her back to Liverpool from St Barts with a cargo of sugar and cotton.|$|E
2500|$|The Register of Shipping for 1800 {{reported}} that W. Scott was still master of Amelia, {{and that her}} trade was London—Cape of Good Hope. Lloyd's Register for 1800 shows Amelias master changing to Higgins, and her owner to Sims. The 1801 volume confirms the changes and now shows Amelias trade as Liverpool—Africa, something that generally signals a slave trader. Amelia {{does not appear in}} a database of Liverpool-based slave traders, but does appear in the one for London-based ones. The database shows Amelias master as Isaac Higgins, and her owner as [...] John Simms. It does not reveal where she <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> human cargo, but does report that she delivered them to Jamaica. Amelia left Jamaica for London, but then had to put back because she had become leaky.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{evidence}} to the contrary, there are reports, familiar to tourists in Boston, Massachusetts, that the original Mother Goose was a Bostonian wife of an Isaac Goose, either named Elizabeth Foster Goose (1665–1758) or Mary Goose (d. 1690, age 42) who is interred at the Granary Burying Ground on Tremont Street. According to Eleanor Early, a Boston travel and history writer of the 1930s, and 1940s, the original Mother Goose was a real person who lived in Boston in the 1660s. She was reportedly the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six {{children of her own}} to add to Isaac's ten. After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, [...] "Mother Goose" [...] used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, her son-in-law <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> jingles together and printed them.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Iyasu II, his son Iyoas took the throne and rivalry {{exploded}} between {{the mother of the}} late Emperor and his widow. Empress Mentewab had been crowned co-ruler when her then underage son had succeeded her husband. [...] Now that her son was gone, she believed that she was entitled to remain as co-ruler. [...] However, Iyasu's widow, Welete Bersabe (known as Wubit) of the Oromo, strongly believed that it was her turn to take the leading role at the court of her son Iyoas as her mother-in-law had done during the previous reign. [...] The young Emperor took the side of his mother against his grandmother. [...] Empress Mentewab <b>gathered</b> <b>her</b> relatives from her native Qwara and their forces flooded into Gondar to support her claims. [...] When news of the arrival of the Qwaran troops arrived, Welete Bersabe also summoned her relatives from Yejju, and throngs of soldiers arrived from that district to uphold her claims. [...] The city of Gondar was swamped by these two tense armies, and a bloodbath seemed imminent.|$|E
