5|$|Mary strived <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Charles paid no {{attention}} to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E
5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah {{was the only one who}} refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt by}} the two governments to resolve the {{conflict}} in Northern Ireland politically in 1972 through the Sunningdale Agreement failed due to opposition by hard-line factions in Northern Ireland. With no resolution to the conflict in sight, the Irish government established the New Ireland Forum in 1984 to look into solutions. While the British UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the forum's proposals, it informed the British government's opinion and {{it is said to}} have given the Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald a mandate during the negotiation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was directed at resolving the conflict. The 1992 Downing Street Declaration further consolidated the views of the two Governments and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement eventually formed the basis <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province.|$|E

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher.

Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E

25|$|Begin’s most {{significant}} achievement as Prime Minister was {{the signing of}} a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Prize <b>for</b> <b>Peace.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wake of the Camp David Accords, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which was captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin’s government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized {{the bombing of the}} Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies of the Israelis, shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.|$|E
25|$|Though open warfare had abated, {{the revelation}} of Ishgard's bloody origins and the Archbishop's {{complicity}} shocks and splinters the citizenry into populist factions supporting Aymeric and denialists supported by the former clergy who stand to lose their religious influence. Aymeric moves to broach diplomatic relations with Dravania, eager to prove man and dragon can coexist peacefully, dispatching his majordomo Lucia to meet with Vidofnir. Meanwhile, the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud resume their search for the other missing Scions, aided by Krile, a Sharlayan scholar who also possesses {{the power of the}} Echo. Tracing reports of a roguish character, the Scions come across another band of adventurers who identify themselves as the Warriors of Darkness. In a brief altercation, Thancred drives off the false heroes. The party returns to Ishgard in riot—an attempt on Aymeric's life sends the city into chaos. The instigators are discovered to be aligned with the Church orthodoxy, who have taken a number of lowborn hostages and demand a conclave to elect a new Archbishop. The Warrior of Light aids the Temple Knights in a raid on the insurgents' stronghold, climaxing when the ringleader tosses a child off the battlements. By providence, Vidofnir arrives to catch her in midair, having agreed to act as Dravanian ambassador, which plants the seeds of hope <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minds of onlookers.|$|E
