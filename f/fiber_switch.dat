40|$|We {{report a}} novel free-space <b>fiber</b> optic <b>switch</b> {{implemented}} using the surface-micromachining technology. Most of conventional <b>fiber</b> optic <b>switches</b> {{are made in}} waveguide. Free-space approach offers lower coupling loss and smaller cross talk. Currently, these switches are realized by manually assembled bulk elements and are very expensive. Bulk-micromachining of Si substrate {{has been applied to}} free-space optical <b>fiber</b> <b>switches</b> [11. However, monolithic integration is difficult and a substantial assembly is still required. Surface-micromachined micro-optical elements can be optically pre-aligned in the design stage and are monolithically patterned during the microfabrication process. They can be made compact and light weight, and are potentially integrable with the optical sources/detectors and controlling electronics. Therefore, using this approach, the size, weight and cost of current <b>fiber</b> optic <b>switches</b> can be dramatically reduced. The fabrication and characterization of various three-dimensional micro-optical elements have been demonstrated [2] [3]. The schematic diagram of the switch is shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|Background: A {{recent study}} showed that niacin supplementation {{counteracts}} the obesity-induced muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>switching</b> from oxidative type I to glycolytic type II and increases the number of type I fibers in skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats. These effects were likely mediated by the induction of key regulators of fiber transition, PGC-alpha and PGC-beta, leading to muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>switching</b> and up-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid import and oxidation, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether niacin supplementation causes type II to type I muscle and changes the metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscles in growing pigs. Results: 25 male, 11 wk old crossbred pigs (Danzucht x Pietrain) with an average body weight of 32. 8 ± 1. 3 (mean ± SD) kg were randomly allocated to two groups of 12 (control group) and 13 pigs (niacin group) which were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 750 mg niacin/kg diet. After 3 wk, the percentage number of type I fibers in three different muscles (M. longissismus dorsi, M. quadriceps femoris, M. gastrocnemius) was greater in the niacin group and the percentage number of type II fibers was lower in the niacin group than in the control group (P < 0. 05). The mRNA levels of PGC-beta and genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism (CACT, FATP 1, OCTN 2), citrate cycle (SDHA), oxidative phosphorylation (COX 4 / 1, COX 6 A 1), and thermogenesis (UCP 3) in M. longissimus dorsi were greater in the niacin group than in the control group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that niacin supplementation induces type II to type I muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>switching,</b> and thereby an oxidative metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle in pigs. Given that oxidative muscle types tend to develop dark, firm and dry pork in response to intense physical activity and/or high psychological stress levels preslaughter, a niacin-induced change in the muscle´s fiber type distribution may influence meat quality of pigs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a single-mode optical <b>fiber</b> <b>switch</b> which routes individual signals {{into and out}} of a wave-length multiplexed data stream without interrupting the re-maining channels. The switch uses free-space optical wavelength multiplexing and a column of micromechanical tilt-mirrors to switch 16 channels at 200 GHz spacing from 1531 to 1556 nm. The electrostatically actuated tilt mirrors use an 80 V peak-to-peak 300 KHz sinusoidal drive signal to switch between ± 10 with a 20 s response. The total fiber-to-fiber insertion loss for the packaged switch is 5 dB for the passed signals and 8 dB for added and dropped signals, with 0. 2 dB polarization dependence. Switching contrast was 30 dB or more for all 16 channels and all input and output states.

40|$|As {{conventional}} transcriptional {{factors that}} are activated in diverse signaling pathways, nuclear receptors play important roles in many physiological processes that include energy homeostasis. The MED 1 subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex plays a broad role in nuclear receptor-mediated transcription by anchoring the Mediator complex to diverse promoter-bound nuclear receptors. Given the significant role of skeletal muscle, in part through the action of nuclear receptors, in glucose and fatty acid metabolism, we generated skeletal muscle-specific Med 1 knockout mice. Importantly, these mice show enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved glucose tolerance as well as resistance to high-fat diet–induced obesity. Furthermore, the white muscle of these mice exhibits increased mitochondrial density and expression of genes specific to type I and type IIA fibers, indicating a fast-to-slow <b>fiber</b> <b>switch,</b> as well as markedly increased expression of the brown adipose tissue-specific UCP- 1 and Cidea genes {{that are involved in}} respiratory uncoupling.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this contract was to study a novel scheme to obtain very strong third-order optical nonlinearities in fibers doped with a suitable absorber {{in order to produce}} low-power all-optical <b>fiber</b> <b>switches.</b> In these devices, a signal is switched from a first fiber to a second fiber by the application of an optimal pump of wavelength {{different from that of the}} signal. The pump acts on the nonlinearity of the fiber, resulting from the dopant present in the fiber core, to modify the <b>fiber</b> index. The <b>switch</b> is made of a fiber interferometer which transforms this index modulation into an amplitude modulation. The signal is switched as long as the pump is applied, and it returns to the first fiber when the pump is turned off. The incentive was to develop switches exhibiting the following properties: (1) low switching power, (2) a short nonlinear fiber to be able to utilize a short and thus environmentally stable interferometer, (3) fast response time, (4) broad range of signal wavelengths, particularly around 1. 55 and 1. 32 {micro}m, (5) pump wavelengths readily available from diode lasers, and (6) low signal loss. This research also involved the study of various fiber interferometers to determine the best possible switch architectures, in terms of pump power requirement, stability against environmental temperature fluctuations and possible pump-induced heating of the <b>fiber.</b> <b>Switches</b> are strongly needed for a large number of important applications.

40|$|Current <b>fiber</b> <b>switch</b> {{technologies}} use mechanical {{means to}} redirect light beams, resulting in slow switch time, {{as well as}} poor reliability due to moving parts wearing out quickly at high speeds. A non-mechanical ability to switch laser output into one of multiple fibers within a fiber array can provide significant power, weight, and costs savings to an all-fiber system. This invention uses an array of crystals that act as miniature prisms to redirect light as an electric voltage changes the prism s properties. At {{the heart of the}} electro-optic fiber-optic switch is an electro- optic crystal patterned with tiny prisms that can deflect the beam from the input fiber into any one of the receiving fibers arranged in a linear array when a voltage is applied across the crystal. Prism boundaries are defined by a net dipole moment in the crystal lattice that has been poled opposite to the surrounding lattice fabricated using patterned, removable microelectrodes. When a voltage is applied across the crystal, the resulting electric field changes the index of refraction within the prism boundaries relative to the surrounding substrate, causing light to deflect slightly according to Snell s Law. There are several materials that can host the necessary monolithic poled pattern (including, but not limited to, SLT, KTP, LiNbO 3, and Mg:LiNbO 3). Be cause this is a solid-state system without moving parts, it is very fast, and does not wear down easily.

40|$|Twin-core rare-earth doped {{nonlinear}} {{optical fiber}} devices, including optical fiber switches, optical fiber filters and optical fiber amplifiers, are explored in this thesis. An analytical method resorting {{to the energy}} E of an oscillator with perturbed nonlinear potential is proposed and demonstrated for investigating the bifurcation and the near-separatrix-crossing of a nonlinear fiber coupler with loss and saturable nonlinearity. Two characteristic equations for bifurcation and near-separatrix-cros sing are obtained, from which the critical optical power, the minimum coupling length and the maximum coupler length can be decided. These two equations {{can be used as}} the design criteria of a nonlinear fiber coupler with loss and saturable nonlinearity. The techniques of fabrication and measurement of twin-core rare-earth doped nonlinear fibers are described. The nonlinear refractive index coefficients in erbium or neodymium doped fibers are determined using two core fibers in which only one core is doped. The nonlinearity caused by population redistribution in rare-earth doped fibers is wavelength-dependent. Moreover, the nonlinear saturation effect is observed. The all-optical <b>fiber</b> <b>switch</b> constructed from a twin-core erbium-doped fiber is studied theoretically and experimentally. The switching behaviour is simulated theoretically, and a switching fraction of 65 % is obtained experimentally. The advantage of this switch is that it requires only a fraction of a milliwatt of input power to switch. The transient switching experiment indicates that the switching response time is in the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, a compact optical switching device {{through the use of a}} twin-core Nd 3 +-doped fiber coupler and a laser diode is demonstrated. Steady state switching and transient switching is obtained. The switching power is 5. 6 mW and the switching speed is 500 p. s which is 20 times faster than that in twin-core Er^-doped fiber couplers. In addition to the passive fiber devices, an active twin-core rare-earth doped fiber coupler is proposed and studied theoretically. It is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally that a narrow-band wavelength filter/demultiplexer with gain can be constructed from a twin-core rare-earth-doped fiber. The experimental bandwidth obtained is 6. 5 nm. In addition, the filtered signal experiences a gain of 20 dB instead of attenuation. A preliminary study of using light to control light has been carried out. Optical signal switching through the use of a pump light is observed. Finally, a theoretical model has been proposed in that a twin-core erbium-doped fiber can be used as an optical fiber amplifier. Its gain spectrum is flat within 2. 5 dB in a bandwidth of 30 nm. This gain spectrum can be adjusted continuously by varying the pump power launched into one of the cores...|$|E
