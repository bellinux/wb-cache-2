25|$|Serial killer Ivan Milat was {{a client}} of Marsden. Marsden had a long {{association}} with the Milat family and had successfully represented Ivan Milat on charges of rape in the 1970s. Milat sacked Marsden shortly after being arrested in 1994 for the backpacker murders. In 2005, after falling ill with cancer, Marsden indicated his belief that Milat had had an accomplice, and expressed some regrets about his success in helping Milat avoid conviction on the earlier rape charges. He recounted an incident that had happened during trial on those charges: after the first <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> during which Milat appeared likely to be convicted, Marsden - then a closeted homosexual - went to a gay bar and noticed the two alleged victims there. The next <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> he outed them as lesbians and relied on the jury's prejudices to attack their credibility and win acquittal for Milat.|$|E
25|$|Trotsky was not {{defeated}} by bureaucratic decisions or Stalin's {{control of the}} Party apparatus—as his partisans and Trotskyite historians claim. He had his <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> and finally lost because his whole position flew {{in the face of}} Soviet and world realities. He was doomed to defeat because his ideas were incorrect and failed to conform to objective conditions, as well as the needs and interests of the Soviet people.|$|E

As their <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> approaches, the state forces Punky to stay at Fenster Hall, a shelter for orphaned and abandoned children, which makes her realize how close she has grown to Henry. Finally, their day arrives, and the court approves Henry to become Punky's foster father. Later on, Henry legally adopts her.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{atmosphere}} in which the New York City press accused the Soviets of holding Kasenkina against her will, on 11 August New York Supreme Court Justice Samuel Dickstein issued a writ of habeas corpus on Consul-General Lomakin, demanding that he present Kasenkina the following <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> The same day a Soviet consular official stated that Lomakin would not be presenting Kasenkina, and the following morning Ambassador Panyushkin presented the State Department with a note disputing the legalities of the writ under international law. A State Department legal adviser wrote to Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey, outlining the Soviet complaints and urged Justice Dickstein {{to take the case}} under advisement. Shortly afterwards Justice Dickstein reserved decision in the proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Experiences in {{this play}} echo a lawsuit (Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)), to which the playwright Lorraine Hansberry's family was a party when they fought to have their <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> because a {{previous}} class action about racially motivated restrictive covenants (Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519 (1934)) had been similar to their situation. This case was heard prior {{to the passage of}} the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), which prohibited discrimination in housing and created the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Hansberrys won their right to be heard as a matter of due process of law in relation to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the Hansberry defendants were not bound by the Burke decision because the class of defendants in the respective cases had conflicting goals, and thus could not be considered to be the same class.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{the main}} {{feature of the}} reform in December 2002 (Law 45 / 02) was the {{abolition}} of the firm’s obligation to pay interim wages when dismissed workers appealed to labour courts, as long as the firm acknowledged the dismissal to be unfair and deposited the highest severance pay (45 <b>days)</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> two <b>days</b> before the dismissal. Although, in principle, is arguable whether this reform meant a reduction in F, there is evidence that, in order to avoid lengthy court procedures, most employers ended up paying much higher firing costs than the statutory ones under “fair” dismissals (Bentolila et al. 2012). Thus, in contrast to the two previous reforms, we interpret this reform as one where F increased.|$|R
