The company also has introduced additional detailed checks, {{to be carried}} out in the event of subsequent engine or ECU replacement. Airbus said these checks were necessary to [...] "avoid potential risks in any future flights," [...] and added that the alert had resulted from its internal analysis and was issued as [...] "part of the continued airworthiness activities, independently from the ongoing official investigation into the accident." ...|$|E
