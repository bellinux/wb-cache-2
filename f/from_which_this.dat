5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second originates above {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short and rounded. The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>this</b> species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines.

25|$|British {{diplomats in}} Italy had {{for some time}} been advocating British {{intervention}} in Corsica, and had sent previous approaches to Paoli which had so far been ignored. By the summer of 1793 however a large British fleet {{had arrived in the}} region with orders to blockade the ports of southern France. The particular focus of this operation was the large French fleet base at Toulon, and the British fleet, under Admiral Lord Hood needed a forward base with a sheltered anchorage <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>this</b> operation could be organized; Corsica seemed the ideal location. Hood however was immediately distracted by a Royalist uprising in Toulon. Having expelled the Republican leaders of the city the Royalists offered it to Hood, who entered the port, seized the French fleet and occupied the town in August. The Republican forces then laid siege to the city, and Hood had few forces to spare to assist Paoli.|$|E

500|$|Nepenthes × kinabaluensis {{is another}} {{impressive}} plant. The pitchers get large also, {{but do not}} compare to those of N. rajah or N. × alisaputrana. It is a well-known natural hybrid of what many {{consider to be the}} two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo: N. rajah and N. villosa. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species are occur sympatrically. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies {{on the west side of}} the Upper Kolopis River. The only accessible location <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>this</b> hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about 2900m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030m. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. [...] These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid's parentage (N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs). The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1–2cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. [...] In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World (Cheers, 1992).|$|E

Left to their own devices, the Kakhetian nobles rallied behind David Jandieri and revolted against Isa Khan on September 15, 1615. The rebellion quickly spread to Kartli, and the Georgian nobles proposed Teimuraz I as king of all of eastern Georgia. A punitive Iranian expedition under the command of Ali Quli-Khan was routed by Teimuraz’s forces at Tsitsamuri, leading Shah Abbas to personally lead the next invasion in 1616.

It is worth noting that the first page of the book has a seal that reads [...] "Biblioteca Seminario Menor de Monterrey Donativo del Sr. Emmo. Adolfo Antonio Cardenal Suárez Rivera", ("Library of the Minor Seminary of Monterrey Donated by Sr. Eminentísimo Adolfo Cardinal Suárez Rivera"), for many years Cardinal Archbishop of the Diocese of Monterrey. This Spanish edition of Michelini's writings where supposedly Christ himself defends Valtorta's Work, comes with a copy of two letters between Bishops. The first letter is from the Bishop of León, México Anselmo Zarza Bernal and is addressed to Bishop Miguel García Franco at the time Bishop of Mazatlán. The response to Bishop Zarza is the second letter. In the first letter, Bishop Zarza recommends to Bishop García Franco the reading and reflection of Michelini's book, in response Bishop García wrote: [...] "I received your letter...that came with the book" [...] (Michelini's Book) [...] "...I find all the doctrine contained in the book 100% orthodox, more yet, in whole coincident with the writings of Mrs. Conchita Cabrera de Armida...".|$|E
2500|$|The Proto-Indo-European root <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>this</b> noun {{is derived}} is *steh₂- (older {{reconstruction}} *stā-) [...] "to stand" [...] (or [...] "to stand up, to step (somewhere), to position (oneself)"), {{which is also}} the source of English to stand, Latin , and Ancient Greek [...] (...) , all meaning [...] "to stand" [...] and Russian [...] (stan, meaning [...] "settlement" [...] or [...] "semi-permanent camp"). English state originates from the same root, through Old French estat, from Latin status ("manner of standing, attitude, position, carriage, manner, dress, apparel; and other senses"), from stare. In Polish, Belarusian and Ukrainian, [...] means [...] "state" [...] or [...] "condition", while in Serbo-Croatian it translates as [...] "apartment" [...] (a Slovenian word [...] "stanovanje" [...] means apartment or other closed space of living is an obvious derivative of stan) in its modern usage, while its original meaning was [...] "habitat". In Czech and Slovak, it means [...] "tent" [...] or, in military terms, [...] "headquarters". Also in Germanic languages, the root can be found in Stand ("place, location"), and in Stadt (German), stad/sted (Dutch/Scandinavian), stêd (West Frisian) and stead (English), all meaning either [...] "place" [...] or [...] "city".

2500|$|The next {{revival in}} shanties {{occurred}} {{as part of}} the Anglophone folk music revival of the mid-20th century. The American folk revival group The Almanac Singers were recruited by Alan Lomax to record several shanties for the 1941 album Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads. In Britain, the incorporation of shanties into the folk revival repertoire was largely led by A.L. Lloyd starting in the 1950s. An amateur folklorist, Lloyd discarded the earlier classical style of presentations in favor of a more [...] "authentic" [...] performance style. He was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements; he obviously referred to collections by editors like Sharp, Colcord, and Doerflinger, however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention. Lloyd's album The Singing Sailor (1955) with Ewan MacColl was an early milestone, which made an impression on Stan Hugill when he was preparing his 1961 collection, particularly as the performance style it embodied was considered more appropriate than that of earlier commercial recordings. Many other performers followed, creating influential versions and interpretations of shanties that persist today. For example, Lloyd's personal interpretation of [...] "South Australia" [...] was taken up by the Irish folk revival group The Clancy Brothers, <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>this</b> version spread to countless folk performers to become established as the [...] "standard" [...] form of what is usually presented as a [...] "traditional" [...] shanty. Through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs, the Folk Revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunes—a sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing. Another effect, {{due to the fact that}} most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres, is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of [...] "folk song," [...] and their distinctive use, manner of performance, and identity were co-opted.|$|E
