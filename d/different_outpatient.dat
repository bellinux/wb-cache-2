This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the validity of an immunochromatographic assay, ICT Tuberculosis test for the serologic diagnosis of TB in Antalya, Turkey. Methods Sera from 72 patients with active pulmonary (53 smear-positive and 19 smear-negative cases) and eight extrapulmonary (6 smear-positive and 2 smear-negative cases) TB, and 54 controls from <b>different</b> <b>outpatient</b> clinics with similar demographic characteristics as patients were tested by ICT Tuberculosis test. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of the ICT Tuberculosis test for pulmonary TB were 33. 3 %, 100 %, and 52. 9 %, respectively. Smear-positive pulmonary TB patients showed a higher positivity rate for antibodies than smear-negative patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. Of the eight patients with extrapulmonary TB, antibody was detected in four patients. Conclusion Our results suggest that ICT Tuberculosis test can be used to aid TB diagnosis in smear-positive patients until the culture results are available. </p...|$|E

Methods: Cross-sectional survey assessing schizophrenic patients and their caregivers who consulted for the fi rst time in four <b>different</b> <b>outpatient</b> psychiatric departments. Results: One hundred and four schizophrenic patients were selected: 56. 7 % began the HCSB with traditional medicine; 22. 1 % with western medicine, psychiatry included, and 20. 2 % with religious medicine; 77. 3 % did not begin the HCSB with psychiatry because they did not know it was a mental problem or because they did not know mental health services existed. The patients ’ education was the only factor that signifi cantly infl uenced the HCSB. Conclusion: In Cambodia, traditional and religious medicine are the fi rst pathway to mental healthcare when patient and caregiver decide to seek help due to psychotic symptoms. The lack of knowledge on mental health and facilities appears the main reason to explain the schizophrenic patients ’ HCSB.

The incidences of technique failure and any com-plication within 90 days were 10 % and 38 % respectively. The occurrence of complications was not statistically sig-nificantly <b>different</b> for <b>outpatients</b> and electively admitted patients. Average costs for catheter insertion were higher in electively hospitalized patients than in outpatients (€ 2320 ± € 960 vs € 1346 ± € 208, p < 0. 000). ♦ Conclusions: Compared with an inpatient procedure, outpatient insertion of a PD catheter results in similar outcomes at a lower cost.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the collaboration of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Regenstrief Institute {{to develop a}} computerized adverse drug event (ADE) monitor using electronic medical records from outpatient practices. We describe the steps involved in ADE monitor development and rule validation at large outpatient practices at Boston and Indianapolis. The final standard rule set adopted by both practice sites are currently being {{used to test the}} impact of basic and advanced decision support on ADE rates. The rules used by the ADE monitor derive from coded medication names and laboratory results, as well as text from clinician notes contained within the electronic medical record systems. The nontext rules are subdivided into five categories: medication, laboratory, medication-laboratory, ICD- 9 codes, or miscellaneous. Rules target various diagnostic and laboratory abnormalities caused by a broad range of outpatient medications commonly used in primary care. Text-based rules were developed for certain medications by linking the medications with symptoms (ADE) that are often associated with short- or longterm. The rules were run on 4 months of data at both sites, possible ADEs were identified and validated by chart review, and the positive predictive values of each rule were calculated. We found that clinically based rule sets can be developed and implemented at <b>different</b> <b>outpatient</b> settings using distinct information systems to identify ADEs related to commonly prescribed outpatient medications...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} two {{patients}} with cases of intermittent claudication (IC) from the vascular surgery clinics of the Ottawa General and Ottawa Civic Hospitals along with 99 control patients from <b>different</b> <b>outpatient</b> clinics of these Hospitals were recruited. For each subject {{information about the}} background, medical history, and lifestyle were collected by a face to face interview, using a questionnaire. A number of blood tests, and clinical examinations were also done to complete {{the information about the}} exposure, outcome, and the potential risk factors. Serum copper status was obtained through atomic absorption spectrophotometry and PAOD status was assessed by means of Doppler ultrasound. The variable smoking group was shown to be an effect modifier in this data and therefore, the odds ratios for different strata of smoking group were calculated. The association of serum copper and PAOD was statistically significant in ex-smokers with an odds ratio of 2. 38 (95 % CI: 1. 10, 5. 15) for a five unit increase of serum copper. In conclusion, smoking and systolic blood pressure were strongly associated with PAOD. The association of serum copper and PAOD, after adjusting for the variable smoking group, systolic blood pressure, and all other study confounders, was reduced to a non-significant level. However, after considering the variable smoking group as an effect modifier, a statistically significant association between serum copper and PAOD was demonstrated in ex-smokers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) was examined using a third-generation ELISA in 3, 350 serum samples obtained from patients visiting <b>different</b> <b>outpatient</b> clinics, preoperative patients, and women visiting for ante-natal {{care at the}} Dr. Fakeeh hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from January to September 1998. The population included mainly Saudis, Egyptians, and Yemenis, and patients from other Middle East and Asian countries. The prevalence of HCV infection was 5. 87 % among Saudis, 22. 54 % among Egyptians, and 2. 12 % among Yemenis. The prevalence among patients from other Middle East and Asian countries were 3. 38 % and 4. 98 %, respectively. The overall prevalence among the studied group was 6. 75 %. Genotyping of isolates from Saudi Arabia showed that the prevalences of types 4, 1 a, 1 b, and 2 were 45. 9 %, 40. 6 %, 10. 85 %, and 2. 7 %, respectively. Genotyping of isolates from Egypt showed that type 4 was the major type among Egyptians (91. 6 %), while types 1 a and 1 b each had prevalences of 4. 2 %. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered the major cause of parenteral and sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide. 1, 2 The widespread use of serologic tests in screening blood donors and at risk populations has identified many subjects infected with this virus, with prevalences varying from coun...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low-risk {{patients}} with community-acquired pneumonia are often hospitalized despite guideline recommendations for outpatient treatment. Methods: Using {{data from a}} randomized trial conducted in 32 emergency departments, we performed a propensity-adjusted analysis to compare 30 -day mortality rates, time to the return to work and to usual activities, and patient satisfaction with care between 944 outpatients and 549 inpatients in pneumonia severity index risk classes I to III {{who did not have}} evidence of arterial oxygen desaturation, or medical or psychosocial contraindications to outpatient treatment. Results: After adjusting for quintile of propensity score for outpatient treatment, which elimi-nated all significant differences for baseline characteristics, outpatients were more likely to return to work (odds ratio [OR], 2. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 5 to 2. 6) or, for nonworkers, to usual activities (OR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 1. 8) than were inpatients. Satisfaction with the site-of-treatment decision (OR, 1. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 7 to 1. 8), with emergency department care (OR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 0. 9 to 1. 9), and with overall medical care (OR, 1. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 8 to 1. 6) was not <b>different</b> between <b>outpatients</b> and inpatients. The overall mortality rate was higher for inpatients than outpatients (2. 6 % vs 0. 1 %, respectively; p < 0. 01); the mortality rate was not differen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough endovenous laser {{ablation}} for varicose veins is replacing surgical stripping, proper economic evaluation with adequate follow-up in a randomised clinical trial {{is important for}} considered policy decisions regarding the implementation of new techniques. MethodsData from a randomised controlled trial comparing cryostripping and endovenous {{laser ablation}} in 120 patients were combined to study Short Form (SF) 6 D outcome, costs and cost-effectiveness 2 years after treatment. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 2 years after treatment was calculated using different strategies, and uncertainty was assessed with bootstrapping. ResultsOver the total study period, mean SF- 6 D scores improved slightly from 0. 78 at baseline to 0. 80 at 2 years for patients who underwent cryostripping and from 0. 77 to 0. 79 for patients who underwent endovenous laser. QALY (SF- 6 D) was 1. 59 in patients who underwent cryostripping and 1. 60 in patients who underwent endovenous laser 2 years after treatment. The costs of cryostripping and endovenous laser per patient were € 2651 and € 2783, respectively. Bootstrapping indicated that cryostripping was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 32 per QALY gained. With regard to <b>different</b> strategies, <b>outpatient</b> cryostripping was less costly and more effective 2 years after treatment. ConclusionIn this study, in terms of costs per QALY gained, outpatient cryostripping {{appeared to be the}} dominant strategy, but endovenous laser yielded comparable outcomes for a relatively little additional cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the acceptance of structured diagnostic interviews in clinical practice, as well as research, settings. Using the Diagnostisches Interview bei Psychischen Störungen (the modified and extended German version of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV), 10 certified interviewers conducted 183 structured interviews in <b>different</b> inpatient, <b>outpatient,</b> and research settings in Switzerland and Germany. After each interview, patients and interviewers filled out a questionnaire asking for their evaluation of the interview. Patients' and interviewers' reactions to the interview were highly positive. On a scale measuring overall satisfaction with the interview (0 =not at all satisfied, 100 =totally satisfied) the mean patient rating was 86. 55 (SD= 13. 18), and the mean interviewer rating was 85. 82 (SD= 12. 84). The procedure used by the interviewer was rated by 142 (78. 5 %) patients as being helpful, and 176 (96. 7 %) rated the relationship as being positive. Less than 16 % of the interviews were described as exhausting by the patients and interviewers. A majority of the interviewers (92. 6 %) indicated that during the interview they could respond adequately to the patient. The results of this study indicate that structured diagnostic interviews are highly accepted by interviewers and patients in a variety of settings. These findings, together with the existing evidence of the reliability and validity of structured interviews, should encourage their use in the diagnostic process, in outpatient and inpatient clinical settings as well as in research studies...|$|R
