For all <b>households,</b> the <b>combined</b> elasticity estimate for yam was above unity and almost as high as that of meat. For high expenditure households, however, it was significantly below unity but still positive. The estimate for any cassava product was below unity but positive for all <b>households</b> <b>combined.</b> For high expenditure households, especially urban households, the estimate for all cassava products combined was negative, but that for gari, a high-quality processed cassava product, although still below unity, was positive and higher than tlie estimate for yam. The estimates suggest that market potentials exist for increased production of root and tuber crops in the area. The estimates also suggest that although in certain forms of preparation cassava may be an inferior food item, in other forms, it is far from being inferior; it may even be superior to yam. This suggests that there is need for improvement in cassava-processing technology to improve quality and expand the market for that root crop.

30|$|Livelihood {{diversification}} is {{the process}} by which <b>households</b> <b>combine</b> diverse portfolios of activities and assets in order to improve their welfare (Ellis 2000; Scoones 1998). Little et al. (2006) have defined livelihood diversification among pastoralists as ‘the pursuit of any non-pastoral income earning activity, whether in rural or urban areas’. Several reasons have been advanced to suggest why diversification takes place. According to Ellis (2000) and Barrett et al. (2001), the two reasons for diversification are necessity and choice. Poor households succumb to push factors that make them diversify out of necessity so as to survive, while wealthier households take advantage of the pull factors that present them with opportunities of creating wealth. Von Broun and Pandya-Lorch (1991) see diversification as ex ante risk minimization and ex post coping strategy. Diversification can have both positive and negative outcomes, depending on factors that make a household to diversify.|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and compare magnitude of class inequalities in women's health detected with four occupation-based class measures: individual, conventional household (male dominant), gender neutral <b>household,</b> and <b>combined</b> <b>household.</b> DESIGN: Cross sectional study, using health {{data obtained by}} physical examination, laboratory analysis, and self report. SETTING: A large pre-paid health maintenance organisation in Oakland, CA (US). PARTICIPANTS: 686 women (90 % white) enrolled in Examination II of the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study (1989 - 1990). MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of women categorised as "working class" equalled 45, 30, and 21 per cent, respectively, for the individual level, gender neutral household, and conventional household class measures. Class inequalities in health, comparing women categorised as working class with non-working class, generally were stronger using the gender neutral household class measure, compared with the conventional household or individual class measure; {{in the case of}} "fair or poor" health, the respective odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (adjusted for age and marital status) were 1. 9 (1. 1, 3. 4), 1. 5 (0. 9, 2. 5), and 1. 3 (0. 8, 2. 2), while for high post-load glucose levels, they were 1. 7 (1. 1, 2. 6), 1. 2 (0. 8, 1. 7), and 1. 3 (0. 9, 1. 8). The <b>combined</b> <b>household</b> class measure yielded effect estimates comparable to those of the gender neutral household class measure but with less precision, because of smaller strata.

Kurt apologizes, but asks Burt to learn about homosexual relationships so if Kurt has questions, he can ask Burt like a boy would normally ask his father. As it turns out, Kurt is quite ignorant about sexual matters and refuses to educate himself; this so alarms Blaine that he asks Burt to consider broaching the subject with Kurt, citing safety concerns. Burt subsequently gives Kurt [...] "the talk" [...] about sex.
