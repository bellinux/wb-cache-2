METHODS PVC model-PVC pipe {{was used to}} create a gap model mimicking vertebral endplate orientation and disk space width of large-breed canine cervical vertebrae; 6 models had a 4 -mm gap with no spacer (PVC group 1); 6 had a PVC pipe ring spacer filling the gap (PCV group 2). Animals-large breed cadaveric canine cervical vertebral columns (C 2 -C 7) from skeletally mature dogs without (cadaveric group 1, n[*]=[*] 6, historical data) and with an intervertebral disk spacer (cadaveric group 2, n[*]=[*] 6) were used. All PVC models and cadaver specimens were instrumented with monocortical titanium screws/PMMA. Stiffness of the 2 PVC groups was compared in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using non-destructive 4 -point bend testing. Stiffness testing in all 3 directions was performed of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion unit in cadaveric spines and repeated after placement of an intervertebral cortical allograft ring and instrumentation.

40|$|Cervical spines {{show the}} largest {{mobility}} in whole human spine, and therefore, aging process exerts various influences on these parts. Among them, degeneration of the intervertebral disk may cause neurological damages following disk herniation or intervertebral instability. Recently {{the patients who}} undergo cervical reconstruction surgery have been increasing in number. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze stress distribution of the intervertebral substitute in cervical reconstruction surgery utilizing several methods of stress analysis. The model used is polyurethane prototypes imitating C 5 and C 6 human cervical spine and <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacer</b> made of epoxy resin. Vertical compression force was applied on the model in an electric furnace in which temperature was precisely controlled in order to preserve photoelastic fringe patterns in the epoxy resin spacer. The stress distribution was analyzed under five different loading directions. As a result, posterior one third part of the spacer got larger stress when the direction of compression load was precisely vertical. The stress distribution showed bipolarization by changing the load direction whether forward or backward. On the other hand, the data from pressure films varied widely, and therefore, this method was not competent to analyze the stress in this experiment. Though the data from strain gauge showed similar values to those from photoelastic method, it involved one inconsistent value. In conclusion, photoelastic method was considered to be most consistent and valuable for stress analysis of cervical intervertebral substitute...|$|E

40|$|<b>Intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> for {{anterior}} spine fusion {{are made}} of different materials, such as titanium, carbon or cobalt-chrome, which can affect the post-fusion MRI scans. Implant-related susceptibility artifacts can decrease the quality of MRI scans, thwarting proper evaluation. This cadaver study aimed to demonstrate the extent that implant-related MRI artifacting affects the post-fusion evaluation of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers.</b> In a cadaveric porcine spine, we evaluated the post-implantation MRI scans of three <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> that differed in shape, material, surface qualities and implantation technique. A spacer made of human cortical bone {{was used as a}} control. The median sagittal MRI slice was divided into 12 regions of interest (ROI). No significant differences were found on 15 different MRI sequences read independently by an interobserver-validated team of specialists (P> 0. 05). Artifact-affected image quality was rated on a score of 0 - 1 - 2. A maximum score of 24 points (100 %) was possible. Turbo spin echo sequences produced the best scores for all spacers and the control. Only the control achieved a score of 100 %. The carbon, titanium and cobalt-chrome spacers scored 83. 3, 62. 5 and 50 %, respectively. Our scoring system allowed us to create an implant-related ranking of MRI scan quality in reference to the control that was independent of artifact dimensions. The carbon spacer had the lowest percentage of susceptibility artifacts. Even with turbo spin echo sequences, the susceptibility artifacts produced by the metallic spacers showed a high degree of variability. Despite optimum sequencing, implant design and material are relevant factors in MRI artifacting...|$|R
40|$|Study Design : Retrospective study. Objective: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} and radiological results of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using titanium <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> in elderly patients over 70 years. Summary of Background Data : PLIF with <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> {{has been introduced}} to treat degenerative lumbar disorders. However, in the elderly patients, it is concerned that there are several possible complications that {{can be associated with}} the use of interbody support in anterior column reconstruction under weak bone quality. There were few reports about the results of PLIF using titanium <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> in elderly patients. M ethods : Twenty-six patients with mean age of 73 years(range, 70 - 78) underwent one or two-level PLIF using titanium intervertebral blocks combined with posterior instrumentation,with minimum 2 -year follow-up (average 49 months; range, 25 - 88). Radiographic and clinical outcomes analysis was performed. Results : The sagittal alignment (regional lordosis) of the operative segments averaged 7. 4 °before surgery, 12. 7 °at discharge, 11. 1 °post-op 1 -year, and 11. 8 °at the final follow-up. The percentage of posterior disc height was 14. 1 ％ before surgery,and was significantly improved after the surgery to 26. 9 ％ at discharge and 21. 8 ％ at the final follow-up. In 18 patients with spondylolisthesis, the percentage of slip averaged 18. 9 ％ before surgery, and was significantly improved after the surgery to 6. 8 ％ at discharge and maintained until the final follow-up. All patients had radiographic fusion at the follow-up. The average JOA score was 12. 6 points before surgery,and increased significantly to 23. 1 points at the final follow-up. Conclusion : Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using titanium spacers is valuable even in the elderly patients. The preservation of bony endplate of vertebral body, and the insertion of spacers as antero-lateraly as possible in the intervertebral space, are important for successful fusion...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{recently}} attracts {{many applications}} in orthopaedics such as <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacer,</b> spinal cage and prosthesis. However, literatures suggest {{this material is}} bio-inert in nature. Its inferior bioactivity may lead to poor bone-implant interaction. Some researchers incorporated hydroxyapatite or tri-calcium phosphate in PEEK to enhance its bioactivity. Mechanical properties such as elasticity and fatigue may, however, alter as material micro-structure has been changed. To avoid it, surface modification is therefore an alternative. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of bioactivity enhancement of PEEK using an advance surface technique named plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). PEEK discs were polished and undertaken PIII treatment with plasma sources such as water, ammonia and strontium at 15 kV at 50 Hz for 2 hours. Afterwards, surface morphology, roughness, elemental chemical profile, chemical bonding and hydrophilicity were examined by SEM, AFM, XPS, FT-IR, and contact angle measurement respectively. Bioactivity was evaluated by simulated body fluid immersion test at day 21 and cytotoxicity was assessed by MC 3 T 3 E 1 cell culturing at day 2 and 5. The surface roughness slightly decreases after water and ammonium PIII, whereas it increases after strontium PIII. The surface contact angle of the treated samples reduces, but surface energy increases. Literatures suggested these changes favour cell attachment and proliferation. In our cell culture experiment, cells have attached more on the treated surfaces. All these results preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of PIII treatment to enhance bioactivity of PEEK.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the biomechanical behaviour {{of a novel}} distraction-stabilization system, consisting of an intervertebral distraction bolt, polyaxial screws and connecting rods, in the canine lumbosacral spine. Study design: Biomechanical study. Sample population: Cadaveric canine lumbosacral spines (L 4 -Cd 3) (N= 8) Methods: Cadaveric lumbosacral spines were harvested, stripped of musculature, mounted on a 4 -point bending jig, and tested in extension, flexion and lateral bending using non-destructive compressive axial loads (0 - 150 N). Angular displacement was recorded from reflective optical trackers rigidly secured to L 6, L 7 and S 1. Data for primary and coupled motion were collected from intact spines; after destabilization at L 7 -S 1, and following surgical stabilisation with the new implant system. Results: As compared with the intact spine, laminectomy resulted in a modest increase in angular displacement at L 6 -L 7 and a marked increase at L 7 -S 1. Instrumentation significantly reduced motion at the operated level (L 7 -S 1) with a concomitant increase at the adjacent level (L 6 -L 7). Conclusion: The combination of a polyaxial pedicle screw-rod system and <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacer</b> provides a versatile solution of surgical stabilisation of the lumbosacral joint following surgical decompression in the canine lumbosacral spine. The increase in motion at L 6 -L 7 may suggest the potential for adjacent level effects and clinical trials should be designed to address this question.

40|$|Introduction: Subsidence {{is not the}} {{consequence}} of a single loading event. More specifically, subsidence may be interpreted as the continuous sinking due to continuous loading. As such, a single static load may not be appropriate. Few studies involving cage subsidence have employed continuous cyclic loading. The goal {{of this study was}} to address the mechanical subsidence performance via prediction of the final subsidence depth and the rate of subsidence. It is hypothesized that those spacer designs, which engage the stronger vertebral body periphery, enable endplate stress distribution through increased contact area, and reduced stress concentrations would display more favorable performance characteristics with respect to subsidence. Materials and Methods: Three <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacer</b> designs were evaluated; threaded titanium, endplate-sparing titanium, and Polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Devices were randomly but equally assigned to porcine L 4 and L 5 vertebral bodies with endplates prepared as per recommended surgical procedure. Specimens were loaded from – 50 N to – 350 N at 1 Hz for 600 cycles with continuous load versus deformation acquired at cycle 10 and at 25 cycle intervals thereafter. For each cycle interval, the net deformation between the maximum and minimal applied load (or subsidence) was computed. The deformation for all six samples of each design were averaged across each cycle interval and subjected to a nonlinear exponential analysis. More specifically, the subsidence is represented by the independent variable Y. Initial subsidence is calculated at the 10 th loading cycle and was represented by the variable Y 0. From the subsidence versus cycle data, the rate of subsidence (K) was determined as well as the plateau, or asymptotic limit, of the subsidence. All parameters were compared using a one way ANOVA with a Tukey posthoc test for determination of statistical difference (α 3 ̆c 0. 05) between designs. Results and Discussion: All implants displayed an exponential relationship with respect to the number of applied cycles. Significant differences among all three designs were determined for initial subsidence Y 0 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and subsidence limit (plateau) (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). For both parameters, the endplate-sparing titanium device displayed the least subsidence when compared with the other designs. The subsidence rate K displayed a statistically reduced rate for the endplate-sparing titanium device when compared with the threaded or PEEK designs. (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Clinically, such a condition results in a slow and gradual settling of the titanium implant upon the endplate surface. The PEEK implant displayed a more rapid and greater subsidence than either the endplate-sparing or threaded titanium designs. Conclusions: Under continuous loading, an endplate-sparing titanium device displayed significantly reduced initial and final subsidence and subsidence rate when compared with threaded and PEEK designs. The clinical implication of these results is that implant material modulus is not the sole determinant for subsidence.

30|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a {{semicrystalline}} linear polycyclic aromatic thermoplastic polymer first synthesized in 1978 [6]. PEEK {{is commonly}} used as a material for <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> and bone screws [7, 8]. Due to its special chemical structure, PEEK has high resistance to chemical and physical changes [6, 9, 10]; also, it is resistant to wear and is stable under high temperatures [6]. In addition, PEEK biocompatibility was proven both in vitro and in vivo {{and it does not}} cause any toxic or mutagenic effects [11 – 13]. Its big advantage is elasticity similar to that of a human bone, which allows balanced weight distribution between an implant and a bone; therefore, there is no stress shielding effect after implantation. However, PEEK exhibits hydrophobic and bioinert properties, which are not favorable for protein adsorption and cell adhesion [14, 15]. Thus, in order to improve these properties, the PEEK surface needs to be modified.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: According to {{anterior}} spine fusion <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spacers</b> made of titanium or cobalt-chromium al-loys are {{of special}} interest. With regard to postoperative problems implant related artifacts {{can lead to}} a decreased MRI evaluation. The focus {{of this study was to}} compare the respective implant artifact artifact range dependend on different MRI sequences. To simplify artifact evaluation we introduced in this study a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. Material and Methods: We performed an MRI artifact evaluation of 2 different metallic <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spacers</b> (cobalt-chromium and titanium alloy). A carcass porcine spine was employed. Considering 12 defined spinal regions of interest we evaluated the respective implant artifact properties independent from the total artifact volume by using a new developed 0 - 1 - 2 score. The artifact range was documented for 15 different MRI-sequences. Results: For the titanium spacer as well as the cobalt-chromium-spacer an MRI evaluation of the implant/disc space situation could not be carried out. In contrast to the cobalt chromium spacer the titanium spacer allowed a good differentiation of the spinal canal opposite to the implant. Optimal MRI imaging results for both metallic <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spacers</b> could be achieved considering TSE sequences. Conclusion: A comparison of these two metallic spacers showed in all examined sequences clear advantages in favour of the titanium spacer. The best MRI representation of both tested implants by reducing implant related artifacts could be achieved with fast spin echo (TSE-) sequences. In spite of the use of TSE sequences a variability of susceptibility artifacts has to be included with regard to implant shape and material. With regard to the results of this study the easy use of a new developed artifact score represented a useful help to compare implant related MRI artifact properties independent from the actual implant related total artifact volume...|$|R
40|$|Aim: <b>Intervertebral</b> <b>spacers</b> for {{anterior}} spine fusion {{are made}} of different materials, which can affect the post-fusion MRI scans. Suscep- tibility artifacts specially for implants made of titanium alloys can decrease the image quality. This study focused {{on the influence of}} deter-mined implant parameters like shape and implant volume in MRI artifacting independent from se-lected MRI-sequences. Methods: In this study the post-implantation MRI scans of determined cuboids and cylinders were evaluated. All in-terbody test implants were made of titanium alloys. MRI scans were carried out by using T 1 TSE sequences. The total artifact volume (TAV) of all examined implants were calculated for sta-tistical t-test correlation and implant volume (IV) /TAV-relation. Results: Considering all ex-amined test implants with an increasing implant size the TAV became significant larger (p< 0, 001) with simultaneous reduction of the respective IV/TAV-relation. According to an intergroup TAV- correlation for cylinders and cuboids with an equivalent implant volume the cylindric test im-plants demonstrated a significant smaller arti-fact range (p< 0, 05). Conclusions: Based on these results the MRI artifacts of larger test im-plants were more limited to the to the implant’s direct surroundings. In this connection for im- plants with identical material volumes a cylin- dric shape demonstrated more advantages con- sidering MRI artifacting than cubic forms...|$|R
40|$|Biomechanical {{evaluation}} of a biodegradable cage for interbody fusion at the cervical spine Biomechanical {{evaluation of}} a biodegradable cage for interbody fusion in the cervical spine. A in vivo animal study in a sheep model.   Abstract Background Anterior interbody fusion using an <b>intervertebral</b> <b>spacer</b> is a widely accepted surgical treatment for patients with degenerative and traumatic cervical spinal-column injuries. However the established methods are still associated {{with a number of}} unsolved problems. Thus iliac crest bone grafting, regarded as the gold standard method, is correlated with a high rate of donor site   morbidity and pseudarthrosis. The frequently used metallic cages can cause artefacts in   imaging procedures which hamper assessment; moreover, the long-term side-effects of metallic cages are still unknown. The use of biodegradable cages could solve these problems. Due to complete degradation long-term-side effects would be avoided, postoperative removal of material would be unnecessary and radiological assessment could be carried out undisturbed. Objectives The purpose of   this study is to evaluate the biomechanical segmental stability of a ventral spondylodesis provided by a biodegradable 70 / 30 PL-DL-LA interbody fusion cage in comparison with a tricortical iliac crest bone graft spondylodesis. Methods 45 adult female sheep, race Merino, underwent a C 3 /C 4 discectomy and ventral spondylodesis   with ventral plate-stabilization. A 70 / 30 Poly-(L, DL) -Lactid-Cage (Groups II, IV und V: n= 9), implanted following Robinson&# 8217;s technique, served as the interbody coupler and in the control groups respectively a tricortical iliac crest bone graft (Groups I und III: n= 4). The groups stabilized by cages were euthanized after 3 (Group II), 9 (Group IV) und 24 months (Group V), and the animals of the iliac crest bone graft groups after 3 (Group I) and 9 months (Group III). Immediately after euthanasia the biomechanical stability of the cervical spine devices was tested in a non-destructive, unconstrained three-dimensional manner: in axial rotation right and left, lateral bending right and left, flexion and extension. Results No significant increase of the stiffness over time could be determined for the cage-groups. The elastic zone for axial rotation to the right and lateral bending to the left significantly decreased between 3 and 24 month post-operative testing. The iliac crest bone graft groups on the other hand showed a significant increase of stiffness in all directions and a significant decrease of the range of motion, the neutral zone and the elastic zone in all directions. The comparison of the two methods showed a significantly lower stiffness of the cage groups than the iliac crest bone graft groups: in flexion at the 3 month post-operative testing, in axial rotation to the right and to the left at the 9 month testing and in extension and flexion when the 24 month-results of the cage-spondylodesis were compared with the 9 month results of the iliac crest bone spondylodesis. A significantly higher ROM (Range of motion) and EZ (elastic zone) was found for flexion 3 month postoperative in the cage group. 9 month postoperative the NZ (neutral zone) for all directions but Flexion and the ROM for rotation right and left were significant higher in the cage group. The NZ of all directions as well as   the ROM and EZ of the flexion and extension were significant higher in the cage group when the 24 month results of the cage-spondylodesis were compared with the 9 month results of the iliac crest bone group. Conclusions Already 3 months after the operation the stabilizing qualities of the new biodegradable cage were significantly worse than that of the iliac crest bone graft. The lack of stability increases with time and the long-term&# 8211;results affirm that a bony fusion is not ensured. Clearly a high early mechanical instability is correlated with a high risk of non fusion of the spinal segments and with bad long-term bio-mechanical outcomes. The results of this first in vivo study of the new biodegradable cage made out of 70 / 30 PLDLLA lead {{to the conclusion that the}} cage is not bio-mechanically equal to the iliac crest bone graft, so that the tricortical iliac crest bone graft, even if it is correlated with disadvantages, remains the gold standard for ventral interbody spondylodesis. </html...|$|E

This paper {{describes}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system for modelling and digital fabrication of discrete and functionally graded multi-material objects for biomedical applications. The MMVP system {{consists of a}} DMMVP module, an FGMVP module, and a virtual reality (VR) simulation module. The DMMVP module is used to model discrete multi-material (DMM) objects, while the FGMVP module is for functionally graded multi-material (FGM) objects. The VR simulation module integrates these two modules to perform digital fabrication of multi-material objects, which can be subsequently visualized and analyzed in a virtual environment to optimize MMLM processes for fabrication of product prototypes. Using the MMVP system, two biomedical objects, including a DMM human spine and an FGM <b>intervertebral</b> disc <b>spacer</b> are modelled and digitally fabricated for visualization and analysis in a VR environment.
