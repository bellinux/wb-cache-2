She wrote,Love proves itself by deeds, so <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> to show my love? Great deeds are forbidden me. The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love.|$|E
500|$|Their debut EP, <b>How</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?, Recorded by Lee Boylan and {{released}} by Irish indie label FIFA Records in early 2007, sold out and generated {{a significant amount}} of interest in the media and in the Irish blogging community in the process. In May 2007, Fight Like Apes won Phantom FM's Topman Unsigned Band Search; their prize was to be a support act of The Holloways at show in Dublin. Fight Like Apes played both Electric Picnic (their first major Irish festival) and Hard Working Class Heroes in 2007 and also performed at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. They were also chosen to play the Futureshock stage at EXIT in Serbia after sending a demo of their songs to the organisers. On 13 October 2007, Fight Like Apes performed [...] "Jake Summers" [...] on television chat show, Tubridy Tonight.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "how dry I am" [...] {{had become}} {{structured}} into song and referred specifically to drinking alcohol {{by at least}} 1898, as one journal describes a college drinking song that goes: <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> God only knows How dry I am.A 1919 book entitled Out and about: A Note-book of London in War-time describes a group of Americans drinking in London and singing [...] "some excellent numbers of American marching-songs," [...] including one described as [...] "the anthem of the 'dry' States" [...] whose lyrics were:Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> You don't know <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> am.Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> And nobody cares a damn.The 1921 musical comedy Up In The Clouds included a similar song entitled [...] "How Dry I Am" [...] with music by Tom A.

500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E
500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? <b>How</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to get through this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, they {{discover}} {{the identity of}} one of the dead robbers, Blake, and learn of his abandoned apartment. Fauxlivia goes to the apartment alone without alerting Peter, but Peter soon joins her. The two find that Blake had a roommate, likely the third man, but he is nowhere to be seen. That night, while at Olivia's apartment, Fauxlivia studies Olivia's case files, and comments of her prime counterpart, [...] "You have a photographic memory. <b>How</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> gonna do that?" [...] indicating that she does not possess this ability. A moment later she is visited by the third man, Joe (Russell Harvard), who had seen Fauxlivia at Blake's apartment and, believing her to be a cop, brought the item stolen from the Milton home - a small box. Fauxlivia finds Joe is deaf, and thus was unaffected by the ultrasonics of the box. Fauxlivia contacts Newton, who collects the box [...] having originally hired the men to collect it for him [...] and offers to kill the deaf man. Fauxlivia tells him she will take care of things herself and shoots the deaf man. While hiding the body, Peter arrives to talk to her. To distract him and prevent him from noticing a pool of blood seeping under the bathroom door, Fauxlivia engages in romantic actions with Peter.|$|E
2500|$|The Taliban rulings {{regarding}} public conduct placed severe {{restrictions on}} a woman's {{freedom of movement}} and created difficulties for {{those who could not}} afford a burqa or didn't have any mahram. These women faced virtual house arrest.

2500|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} great review, saying [...] "I mean. <b>How</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> {{supposed}} to discuss Once's two-hour finale -- an epic, fantastical take on Back to the Future complete with far-off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, and a princess in disguise -- when all I can talk about, all I can think about, is that final shot, which may just be the most surprising {{moment in the history}} of OUAT?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I nodded {{comprehension}} of his statement, and acquiescence in it, {{as a man}} should nod who knows all about men. But secretly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> perplexed.

And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to guess that the story of how the Queen had thrown him down on his own boat, the moment I hove in sight, was already the gleeful gossip of the water-front? And by the same token, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to guess that her brother Pat's offishness with me was anything else than temperamental gloominess of spirit? ...|$|R

I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] I remember seeing the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. I thought they were so little and so amazing. I thought, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to stay this little?

2500|$|Gaye {{had also}} been deeply {{affected}} by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", in 1969, which became a UK hit for Gaye in 1970. Gaye cited the 1965 Watts riots as a pivotal moment in his life in which he asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> supposed to keep singing love songs?"

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> supposed to keep singing love songs?"

2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to get by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at [...] midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E
2500|$|The man of {{business}} and fortune ... is up and in the city by eight, swallows his breakfast in haste, attends a meeting of creditors, must read Lloyd's lists, consult the price of consols, study the markets, look into his accounts, pay his workmen, and superintend his clerks: he has hardly a minute {{in the day to}} himself, and perhaps in the four-and-twenty hours does not do a single thing that he would do if he could help it. Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what I like to do?
