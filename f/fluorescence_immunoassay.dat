40|$|Three {{procedures}} (radioimmunoassay, <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay,</b> and enzyme immunoassay) for {{the determination}} of gentamicin and tobramycin levels were compared. These systems were evaluated {{on the basis of}} accuracy, reproducibility, specificity, and cost. All three systems showed a high degree of accuracy and precision. The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> gave significantly lower values for gentamicin and tobramycin at levels below 5 microgram/ml. Of the three systems, the radioimmunoassay was the least expensive, provided that a minimum of 10 analyses were performed daily; single tests required more technical time and were more costly. Costs of single tests by <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> and enzyme immunoassay systems were similar.

In the standard <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay,</b> 10 (8) colony-forming units of A. viscosus reacted with an antibody preparation, were washed, and then were treated with an excess of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. After another set of washes, fluorescence was determined in a spectofluorometer; in most cases excitation was at 485 nm, with emission measured at 525 nm. These conditions minimized interference from light scatter and stray light. Under appropriate conditions, antibodies to A. viscosus could be readily determined, with the fluorescence of the specific antibody-treated cells {{more than five times}} the fluorescence of controls treated with normal rabbit serum. Organisms coated with specific antibody could be detected at levels approaching 10 (5) colony-forming units per ml. The standard <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> procedure was readily adapted to the measurement of either particulate or soluble surface antigens of A. viscosus by competition of the antigen with a fixed amount of antibody in the standard assay system; the competition resulted in an antigen dose-dependent inhibition of fluorescence.

The vancomycin assay is a homogeneous competitive inhibition immunoassay based on changes in fluorescence polarization that occur with antibody binding. This assay was compared with a liquid chromatographic assay and an agar well diffusion bioassay method by using clinical serum specimens and controls. Linear regression {{analysis of the data}} obtained on clinical specimens by the three methods resulted in correlation coefficients of 0. 97 for the <b>fluorescence</b> polarization <b>immunoassay</b> versus the liquid chromatographic assay (n = 60), 0. 90 for the <b>fluorescence</b> polarization <b>immunoassay</b> versus the bioassay (n = 57), and 0. 90 for the liquid chromatographic assay versus the bioassay (n = 57). Repetitive analysis of control sera containing 7, 35, and 75 micrograms of vancomycin per ml by the <b>fluorescence</b> polarization <b>immunoassay</b> yielded coefficients of variation of 3. 0, 1. 7, and 2. 3, respectively.

40|$|We {{compared}} the {{precision and accuracy}} of five methods {{used to measure the}} concentration of vancomycin in serum: bioassay, high-pressure liquid chromatography, fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA [TDX; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill. ]), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay.</b> Based on an analysis of seven standards and of 106 patient samples, all five methods were accurate, and four (bioassay, high-pressure liquid chromatography, FPIA, and RIA) were also precise. The FPIA was the most precise and the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> was the least precise of the methods tested; intrarun coefficients of variation for these two methods were 0. 9 to 3. 0 % versus 8. 9 to 14. 5 %, and interrun coefficients of variation were 2. 8 to 8. 1 % versus 12. 2 to 16. 2 %, respectively. The RIA was inconvenient because it required an extra dilution of the specimen being tested and an additional (64 micrograms/ml) vancomycin standard for specimens with 32 to 64 micrograms of vancomycin per ml.

40|$|A {{solid-phase}} sandwich <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> using nanocrystals of a fluorogenic precursor, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), conjugated with monoclonal antibodies for {{the detection}} of C-reactive protein (CRP), is described. FDA nanocrystals were coated with distearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE), modified with amino(poly(ethylene glycol)) (PEG(2000) -Amine) as an interface for coupling biomolecules. CRP was chosen as a model analyte because of its widely accepted role as a marker for acute inflammation and prospective heart failure. A low limit of detection (1. 10 mu g l(- 1)) and high precision (CV = 2. 72 - 9. 48 %) were achieved. Following the immunoreaction, the monoclonal anti-CRP conjugated nanocrystals were released by hydrolysis and dissolution instigated by the addition of a large volume of organic solvent-sodium hydroxide mixture. Using human serum samples from 66 patients with high heart attack risk and 19 healthy blood donors, this CRP <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> showed a good correlation to the commercially available, turbidimetric immunoassay for CRP.

In this study, we show that amphiphilic polymers such as alkylated poly(ethylene imine) s and 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatoethanolamine-N-[amino(poly(ethyle ne glycol)) ] can fully substitute the more intricate layer-by-layer technique and evaluate the influence of surface charge and particle size on the overall performance of these assays...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation {{of human}} low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{was found to}} be accompanied by the generation of various reactive aldehydes. One of them, 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE), was shown to modify LDL to a form which represents a good model of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). In order to investigate the epitopes newly formed on HNE-modified LDL, a polyvalent antiserum to HNE-LDL [anti-(HNE-LDL) ] was raised in rabbits and the non-specific components were removed with native LDL coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4 B. Competitive <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> analysis showed that anti-(HNE-LDL) recognized HNE-LDL, copper-oxidized LDL, HNE-albumin and to a lower extent HNE-modified high-density lipoprotein 3 (HNE-HDL 3) and ox-HDL 3 but not native LDL. A certain degree of cross-reactivity of the antibody with LDLs modified by either hexanal or 2, 4 -heptadienal was found. No reaction was obtained with LDL labelled with malondialdehyde. From the abilities of HNE-modified poly(L-amino acids) to compete with HNE-LDL for binding to anti-(HNE-LDL), it is postulated that lysine, tyrosine, arginine and histidine are involved in the formation of HNE-derived epitopes on apolipoprotein B (apo B). Using a double-sandwich <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> [capture antibody: anti-(apo B); detection antibody: anti-(HNE-LDL) ] we found that the HNE-derived epitopes were expressed at a far higher degree in ox-LDL and HNE-LDL than in native LDL...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} {{of the major}} active component of cannabis, Delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), becomes increasingly relevant due to its widespread abuse. For control purposes, some easy-to-use, sensitive and inexpensive test methods are needed. We have developed a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> utilising THC-fluorescein conjugate as tracer. Fluorescence spectroscopy of the conjugate revealed an unusual property: The relatively weak fluorescence of a dilute tracer solution was increased {{by a factor of}} up to 5 after binding of a THC-specific antibody. Fluorescence lifetime measurements in aqueous solutions suggested two different tracer conformations both associated with quenching of fluorescein fluorescence by the intramolecular THC moiety. After antibody binding, the tracer enters a third conformation in which fluorescence quenching of fluorescein is completely suppressed. Utilising this property, we established a homogeneous competitive immunoassay (homogeneous increasing <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay)</b> with low detection limits. The test requires only two reagents, the new tracer molecule and an anti-THC antibody. A single test takes only 8 min. The dynamic detection range for THC is 0. 5 to 20 ng/mL in buffer, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 5 ng/mL. The test also works in diluted saliva samples (1 : 10 dilution with buffer) with an LOD of 2 ng/mL and a dynamic range of 2 - 50 ng/mL...|$|E
40|$|Sol-gel-derived {{mesoporous}} biomaterials {{were used}} {{for the first time in}} the flow-injection <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> system. Anti-gentamicin antibody was immobilized in a mesoporous sol-gel material using tetramethoxysilane as a precursor and poly(ethylene glycol) as a template. The sol-gel glass was used to develop an immumoaffinity column for the flow-injection immunoassay of gentamicin. Little unspecific adsorption of gentamicin on the sol-gel and no antibody leaching under harsh elution conditions were found. The immunoassay is based on the competition between gentamicin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled gentamicin for a limited number of encapsulated antibody binding sites. NaOH solution of 5 x 10 (- 3) mol/L is used for the regeneration of encapsulated antibody binding sites after each measurement, which allows the immunoreactor to be used for up to 20 times without any loss of reactivity. Sample preconcentration is not needed and a single assay can be performed within 10 min. The calibration for gentamicin has a working range of 250 - 5000 ng/mL with a detection limit of 200 ng/mL, which is close to that of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>immunoassay</b> and fluorescence polarization immunoassay using the same reactants.
