Since the latter represent all sorts of inefficiencies, this practice blurs the measurement of technology. Input requirements are better measured by minimal proportions between inputs and outputs.

This study compares the survey-based regional <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> and production multipliers published by Statistics Finland, 2000, with estimates obtained by applying location quotients (LQs) to national data. The consequences of using alternative adjustment formulae, the 'SLQ, CILQ and FLQ' are illustrated by an input-output model constructed for the Keski-Pohjanmaa (K-P) region. The results indicate that the SLQ and CILQ both produce highly misleading regional <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> and multipliers. These adjustment formulae are clearly not good enough for the purposes of making local policy and regional planning. The FLQ formula (β= 1) yields much better regional <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> and multipliers than the SLQ and CILQ. The FLQ gives very good estimates for regional multipliers in nearly all industries. The difference between the multipliers generated by the FLQ and the survey-based K-P regional multipliers is on average about - 0 · 3 %. The multipliers for the K-P region are typically much lower than for Finland as a whole, indicating that the economic structure of the K-P region is dependent on that of other regions. Hence {{there is a need to}} make proper allowance for interregional trade. In the case of the K-P region, the FLQ with β= 1 was able to offset the tendency of the CILQ to generate excessively large regional multipliers.

40|$|The {{fast and}} steady {{economic}} growth in China during the 1990 s has attracted much international attention. Using the three most recent Chinese input-output tables, this paper investigates industry structure and inter-industry relationships {{and the relationship of}} both to economic growth. The input-output tables contain intermediate demand and final demand for six broad industries, namely, Agriculture, Industry, Construction, Transportation, Post and Telecommunications, Services, and Other, for 1992, 1995 and 1997, which enables computing of <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> for three time periods. As direct and indirect <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> characterise industry structure during a particular time period, changes over time reflect the patterns in industry structure evolvement. Furthermore, output growth in a particular industry can be analysed from two different sources, namely the changes in <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> that reflect technological change, and the change in final demand. This paper sheds light on four different issues over the five-year period from 1992 to 1997 : (1) Was growth driven by technological changes or final demand increases? (2) As a result of the interdependence of industries, how did an increase in final demand in one industry affect growth in another? (3) How has the bottleneck of an insufficient capability in the Transportation, Post and Telecommunications sector to cope with demands from other sectors been affected during this period? (4) Has the industry structure of the economy been shifting in conformity with traditional growth theory, namely with a decline in the agricultural sector and a rise in the modern industrial sector?...|$|R

An example of uncertainty {{due to lack}} of knowledge on processes involved is the use of different approaches for estimating fertilizer use efficiency in two land use optimization studies. A further problem is uncertainty {{due to lack of}} data; this is illustrated with an example from the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Very few data are available to determine fertilizer use efficiency and data from regions with similar soil and climate type are not available. Data from non-similar regions may not give a correct assessment of the possibilities in the region. Different concepts and sources of information result in different estimates of coefficients, which might in turn greatly influence the results of the linear programming model.

While {{there has been a}} great deal of experimentation focused on the accuracy of alternative methods for estimating regional <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients,</b> little attention has been directed to the role of accuracy when the input-output system is nested within a broader accounting framework. The issues of accuracy were considered in two contexts, forecasting and impact analysis focusing on a model developed for the Chicago Region. We experimented with three input-output data sources: observed regional data, national input-output, and randomly generated <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The effects of different sources of input-output data on regional econometric input-output model revealed that there are significant differences in results obtained in impact analyses. However, the adjustment processes inherent in the econometric input-output system seem to mute the initial differences in input- output data when the model is used for forecasting. Since applications of these types of models involve both impact and forecasting exercises, there would still seem to be a strong motivation for basing the system on the most accurate set of input-output accounts.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{construction of}} input-output models measuring {{the economic impact}} of a farming innovation organisation (The Birchip Cropping Group) on the Victorian regional economy of Buloke Shire. The input-output modeling undertaken is of two forms; the first being a simple na&iuml;ve top-down model, and the second a more sophisticated hybrid model. The na&iuml;ve top-down model is based on <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> drawn from the Australian national input-output tables, and is regarded as na&iuml;ve because these <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> are not adjusted to take account of local economic factors. The hybrid model uses the same national <b>input-output</b> <b>coefficients</b> as a base, and then modifies these coefficients to better reflect industrial conditions in the Shire using a location quotients-adjustment technique, as well as using original survey data collected from entities operating in B uloke Shire. One of the aims of the thesis is to determine whether the simpler na&iuml;ve top-down approach produces results consistent with the theoretically more accurate hybrid methodology, and thus whether the na&iuml;ve top-down approach represents a reliable method of conducting regional economic impact analysis. That is, can such studies be undertaken accurately using a na&iuml;ve top down approach, or is it necessary to adopt the more resource intensive methodology of a hybrid model. The results of the analysis suggest construction of a hybrid model is advisable, as generally the na&iuml;ve top-down approach produces over-estimates of the economic effects of the Birchip Cropping Group. That is, it appears the economic impact multipliers estimated with the na&iuml;ve top-down model are too large, suggesting the time and effort involved in constructing the hybrid model was worthwhile. Using the hybrid model, the conclusion is that the Birchip Cropping Group has a significant affect on the regional economy of Buloke Shire, with the economic impact being estimated at close to $ 600, 000 in additional output, $ 61, 000 in additional income, and 3. 5 additional jobs per year...|$|R
