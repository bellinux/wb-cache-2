40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new potentially low-cost massively parallel electron lithography system, which we term as RadioIsotope-powered Parallel Electron Lithography (RIPEL). We demonstrate its applications to solar cells, thermo-opto-mechanical excitation, inertial sensors, micro-speakers, ultrasonic mechanical DNA sensors. RIPEL utilizes the spontaneously emitted high-energy electrons from beta-emitting radioisotope thin films to parallel expose <b>electron</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist</b> on the wafer, through a nano-stenciled mask that {{is placed in}} proximity to the wafer. This approach enables massively parallel e-beam lithography, with the possibility to expose very large areas concurrently {{as the source of}} electrons can be made very large. This method potentially eliminates the need for vacuum systems and the electron focusing column as needed in the existing electron beam lithography systems because the electrons emitted are not focused and are emitted close enough to the substrate. This technology will greatly simplify the overall electron lithographic system and reduce the cost of deep-sub nanometer lithography. RIPEL has been demonstrated to show promising applications to various fields, including solar energy harvesting, photonic crystal based NEMS and inertial sensors. Ordered nanostructure arrays, with large-area controllable spacing, orientation and size, are promising for high-efficiency solar cells, due to the strongly enhanced light trapping, high carrier collection efficiency and potential low cost. Available top-down lithography approaches to fabricate large-area ordered nanostructure arrays are challenging due to the requirement of both high resolution and high throughput. We have used RIPEL to fabricate ordered silicon nano-conical-frustum array structures, leading to high-efficiency (up to 10. 8 %) thin-film (5 [mu]m thick) solar cells. Furthermore, these photonic crystal nano-structure arrays have been integrated onto a thin membrane, enabling highefficiency opto-thermo-mechanical remote excitation for MEMS systems. The membrane structure has been used for an optically excited micro-speaker and optically transduced mass sensor. The same structure demonstrates an ultra-low threshold for chaotic motion due to a very large air-damping, which is due to the large effective surface area. RIPEL has also been used to fabricate inertial sensors, which show small device variations due to the high manufacturing precision of RIPEL system...|$|E
40|$|Hierarchical nanopatterned {{interfaces}} are {{an intriguing}} tool to study clustering processes of proteins like for example integrins that mediate cell adhesion. The {{aim of this}} work {{is the development of}} innovative methods for the fabrication of hierarchical micro-nanopatterned surfaces and the use of such systems as platforms to study cell adhesion. In {{the first part of this}} work different approaches are presented which are suitable for preparing micro-nanopatterned interfaces at a large scale and high sample throughput as required for biological studies. Nanopatterning is achieved by employing diblock copolymer lithography, a method previously reported to be suitable for the fabrication of extended arrays of noble metal nanoparticles by pure selfassembly. The particles are thereby embedded in a micellar shell built up by the polymer, which can be transferred to solid interfaces. Within this work the method has been combined with conventional lithographic techniques to control the particle orientation on discrete areas on the substrate material with single particle precision. Electron beam lithography was used to immobilize gold particles by cross-linking the polymeric matrix with a focused electron beam. The benefits of high precision, single particle deposition and arbitrary pattern design of this technique are opposed by the lack of ability to cover areas larger than a square millimeter in one day exposure time. To overcome this drawback, nanopatterned silicon chips were completely coated with an <b>electron</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist</b> that covered all particles on the substrate. After illuminating the resist by electron beam lithography in desired areas, the unexposed parts including the underlying particles could be removed. Washing off the protecting resist in exposed parts revealed the gold particles pattern. With this technique exposed areas could be increased to square centimeter areas within one day exposure time. As a further approach a new method was developed by exposing the substrate through a metal grid to electrons emitted by an electron flood gun rather than scanning the substrate by a focused beam. Micropatterned areas of several square centimeters could be prepared within minutes, even on non-conductive glass substrates. The three different approaches now provide a toolbox out of which a method can be chosen that suits the respective scientific purpose. Possibilities range from single particle deposition to larger scale arbitrary patterns, that can even be transferred to non-conductive and transparent substrates. The second part of the work, the cellular interactions of rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF) and dendritic cells (DC) with the biofunctionalized micro - nanopatterns produced were studied. Biofunctionalization included linkage of a cell receptor addressing peptide to the nano-particles and a protein repellent layer in between to avoid unspecific interaction. Fluorescent and electron microscopy images revealed, that cellular anchor points are confined to the underlying micro-nanopattern of gold particles. Intracellular actin networks connect to these protein anchor points, forming so called focal adhesions, and thereby mediate mechanical stress. At sizes of the squared adhesive patches of larger than or equal to 1 µm actin fibers connected to one adhesive patch. Whereas, if patterns consisted of squared patches smaller than or equal to 500 nm side length the actin fibers bridged these pattern gaps over several adhesion domains. Patterns with edge lengths of 100 nm comprising 6 ± 1 particles per patch were found to be the minimum number of adhesion receptors that need to cluster in order to induce adhesion. Cell-surface interactions have also been studied with dendritic cells, that play a key role in the immune system since they capture antigens in peripheral tissues and migrate to lymph nodes to present the processed antigen to T-cells and trigger an immune response. In contrast to fibroblasts, DCs were also able to adhere to gold particles that were functionalized with a control peptide that does not address integrins and to particles that were not functionalized at all. Additionally DC adhesion could be induced even on homogeneous patterns with spacings of up to 130 nm. Dendritic anchor points were confined to squared adhesive patches if the pattern comprised edge lengths of 5 µm or 10 µm, but were able to bridge pattern gaps if hierarchical structures consisted of 1 µm and 500 nm adhesive areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} shrinking of {{the feature}} size forces {{scientists and engineers}} to develop new lithographic techniques and suitable materials which can {{meet the requirements of}} the market. Despite its low throughput, EBL remains the number one candidate when writing very small structures. Achieving ultimate resolution with EBL requires not only a very good lithographic tool (with small probe size) but also a highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>electron</b> beam <b>resist</b> which is able to undergo the lithographic process {{and at the same time}} yields a very high resolution. Most of the exposures are performed with a SEM and the use of smaller probe sizes (eg, in STEM) is quite limited due to the delicate handling of the thin samples which have to be used in this case. Nowadays, in EBL, as will be demonstrated in this thesis, sub- 10 nm features can be obtained using different types of organic and inorganic resists. In order to test the ultimate resolution of this lithographic technique, dense features should be written for which the distance between two adjacent features is equal to the feature size measured after the development process. We might say that fabricating ultrahigh resolution structures using resist based EBL is like a chain reaction which starts with the spin coating of the resists and ends with the development process and inspection session. The goal of this thesis is to understand and explain the phenomena that take place in ultrathin resist layers to be able to optimize the process for generating dense sub 20 -nm features. The understanding of the electron scattering that takes place, both in the resist and in the substrate, is a crucial factor when choosing the material for nanolithography. Because the interaction of the beam with the sample is a very complex process, a Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to calculate the bond breaking distributions for different resist materials. By varying one parameter at a time (e. g. resist thickness, resist material, acceleration voltage), the resolution can be predicted from the bond breaking distributions. Ultra-high resolution has been obtained with ultrathin Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist layers. For this specific resist, the most important factors which limit the resolution are being discussed throughout the chapters of this thesis. Charged Particle Optics GroupApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} electron-beam <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist</b> CSAR 62 is investigated in its negative-tone regime. The writing temperatures span a wide range from 4 K to room temperature with {{the focus on the}} liquid helium temperature regime. The importance of low temperature studies is motivated by the application of CSAR 62 for deterministic nanophotonic device processing by means of in-situ electron-beam lithography. At low temperature, CSAR 62 exhibits a high contrast of 10. 5 and a resolution of 49 nm. The etch stability is almost temperature independent and it is found that CSAR 62 does not suffer from peeling which limits the low temperature application of the standard electron-beam resist PMMA. As such, CSAR 62 is a very promising negative-tone resist for in-situ electron-beam lithography of high quality nanostructures at low temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{fabrication}} of microstructure using deep x-ray lithography (DXRL) is the irradiation of a x-ray <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist</b> like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) by hard x-rays. At the Advanced Photon Source, a dedicated beamline allows the proper exposure of very thick (several mm) resists. To fabricate electroformed metal microstructure with heights of several mm, a PMMA sheet is glued onto a metallic plating base. An important requirement is that the PMMA layer must adhere well to the plating base. The adhesion is greatly reduced by the penetration of even a small fraction of hard x-rays through the mask absorber into the substrate. In this work we will show a novel technique to improve the adhesion of PMMA onto high-Z substrates for DXRL. Results of the improved adhesion are shown for different exposure/substrate conditions...|$|R

Thermogravimetrical investigations indicate the loss of nitrogen being the initial thermal decomposition step and exhibit sufficient stabilities for the requirements for laser ablation application. Fourier transform infra-red, nuclear magnetic resonance, and gas chromatography analyses showed the successful synthesis of triazene.

40|$|Until now, nanotopography {{has been}} {{considered}} in 2 D construct designs. This has been due to fabrication limitations with traditional lithographic processes relying {{on the ability to}} focus radiation that will expose a radiation <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist</b> (e. g. photolithography and electron beam lithography). More recently, alternative methods that offer rapid and cheap nanofabrication have been developed; such methods include polymer demixing and colloidal lithography. Polymer demixing in 2 D has relied on spin casting of polymer blends-such as polystyrene and polybromostyrene in a solvent such as toluene. As the solvent evaporates, the polymers phase separate and form nanoislands. In this study, the polymer blend solution has been blown through fine tubes and allowed to demix, thus providing 3 D constructs for cell biology. The ability to fabricate in tubes may be useful in many applications, for example stents, conduits, and bone repair (when considering structures such as Haversian tubes and Volkmann's canals). As proof of concept, human osteoprogenitor cells have been used to test the cell response to the nanopatterned tubes.

In this technique, the Ta absorber layer is deposited and patterned {{on the back}} side of the membrane and nonspin-coated <b>electron</b> <b>sensitive</b> layers were used in order to achieve high resolution patterning of this absorber. The advantages gained by this approach include a reduction of the membrane temperature during the plasma etching step of the absorber patterns without using any cooling gas. This temperature reduction results from the direct contact of the membrane with a cooling plate. This approach also allows increased protection of the absorber patterns from contamination during exposure of the mask. A third advantage is that the smooth surface of the mask exposed to the wafer in the x-ray lithography stepper may also make it possible to reduce the gap between wafer and mask, thus achieving increased resolution with the x-ray lithography process...|$|R

40|$|Atom {{lithography}} {{was invented}} {{in the last decade}} at Bell Labs, where the possibility of producing nanostructures with laser manipulated neutral Na atoms was demonstrated for the first time [1]. Atom lithography [2] is in principle similar to optical lithography, the main difference being that the roles of light and matter are reversed each other. While in optical lithography matter (material masks) is used to pattern a light beam (which is then used to impress the photoresist), in atom lithography nanopatterns are produced through interaction of a neutral atom beam with a “light mask”, a suitable configuration of stationary e. m. fields quasi-resonant with an atom transition. Such interaction leads to space segregation of the beam into regular arrays of atoms, which can be used either for direct deposition or to impress a particle <b>sensitive</b> <b>resist.</b> The process keeps the advantageous possibility of large-area patterning typical of conventional lithography, while using a virtually defect-free mask able to produce regular nanopatterns with interferometric precision.

With e-beam lithography the requirements on resolution and flexibility can be fulfilled but the writing time becomes the bottle neck. Acceleration by Variable Shaped Beam (VSB) writing principle (geometrical primitives with flexible size can be exposed {{with a single}} shot) is sometimes not sufficient. Character Projection (CP) is able {{to speed up the}} writing drastically because complex pattern of a limited area can be exposed by one shot [1].

The process steps as sputtering, lithographical printing, electrochemical metal deposition (ECD), and selective etching are highlighted in detail. Two kinds of a plating base are used for various electrodeposits. They also act as an under-bump metallization (UBM).
