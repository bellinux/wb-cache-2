5|$|Arthur Harris was {{appointed}} Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command on 22 February 1942, and immediately set about implementing {{his plan to}} destroy Germany through dehousing. As part of their move to area attacks, {{on the night of}} 28 March a force dropped <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> incendiaries on Lübeck, causing massive damage. Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders were enraged, and ordered retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the model}} assumes {{homogeneous}} mixture, {{the theory is}} well applicable to study the explosive behavior of solid fuels (spontaneous ignition of bio fuels, organic materials, garbage, etc.,). This {{is also used to}} design <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> fire crackers. The theory predicted critical values accurately for low conductivity fluids/solids with high conductivity thin walled containers.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from Provisional IRA arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the plastic explosive Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices. The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the raid was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer {{to carry out the}} raid. It would be packed with <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> rammed into the dock gates.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ohio's Miami University, {{he received his}} doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, in 1941. He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, where he researched naval mines. In 1943, he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, he worked with scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky {{on the development of}} the high <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> exploding-bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 24 August, UB-16 {{was again}} patrolling off the Mass Lightship when Hundius stopped Velox, another Norwegian steamer headed for London. Crewmen from UB-16 boarded the 312-ton cargo ship, planted <b>explosives,</b> <b>and</b> sank the vessel and her general cargo. Velox {{was the last}} ship sunk by the UB-16 for nearly eight months, and the last sunk by Hundius before he was {{replaced}} by Oblt. Ernst Müller-Schwarz late in the month. Neither Müller-Schwartz, nor his January 1917 replacement, Oblt. Hans Ewald Niemer, sank any ships while in command of UB-16.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and <b>explosives),</b> <b>and</b> cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E

5|$|Operation Labrador {{was headed}} by Colonel General Slobodan Rakočević, {{head of the}} Yugoslav Air Force branch of the KOS, based in Zemun. In Zagreb, {{operational}} control of Labrador was assigned to Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Sabolović, and Major Čedo Knežević. Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity of explosives in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations. The <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> other munitions were stored across several sites.|$|E
5|$|Overhead a {{considerable}} air battle ensued, {{while in the}} anchorage the naval force continued to bombard the shore line and attack German shipping in the port. On the shore the fighting in the streets continued {{for a number of}} hours and as the Commandos advanced up the main street intelligence teams searched buildings for valuable documents before demolition teams planted <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> destroyed them. Finally, by 13:45 the order for the Commandos to withdraw was given. Withdrawing by troops back down the road, they moved back to the landing craft and by 14:45 they had re-embarked, taking a number of German prisoners and Norwegian volunteers with them.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF), an {{organisation}} of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), {{was formed}} in 1968 to support {{the overthrow of the}} governments of Singapore and Malaysia. The countries had been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the armed struggle included planting booby trap bombs in public places. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
5|$|The final {{source of}} supply was Allied air drops. This {{was the only way}} to obtain more exotic, highly useful {{equipment}} such as plastic <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> antitank weapons such as the British PIAT. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance. Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors (Silent Unseen), 316 of whom were inserted into Poland during the war.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{his doctorate}} from Caltech, Bradner {{worked at the}} US Naval Ordnance Laboratory where he researched naval mines until 1943. He was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project in 1943 at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, which helped to develop the first atomic bomb. Bradner helped to develop {{a wide range of}} technology needed for the bomb, including research on the high <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> exploding-bridgewire detonators needed to implode the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering mechanism, and even helped design the new town around the laboratory. He worked closely {{with some of the most}} prominent scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky. He witnessed the Trinity test, the first nuclear weapons test, at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, <b>explosives,</b> <b>and</b> other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of <b>explosives,</b> <b>and</b> the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
