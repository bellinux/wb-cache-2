25|$|The SM's six {{headlight}} set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. specification cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate glass windshields of the headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, which is why the DS did not <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass windshields at the same time.|$|E

The captain went below to warn the passengers and <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> deck, but it was too late. At about eleven forty-five the ship struck the reef twice, with the second strike causing the starboard side to be ripped wide open and within two minutes the Bokhara had sunk.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that summer}} Mackintosh petitioned for a Commission {{of fire and}} sword against Cameron, unsuccessfully at first but in 1663 he had the whole of Clan Cameron {{declared}} outlaws. The commission against Cameron authorised various noblemen to implement it, but when approached by Mackintosh, they all told him to accept the financial compensation {{that had already been}} offered to him by Cameron. So Mackintosh decided to take matters into his own hands and having failed to induce his neighbours to join him, resorted to bribery to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> his side. Meanwhile, in January 1665, the Duke of Rothes, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, ordered the Commission of Fire and Sword into abeyance until the Privy Council had decided what to do.|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Raskulinecz's production, Lee's vocals and the [...] "fair {{share of}} {{crossover}} hooks", {{adding that the}} band sounded [...] "less tortured tonally even if it remains quite dramatic." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson said, [...] "When [...] uses baroque orchestral accoutrements to wage an air assault on her demons... she's {{more than just the}} token girl in the pit." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album four stars out of five, saying that the band's trademark sound was present on the album [...] "and truth be told, we wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Mark Lepage of the Montreal Gazette praised the album, calling it [...] "one rolling, chugging, plangent epic." [...] According to Chad Grischow of IGN, Evanescence is a [...] "great album that delivers the familiar while {{keeping an eye on the}} future." [...] Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu metal and hard rock, with dramatic orchestration which makes everything sound [...] "big and alive": [...] "With so many extra bells and whistles, despair has never sounded so epic." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe wrote that the album captures [...] "each party elevating the other far above where their proclivities would <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their own." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dutch {{government}} banned unlicensed offshore {{radio on}} 1 September 1974. Radio Caroline continued, moving its headquarters and servicing operation to Spain. Mi Amigo {{moved from the}} Dutch coast to the Knock Deep Channel, approximately [...] from the British coast. After 31 August, shows for Radio Mi Amigo were delivered on cassettes rather than reel-to-reel tapes. Beginning in 1975, the cassettes were transported from Playa d'Aro on the Europa Bus service, which carried people from Amsterdam to Madrid at low prices. The tapes were picked up in Belgium at a bus stop, taken to a small sports plane and dropped in the sea close to the radio ship. The Mi Amigo [...] "Top 50" [...] tapes were flown over by helicopter to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> board more quickly.|$|E
2500|$|One of the film's themes is, {{according}} to Lynch, [...] "finding love in Hell". He has stated [...] "For me, it's just {{a compilation of}} ideas that come along. The darker ones and the lighter ones, the humorous ones, all working together. You {{try to be as}} true as you can to those ideas and try to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> film." [...] Some critics have postulated that, similar to Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting that people who have the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness. Lynch himself, however, refers to the ending of Wild at Heart as being a [...] "happy" [...] one, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.|$|E
2500|$|In the Baltimore office, the {{released}} video lets viewers hear O'Keefe {{saying that}} he and Giles were bringing up thirteen girls from El Salvador [...] "like 15" [...] years of age to live in their house and work as prostitutes [...] "just to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their feet so they can do this type of thing." [...] Giles remarks, [...] "they are kind of dependent." [...] Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, [...] "we {{are going to be}} putting a roof over [...] head", the ACORN employee states, [...] "well then you know what you can always claim them as dependents." [...] Later, the employee says, [...] "you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit." [...] When O'Keefe asks, [...] "what {{if they are going to}} be making money because they are performing tricks too?" [...] the employee replies, [...] "but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting anybody know anyway." [...] The Baltimore employees were fired by ACORN after the video was released.|$|E

Gemma and her family did not speak German, and had no identity papers, money, or means of documenting where they had been. Gemma finally managed to get word to the Americans who contacted La Guardia, who {{had no idea where}} they were. He worked to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the immigration lists, but asserted in a letter, included in the appendix of Gemma's memoir, that her [...] "case was {{the same as that of}} hundreds of thousands of displaced people" [...] and [...] "no exceptions can be made". Thus, despite Gemma's intimate connection with a powerful American politician, who was then director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), it took two years for her to be cleared and sent to the United States. She returned to New York in May 1947, where she was reunited with her brother only four months before he died. As he had made no provision for her, she lived in very reduced circumstances, in a public housing project in Queens, New York, until her death in 1962. Gluck is one of the few American-born women interned by the Nazis. (Another was Virginia d'Albert-Lake.) ...|$|E
