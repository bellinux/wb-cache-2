25|$|Borazon, a {{boron nitride}} allotrope, {{is the fourth}} hardest substance, after {{aggregated}} diamond nanorods, ultrahard fullerite, and diamond, and the third hardest artificial material. Borazon is a crystal created by heating equal quantities of boron and nitrogen at temperatures greater than 1800 °Celsius, 3300 °Fahrenheit at 7 <b>gigapascal</b> 1 millionpound-force per square inch. Borazon was first invented in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf, Jr., a physical chemist working for the General Electric Company.

It is also very incompressible 2, 3, 4, but its high-pressure behaviour is not well understood because it has been studied 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 so far only at pressures below 75 <b>gigapascals.</b> Here we report powder X-ray diffraction measurements on Os at multi-megabar pressures using both conventional and double-stage diamond anvil cells 7, with accurate pressure determination ensured by first obtaining self-consistent equations of state of gold, platinum, and tungsten in static experiments up to 500 <b>gigapascals.</b> These measurements allow us to show that Os retains its hexagonal close-packed structure upon compression to over 770 <b>gigapascals.</b> But although its molar volume monotonically decreases with pressure, the unit cell parameter ratio of Os exhibits anomalies at approximately 150 <b>gigapascals</b> and 440 <b>gigapascals.</b> Dynamical mean-field theory calculations suggest that the former anomaly is a signature of the topological change of the Fermi surface for valence electrons. However, the anomaly at 440 <b>gigapascals</b> might be related to an electronic transition associated with pressure-induced interactions between core electrons. The ability to affect the core electrons under static high-pressure experimental conditions, even for incompressible metals such as Os, opens up opportunities to search for new states of matter under extreme compression...|$|R

40|$|The {{melting curve}} of iron, the primary {{constituent}} of Earth's core, has been measured to pressures of 250 <b>gigapascals</b> {{with a combination}} of static and dynamic techniques.

Corrected for melting point depression resulting from the presence of impurities, a melting temperature for iron-rich alloy of 6600 K at the inner core-outer core boundary and a maximum temperature of 6900 K at Earth's center are inferred. This latter value is the first experimental upper bound on the temperature at Earth's center, and these results imply that the temperature of the lower mantle is significantly less than that of the outer core...|$|R

5000|$|The {{question}} whether pressure is {{an impediment to}} (microbial) life is surprisingly opposite what has been assumed for a long time. Anurag Sharma, a geochemist, James Scott, a microbiologist, {{and others at the}} Carnegie Institution of Washington performed an experiment with Diamond Anvil Cell and utilized [...] "direct observations" [...] on microbial activity to over 1.0 <b>Gigapascal</b> pressures (Sharma et al. 2002, Science).Their goal was to test microbes and discover under what level of pressure they can carry out life processes. The experiments were performed up to 1.6 GPa of pressure, which is more than 16,000 times Earth’s surface pressure (Earth’s surface pressure is 985 hPa). The experiment began by placing a solution of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, in a film and placing it in the DAC. The pressure was then raised to 1.6 GPa. When raised to this pressure and kept there for 30 hours, at least 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution and also monitored formate metabolism using in-situ Raman spectroscopy. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction. The bacteria were also able to cling {{to the surface of the}} DAC with their tails.|$|E
