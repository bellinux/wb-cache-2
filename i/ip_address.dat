5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> These messages carry with them the originating computer's <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

The IPAM {{is used for the}} management and monitoring of Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are fully supported.|$|E
5|$|The {{address on}} Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a {{dilapidated}} flat. An errand {{boy from the}} neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar (Shantilal Mukherjee), an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is {{run over by a}} car during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.|$|E
30|$|In {{this section}} we analyze the {{clustering}} coefficient inside the SpamBands to verify if <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> SpamBands interact more with other <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> in their AS than with <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> from others neighborhoods. The internal clustering coefficient (ICC) of a SpamBand {{is the average}} of the clustering coefficient in each AS considering only the internal connections, i.e., connections among <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> that belong to a same Autonomous System. On the other hand, the external clustering coefficient (ECC) of a SpamBand takes {{the average of the}} clustering coefficient in each AS considering only the external connections, i.e., connections among <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> of different Autonomous Systems.|$|R

5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{finds that}} police across the United States have {{received}} calls from {{witnesses to the}} killing. The police {{believe it to be}} a hoax but Black is convinced of its authenticity. He and fellow Group members Brian Roedecker (Allan Zinyk) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) identify the victim as Rebecca Damsen. Damsen's email correspondence leads them to a San Jose address; Watts finds the bodies of both the owner and Damsen in a nearby graveyard. By the bodies is another number, which they determine to be an <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no indication that the threat was serious.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has {{no support}} for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various {{features}} were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing {{an emphasis on}} cloud computing), such as {{an updated version of}} Hyper-V, an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution. The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20minutes of it concluding in New South Wales. The Nine Network reportedly obtained the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of {{the first person to}} upload the show, and network lawyers were considering legal action. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating the matter, and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E
5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level virtualization {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host. It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own hostname and <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E

There is another number painted on the wall, which Black recognizes as a case file number from {{his time in the}} FBI—the case {{concerned}} Avatar, a serial killer who was able to evade all attempts at capture. Avatar sends Black a coded message twice, and places a woman in the chair on the feed, keeping her face hidden. Roedecker realizes that, through image differencing, the two messages contain additional information—a sound clip from The Mikado, known to be Avatar's favourite operetta.|$|E
50|$|OpenStack Networking {{provides}} networking {{models for}} different applications or user groups. Standard models include flat networks or VLANs that separate servers and traffic. OpenStack Networking manages <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> allowing for dedicated static <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> or DHCP.

5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core routers, {{which are used}} by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, a {{high-quality}} {{recording of the}} Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, {{the vice president of}} Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video, including the <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind Fast flux {{is to have}} {{numerous}} <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> associated with a single fully qualified domain name, where the <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through changing DNS records.|$|R

25|$|Each router has an {{identifier}}, customarily {{written in}} the dotted decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> {{it does not have}} to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{that belong}} to a subnet are {{addressed}} with a common, identical, most-significant bit-group in their <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> This results in the logical division of an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> into two fields, a network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier.

In this case, the CJEU stated in Section 51 that the monitoring of the behavior of Internet users and any further collection of their <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> amounts to an interference with their rights to respect for their private life and their correspondence, since <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> are personal data.|$|R
40|$|The Domain Name System (DNS) {{provides}} a mapping between host names and Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>addresses.</b> Hosts that are configured using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) {{can have their}} assigned <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> updated in a Dynamic DNS (DDNS). DNS and DDNS are critical components of the Internet. Most applications use host names rather than <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> allowing the underlying operating system (OS) to translate these host names to <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> {{on behalf of the}} application. When the DDNS service is unavailable, applications that use DNS cannot contact the hosts served by that DDNS server. Unfortunately, the current DDNS implementation cannot continue to operate under failure of a master DNS server. Although a slave DNS server can continue to translate names to <b>addresses,</b> new <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> or changes to existing <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> cannot be added. Therefore, those new hosts cannot be reached by the DDNS. A new architecture is presented that eliminates this single point of failure.
