5000|$|In 2011, two wild Pacific salmon {{taken from}} the central coast of British Columbia were {{suspected}} to have ISA after preliminary tests showed possible evidence of the virus. However, extensive testing by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to try to amplify and culture the virus were unsuccessful, prompting the agency {{to conclude that the}} ISA virus was not present. In February 2012, a confirmed outbreak of ISA in Nova Scotia resulted in the destruction of up to 750,000 salmon. In July 2012, a confirmed outbreak of infectious salmon anemia in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, prompted the destruction of 450,000 farmed salmon by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and an outbreak was also confirmed at another site in late 2012. In mid-2012, another outbreak was identified in Nova Scotia, with the 240,000 fish being allowed <b>by</b> <b>CFIA</b> to mature to market size before being harvested in early 2013 by the operator and processed for the consumer market. After being held <b>by</b> the <b>CFIA,</b> the fish was declared fit for human consumption despite the presence of the virus as the disease [...] "poses no risk to human health". In January 2016, it was announced that the virus had been discovered in farmed and wild salmon British Columbia for the first time.|$|R

40|$|Rna 15 is a core subunit of {{cleavage}} factor IA (CFIA), {{an essential}} transcriptional 3 ′-end processing factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CFIA {{is required for}} polyA site selection/cleavage targeting RNA sequences that surround polyadenylation sites in the 3 ′-UTR of RNA polymerase-II transcripts. RNA recognition <b>by</b> <b>CFIA</b> is mediated <b>by</b> an RNA recognition motif (RRM) contained in the Rna 15 subunit of the complex. We show here that Rna 15 has a strong and unexpected preference for GU containing RNAs and reveal the molecular basis for a base selectivity mechanism that accommodates G or U but discriminates against C and A bases. This mode of base selectivity is rather different to that observed in other RRM-RNA structures and is structurally conserved in CstF 64, the mammalian counterpart of Rna 15. Our observations provide evidence for a highly conserved mechanism of base recognition amongst the 3 ′-end processing complexes that interact with the U-rich or U/G-rich elements at 3 ′-end cleavage/polyadenylation sites...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{antimicrobial}} resistance in {{members of the}} Bacteroides fragilis group is a concern in clinical medicine. Although met-ronidazole and carbapenem resistance {{have been reported in}} Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the B. fragilis group, they have not, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, been reported together in the same B. thetaiotaomicron isolate. Herein, we report isolation of piperacillin-tazobactam-, metronidazole-, clindamycin-, ertapenem-, and meropenem-resistant B. thetaiotaomicron from a patient with postoperative intra-abdominal abscess and empyema. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated the pres-ence of nimDwith at least a portion of IS 1169 upstream, a second putative nim gene, two-lactamase genes (one of which has not been previously reported), two tetX genes, tetQ, ermF, two cat genes, and a number of efflux pumps. This report highlights emerging {{antimicrobial resistance}} in B. thetaiotaomicron and the importance of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected anaerobic bacteria. Increasing antimicrobial resistance has been reported in mem-bers of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Carbapenem resistance is rare and has been associated with expression of a metallo [...] lac-tamase encoded <b>by</b> <b>cfiA,</b> although other mechanisms have been reported. Metronidazole resistance is also rare, and though its mechanisms are incompletely delineated, it has been associated with plasmid-borne and chromosomal nim genes as well as efflu...|$|R
40|$|Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) {{has adopted}} the term {{cyanosis}} {{to describe a}} category of condemnation for poultry that is dark but has no other condemnable lesions. Two case-control studies (n = 30 pairs; n = 65 pairs) of 18 -wk-old tom turkeys were conducted. A case {{was defined as a}} carcass condemned by the veterinary inspector for cyanosis, and a control carcass was one that passed inspection. Microbiological tests were conducted on samples of Pectoralis major and Gastrocnemius lacteralis. A modified Rappaport Vassiliadis medium was used for Salmonella, and a Petrifilm method was used to assess aerobic counts, coliform counts, and Escherichia coli. The Salmonella (qualitative) test was negative for all cases and controls, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the aerobic counts, coliform counts, and E. coli counts of case and control carcasses. Two pathologists conducted a blind histopathological study: there were no lesions compatible with those of septicemia-toxemia, as defined <b>by</b> <b>CFIA</b> and the USDA, nor any significant histopathological differences between the skin, P. major, G. lateralis, kidney, liver, spleen, small intestine, pancreas, lung, and heart of cases and controls. The inter-rater agreement between pathologists ranged from good to excellent (Kappa = 0. 7 to 1. 0). In the absence of important lesions and microbial contamination, carcasses with this color change alone should be suitable for human consumption.
