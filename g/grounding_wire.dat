40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analize the effect of {{indirect}} lightning strikes on the 13. 8 kV distribution network at BOB PT. BSP - Pertamina Hulu Bandar Pedada by using ATP-EMTP. Maximum induced voltage of indirect lightning is computed by using Rusck theory, then indirect lightning strikes are simulated by using ATP-EMTP. In this paper, five conditions are simulated. The first condition is the distribution line without the indirect lightning strikes with 15 kV lightning arresters and the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed, the second condition is the indirect lightning strikes without the 15 kV lightning arresters and <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> the third condition is indirect lightning strikes with the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed and without the 15 kV lightning arrester, the fourth condition is the indirect lightning strikes with 15 kV lightning arresters are installed and without the <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> and the fifth condition is the indirect lightning strikes with the 15 kV lightning arresters and <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is installed. The simulation results show that the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> is able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect lightning strikes, the 15 kV lightning arresters are able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect lightning strikes, and the best results are obtained when the <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> and the 15 kV lightning arresters are installed on the distribution line...|$|R

5000|$|The J-pole design {{functions}} {{well when}} fed with a balanced feed (via balun, transformer or choke) and no electrical connection exists between its conductors and surrounding supports. Historical {{documentation of the}} J antenna suggests {{the lower end of}} the matching stub is at zero potential with respect to earth and can connect to a <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> or mast with no effect on the antenna's operation. [...] Later research confirms the tendency of the mast or <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> to draw current from the antenna potentially spoiling the antenna pattern. [...] A common approach extends the conductor below the bottom of the J-pole resulting in additional and undesirable RF currents flowing over every part of the mounting structure. [...] This modifies the far field antenna pattern typically, but not always, raising the primary lobes above the horizon reducing antenna effectiveness for terrestrial service. [...] J-pole antennas with electrical connection to their supports often fare no better, and often much worse, than the simpler Monopole antenna.

With ground-insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the <b>grounding</b> <b>wire.</b> In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct.|$|E
5000|$|OPGW as a {{communication}} medium has some advantages over buried optical fiber cable. Installation cost per kilometre {{is lower than}} a buried cable. Effectively, the optical circuits are protected from accidental contact by the high voltage cables below (and by the elevation of the OPGW from ground).

40|$|Given {{the fact}} that the {{installing}} costs of an optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> on overhead lines directly depend on its cross-section, which in turn depends on the level of fault current it should withstand, in order to reduce these current values in the optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> I suggested performing its isolated descents from the end towers of the line with its transition to an optical cable. The research was carried out on the example of a 500 kV overhead line in the National Electric Power Grid. The Method of Symmetrical Components for calculating asymmetrical fault currents was not used; therefore, calculations were carried out on the base of presenting the line as a multi-wire system for the considered case as a five-wire system (optical <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> steel <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> and three phase wires). Such approach allows taking into account the initial asymmetry of the line parameters and modeling any kind of asymmetrical faults. The analyses of calculated results were performed.

5000|$|To {{dissipate}} atmospheric charge buildup, {{one side}} of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every support pole. The one earth-connected wire is commonly referred to as the [...] "protective earth", and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric <b>grounding</b> <b>wire</b> that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become [...] "electrically live" [...] via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch.|$|E
50|$|This {{practice}} {{arose from}} the three-wire system used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these listed appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the protective <b>grounding</b> <b>wire,</b> which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|E

5000|$|On November 7, 2005 Torakev {{performed}} {{his first}} career spacewalk. The {{beginning of the}} spacewalk was delayed about an hour to repressurize the Quest airlock's crew compartment. During the 5 hours, 22 minutes spacewalk, He and NASA astronaut William McArthur installed a new camera assembly and jettisoned the Floating Potential Probe. They also completed two get-ahead tasks. Tokarev wore an all-white suit for the spacewalk. Their first primary task was the camera assembly installation on the Port 1 Truss. The two spacewalkers spent about 2 hours, 10 minutes on the installation. In order to have daylight for the Floating Potential Probe (FPP) jettison, they {{moved on to the}} retrieval of a failed remote joint motor controller. Once it was completed, the pair with MacArthur in the lead then moved up the P6 truss to the FPP. The dysfunctional FPP had been designed to measure the space station's electrical potential and compare it to the surrounding plasma. Tokarev and McArthur released and stowed a <b>grounding</b> <b>wire,</b> then released the FPP housing from its stanchion. They checked its condition and McArthur carefully jettisoned the FPP. The FFP removal and jettisoning took an hour to complete. The two spacealkers next removed and replaced a remote power controller module on the mobile transporter. After completing all the tasks the pair returned to the Quest airlock at 3:54 EST. [...] On February 3, 2006, Torakev performed his second career spacewalk. He and McArthur donned in red-striped Orlan suits, ventured outside the ISS at 5:44 p.m. EST from the Pirs docking comapartment airlock to begin the spacewalk. During the spacewalk, Tokarev and McArthur relocated a boom adapter for the Strela, a Russian hand-operated crane, from the Zarya module to Pressurized Mating Adapter 3. They also retrieved experiments and inspected and photographed parts of the station's exterior. The two spacewalkers also jettisoned an old Russian Orlan spacesuit equipped with a radio for broadcasts to students around the world. The suit, dubbed SuitSat-1 had reached the end of its operational life for spacewalks in August 2004. It was outfitted by the crew with three batteries, internal sensors and a radio transmitter for this experiment. The SuitSat-1 had recorded greetings in six languages to ham radio operators for about two orbits of the Earth before it stopped transmitting The suit was expected to enter the atmosphere and burn up in {{a few weeks after the}} spacewalk. The spacewalk ended when the two re-entered the Pirs airlock and closed its hatch at 11:27 p.m. EST. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 43 minutes.|$|E
