5000|$|The buffy-crowned <b>wood</b> <b>partridge</b> (Dendrortyx leucophrys) is {{a species}} of bird in the Odontophoridae family. It is found in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. Small groups forage in underbrush, secondary growth, near forest clearings and coffee plantations. The species local name is [...] "chir-ras-qua" [...] after its noisy call. It has a chicken-like appearance due to its long tail and legs. Its pale iris and streaked neck differentiates it from other quail like birds.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 430 avian-derived fecal {{specimens}} were randomly collected from selected Western Australian commercial aviaries, poultry farms, hatcheries, wildlife parks, and the Perth Zoo and screened {{for the presence}} of Cryptosporidium by PCR. Of these, 27 Cryptosporidium-positive isolates were detected, characterized, and compared with 11 avian-derived isolates from the Czech Republic at the 18 S rRNA and actin gene loci. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis identified four genetically distinct genotypes, avian genotypes I to IV, from various avian hosts. In addition, the host range for Cryptosporidium galli was extended. Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium andersoni were also identified in a tawny frogmouth and a quail-crested <b>wood</b> <b>partridge,</b> respectively...|$|R
5000|$|... "The local {{word for}} a rocky hill is 'tolt' {{and there is an}} {{interesting}} story surrounding the origin of Hannah's Tolt, located inland from Northern Bay near Welsh's Pond. It occurred probably in the 1920s or 1930s. Late in the fall of the year when a crowd of women were in the woods berry-picking, Hannah Milley and her daughter must have been separated from the main group of women when a snowstorm suddenly broke out. They never made it back to the community. Search parties failed to turn up the bodies, but about 17 years later, a man named Lewis Crummey was in the <b>woods</b> <b>partridge</b> hunting and he found the two bodies and their rusted berry buckets down {{at the base of a}} tolt, which was then nicknamed Hannah's Tolt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wenge ( [...] ) is a {{tropical}} timber, very dark in color with a distinctive figure {{and a strong}} <b>partridge</b> <b>wood</b> pattern. The wood is heavy and hard, suitable for flooring and staircases.Also, common in race cars.|$|R
60|$|Of the {{feathered}} tribes {{there are}} the large and small grey Canada goose, the laughing goose (so called from the resemblance of its cry to laughter), and the wavie or white goose. The latter are not very numerous. There are great numbers of wild ducks, pintails, widgeons, divers, sawbills, black ducks, and teal; but the prince of ducks (the canvas-back) is not there. In spring and autumn the whole country becomes musical with the wild cries and shrill whistle of immense hosts of plover of all kinds--long legs, short legs, black legs, and yellow legs--sandpipers and snipe, which are assisted in their noisy concerts by myriads of frogs. The latter are really the best songsters in Hudson Bay [see note 2]. Bitterns are {{also found in the}} marshes; and sometimes, though rarely, a solitary crane finds its way to the coast. In the woods, and among the dry places around, there are a few grey grouse and <b>wood</b> <b>partridges,</b> a great many hawks, and owls of all sizes-- from the gigantic white owl, which measures five feet across the back and wings, to the small grey owl, not much bigger than a man's hand.|$|R
50|$|A {{memorial}} at {{the site}} of the massacre in present-day Chicago, Illinois includes a statue of Black Partridge preventing a tomahawk from hitting a Mrs. Margaret Helm, the wife of one of the defenders at Fort Dearborn.

60|$|There {{is no need}} {{to follow}} in detail the long journey which Hearne had to take in order to {65} return to the fort. The march lasted nearly a year, during which he was exposed to the same hardship, famine and danger as {{on his way to the}} sea. The route {{followed}} on the return was different. The party ascended the valley of the Coppermine as far as Point Lake, a considerable body of water visited later by Franklin, and distant one hundred and sixty miles from the sea. This was reached on September 3, 1771. Four months were spent in travelling almost directly south. They passed over a rugged country of stone and marsh, buried deep in snow, with here and there a clump of stunted pine or straggling willow. Bitter weather with great gales and deep snow set in in October. Snow-shoes and sledges were made. Many small lakes and rivers, now fast frozen, were traversed, but the whole country is still so little known that Hearne's path can hardly be traced with certainty. By the middle of November the clumps of trees thickened into the northern edge of the great forest. The way now became easier. They had better shelter from the wind, and firewood was abundant. For food the party carried dried meat from Point Lake, and as they passed into the thicker woods they were fortunate enough to find a few rabbits and <b>wood</b> <b>partridges.</b> {66} Some fish were caught through the ice of the river. But in nearly two months of walking only two deer were seen.|$|R

60|$|Our first, {{night in}} the Bear Island camp passed without incident, and we all slept profoundly, tired out by the labors of the day before. After breakfast, the Four set out to explore, with trout-rods and shot-guns. Bear Island is, with the {{exception}} of the cove into which we had put, as nearly round as an island can be, and perhaps three miles in diameter. It has two clear brooks which, owing to the comparative inaccessibility of the place, still contain trout and grayling, though there are few spots where a fly can be cast on account of the dense underbrush. The <b>woods</b> contain <b>partridge,</b> or ruffed grouse, and other game in smaller quantities. I believe my client entertained some notion of establishing a preserve here.|$|R
50|$|The park {{provides}} important {{habitat for}} endangered species including the snow leopard, grey wolf, musk deer, and blue sheep. Goral, great Tibetan sheep, Himalayan tahr, leopard, jackal, Himalayan black bear and yellow-throated marten {{are also found}} in the park. The park is home to six reptiles and 29 species of butterfly, including the highest flying butterfly in the world, Paralasa nepalaica. The park provides habitat for over 200 species of birds, such as Tibetan <b>partridge,</b> <b>wood</b> snipe, white-throated tit, wood accentor and crimson-eared rosefinch.|$|R
50|$|Millettia stuhlmannii, {{commonly}} known as panga panga, is a well-known species of timber tree that is native to the southeastern Afrotropics. The alternative name <b>partridge</b> <b>wood</b> refers to the light and dark patterns of its heartwood, which is said to form ‘partridge-breast’ figures. The wood of the tropical species M. laurentii has similar qualities and uses, but is slightly darker, and lacks the copious yellowish white resin of the heartwood vessels. Its foliage {{is similar to that}} of Pterocarpus rotundifolius, and it may be confused with the latter when observed from a distance.|$|R
50|$|Andira inermis is a nitrogen-fixing tree {{native to}} the area from {{southern}} Mexico through Central America to northern South America (Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil); it has been introduced to the Caribbean, the Antilles, Florida, and Africa. The tree has many names due to its wide distribution and multiple uses: it {{is also known as}} the cabbage bark (in Belize), almendro macho (in El Salvador), almendro de río or river almond (Honduras), bastard cabbage tree, cabbage angelin (United States), cabbage bark (United States), cabbage tree, carne asada (Costa Rica), guacamayo (Honduras), Jamaica cabbage tree, moca (Puerto Rico), <b>partridge</b> <b>wood</b> (United States), worm bark, or yellow cabbage tree.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the ground}} was not yet quite covered, and again {{near the end of}} winter, when the snow was melted on my south {{hillside}} and about my wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever side you walk in the <b>woods</b> the <b>partridge</b> bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, [...] "sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two." [...] I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of the woods at sunset to [...] "bud" [...] the wild apple trees. They will come regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed, at any rate. It is Nature's own bird which lives on buds and diet drink.|$|R
6000|$|We {{crossed a}} deep wide bay north of Kineo, leaving an island on our left and keeping up {{the eastern side}} of the lake. We then crossed another broad bay, which, as we could no longer observe the shore particularly, afforded ample time for conversation. The Indian said that he had got his money by hunting, mostly high up the West Branch of the Penobscot, and toward the head of the St. John. He had hunted there from a boy, and knew all about that region. His game had been beaver, otter, black cat (or fisher), sable, moose, etc. Canada lynx were plenty yet in burnt grounds. For food in the <b>woods</b> he uses <b>partridges,</b> ducks, dried moose meat, hedgehog, etc. Loons, too, were good, only [...] "bile 'em good." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Ramsar definition, {{more than}} two-thirds of the country’s landmass may be {{classified}} as wetlands. It is a country dominated by wetland including estuaries, mangrove swamps namely the Sundarbans, freshwater marshes such as haor, swamps and rivers. There are about 628 bird species in Bangladesh, of which 244 are Migratory. About 100 species of migratory birds regularly or occasionally visit the country. Considering the present threats to waterbird conservation in the country, 31 migratory waterbird species are of high priority for future action for conservation. 14 of these species are threatened.The wetlands are home to about 70 species of resident waterbirds including ducks, grebe, cormorants, bitterns, herons, egrets, storks, rails, jacanas, finfoot, waders, gulls, turns and skimmers. Eleven species of resident waterbirds are identified as threatened. The important threatened species are masked finfoot, Indian skimmer, black-headed ibis, greater adjutant, lesser adjutant, Baikal teal, Baer's pochard, <b>ferruginous</b> pochard, <b>wood</b> snipe, Nordmann's greenshank and spoon-billed sandpiper. [...] The wetlands of Bangladesh are being degraded rapidly due to population pressure, withdrawal of water for irrigation, destruction of swamp forest and many other anthropogenic and natural causes. Large scale habitat conversion, unsustainable harvesting policies and lack of ecological considerations have led to the destruction of valuable wetland habitat for water birds and other associated biodiversity. Immediate action is required for restoring these habitats and conserving the water birds in Bangladesh. The Key breeding and staging areas of Bangladesh are: Haor areas such as the Meghna estuary, Tanguar haor and Hail-Hakaluki haors, Chalan Beel, the Sundarbans and other coastal mangroves including Hatia and Nijhum Dweep, haor areas of the north west and off shore Islands.|$|R
60|$|The mosses and lichens, green, sulphur, and amber, stud {{the copper}} floor of needles, where the {{feathery}} ground-pine runs aimlessly {{to and fro}} along the ground, spelling out broken words of half-forgotten charms. There are checker-berries {{on the outskirts of}} the <b>wood,</b> where the <b>partridge</b> (he is a ruffed grouse really) dines, and by the deserted logging-roads toadstools of all colours sprout on the decayed stumps. Wherever a green or blue rock lifts from the hillside, the needles have been packed and matted round its base, till, when the sunshine catches them, stone and setting together look no meaner than turquoise in dead gold. The woods are full of colour, belts and blotches of it, the colours of the savage--red, yellow, and blue. Yet in their lodges there is very little life, for the wood-people do not readily go into the shadows. The squirrels have their business among the beeches and hickories by the road-side, where they can watch the traffic and talk. We have no gray ones hereabouts (they are good to eat and suffer for it), but five reds live in a hickory hard by, and no weather puts them to sleep. The wood-chuck, a marmot and a strategist, makes his burrow in the middle of a field, where he must see you ere you see him. Now and again a dog manages to cut him off his base, and the battle is worth crossing fields to watch. But the woodchuck turned in long ago, and will not be out till April. The coon lives--well, no one seems to know particularly where Brer Coon lives, but when the Hunter's Moon is large and full he descends into the corn-lands, and men chase him with dogs for his fur, which makes the finest kind of overcoat, and his flesh, which tastes like chicken. He cries at night sorrowfully as though a child were lost.|$|R
