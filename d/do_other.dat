5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than <b>do</b> <b>other</b> loons.|$|E
5|$|In the forests, {{endangered}} birds {{such as the}} yellowhead (mohua) and kakariki (New Zealand parakeet) occur, as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> birds such as the tui, fantail (piwakawaka), and kererū (New Zealand pigeon). One of New Zealand's {{only two}} native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E

5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Most of the wing-level staff {{positions}} {{fit into}} various departments led by directors.

5|$|The Catlins coast often hosts New Zealand {{fur seals}} and Hooker's sea lions, and {{occasionally}} southern elephant seals can be seen. Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho), as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers {{are home to}} herons, stilts, godwits and oystercatchers. Bitterns and the threatened fernbird (matata) can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as a childish clown, Naruto seeks {{attention}} {{as he was}} ridiculed during his childhood. To be accepted and respected, he resolves to become Konohagakure's Hokage and surpass all previous leaders, no matter the difficulties. While becoming a ninja, Naruto forms friendships that he initially lacked, linking {{some of them to}} family relationships. Although Naruto sometimes finds himself unable to accomplish the tasks he proposes to <b>do,</b> <b>other</b> characters believe that he will be an excellent Hokage because of his positive impact on their lives.|$|E
5|$|Mammoths {{continued}} growing during adulthood, as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> elephants. Males grew {{until age}} 40, and females until age 25. Mammoths {{may have had}} gestation periods of 21–22 months, like those of modern elephants. Columbian mammoths had six sets of molars {{in the course of}} a lifetime. At 6–12 months the second set of molars would erupt, with the first set worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for ten years, and this process was repeated until the sixth set emerged at 30 years of age. When the last set of molars wore out the animal would be unable to chew, and would die of starvation.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden. They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and the {{students}} of Springfield Elementary go {{on a field trip}} to the post office, Bart gets a coupon book as a souvenir, which he gives to Homer as a birthday present. Homer uses one of his coupons at a tire business on a free wheel balancing, but is informed that all four tires in his car are faulty and need to be replaced. While waiting for the new tires, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. They go to Moe's and watch a special on the Super Bowl on TV. Wally says his agency has a charter bus going to the game and suggests to Homer that he can fill the bus and ride for free. Moe agrees to come as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> prominent men of Springfield.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star.

Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E

5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left with nothing to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop {{if it was not}} either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Tommy Vercetti (Ray Liotta), a loyal {{former member}} of the Forelli Family, is {{released}} from prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence. His former boss, Sonny Forelli (Tom Sizemore), ostensibly promotes Tommy to a caporegime and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer in a cocaine deal and to also <b>do</b> <b>other</b> ground work for the Forellis. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg (William Fichtner) takes them in his car to the docks; the site of the deal. They are ambushed by several masked men, who kill their bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, losing the Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. After Ken returns to his office, Tommy drives back to his hotel and informs Sonny, promising him under the threat of consequences to get back the drugs and money and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.|$|E

5|$|Prisoners in the Agra jail {{were trained}} and kept {{employed}} as carpet weavers {{as part of}} their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General Thomas Dennehy, who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table, and learn to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> tasks.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than <b>do</b> <b>other</b> nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as <b>do</b> <b>other</b> journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
