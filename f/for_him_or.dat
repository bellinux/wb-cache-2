5|$|His goals helped Symes land December's League Two Player of the Month and {{an offer}} of a {{contract}} extension by Accrington to fend off reported interest from other clubs during the January 2010 transfer window. However, Symes announced he would not sign a new contract during the transfer window increasing the chance he could leave on a free transfer during the summer on a Bosman ruling transfer. Two weeks later, Accrington announced they had rejected two bids from fellow League Two side Grimsby Town for their striker. One bid included striker Barry Conlon moving in the opposite direction. The second bid {{was reported to be}} a six-figure sum. Symes continued his rich vein of form as his 14thgoal of the season—making it his most productive season to date—levelled the scoring against Premier League Fulham in the FA Cup fourth round. A victory would have given Stanley a fifth round place {{for the first time in}} their history, but they eventually lost 3–1. In the crowd at the club's following game was Preston North End's new manager Darren Ferguson to become Symes' latest suitor. Despite the interest in Symes, no further bids were reported by Accrington <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> for midfielder Bobby Grant as the January transfer window closed. Symes finished the season with 19goals—his best return of his career to that point—with 13 of those coming in the league.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, {{when he or she}} must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E

25|$|British railway {{signalling}} {{is unusual}} in that it employs the direction signalling philosophy, rather than that of speed signalling; in other words, a driver is informed of which route he will take at a junction, rather than {{the speed at which}} he should travel through it. This probably stems from the early days of railways when points and signals were not interlocked, and it was therefore important for a driver to know whether the points had been correctly set <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> not, and has stuck ever since.|$|E

This was contrary to PAFA policy, and Eakins was reprimanded in a January 11 letter by Director of Education Edward Hornor Coates. But the incident ignited controversy, including charges that Eakins had cavorted nude with his students, had manipulated them into posing nude <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> for each other, had photographed them nude, {{and that he did}} not possess the moral character to be a teacher at PAFA.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> even for anyone more powerful than him, to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is hard to imagine that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E
25|$|The colours {{were then}} struck to Éveillé, upon which her {{commander}} demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering {{that if he}} was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> else he would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty rug, and did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it a disgrace, and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had it happened to him.|$|E

6000|$|The {{principle}} {{which he}} deduces from these considerations is--'that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in {{interfering with the}} liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection; the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.

25|$|The {{office is}} not {{established}} by any constitution or law but exists only by long-established convention, which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as Prime Minister the person {{most likely to}} command {{the confidence of the}} House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688–1720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament. Although the Sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 468, Leo {{organized}} a grand {{campaign against the}} Vandals in Africa in which the East and West would commit substantial forces. Marcellinus was given command of the forces from the western empire and the campaign {{was to be a}} three-pronged assault. Marcellinus by this time had expelled the Vandals from Sicily and had also retaken Sardinia and was to be taken by fleet to Africa. Basiliscus, Leo's brother-in-law, with the main army in an armada of over 1,000 ships would land at a distance from Carthage and link up with the comes rei militis Heraclius advancing from Egypt and Tripolitana. Marcellinus was supposed to have a command of some 10,000 to 20,000 troops. Marcellinus never sailed for Africa, perhaps due to Ricimer's veto; either he would not spare so many troops to become bogged in a campaign in Africa hoping the East would do the job <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> he resented the military capabilities of Marcellinus who was obviously the favorite of Anthemius. Regardless of the reason, Marcellinus, not able to participate in the campaign and Basiliscus blundering in the Battle of Cape Bon, assured that the operation would result in failure and the West lost its only chance to regain Africa from the Vandals and possibly stave off its demise.|$|E
