When Cronos devoured their children {{in an attempt to}} cheat the prophecy that one of his children would become greater than him, Rhea tricked Cronos and ensured the young Zeus was <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> and protected by Gaia. Rhea's fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud <b>hidden</b> <b>away,</b> Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> from the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Von Stroheim's {{original}} edit contained {{two main}} sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted {{the lives of}} the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches <b>hidden</b> <b>away,</b> Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground that gave him god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except one young man survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra from the plane wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy polarities, black and white.|$|E

It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is <b>hidden</b> <b>away</b> in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.|$|E

25|$|The Jokhang owns a {{large and}} very {{important}} collection of about eight hundred metal sculptures, in addition to thousands of painted scrolls known as thangkas.

During numerous visits to the Jokhang between 1980 and 1996, Ulrich von Schroeder managed to take photographs of about five hundred metal statues of interest. Among them are some extremely rare and important brass and copper statues originating from Kashmir, Northern India, Nepal, Tibet, and China. However, the most important statues of the Jokhang collection are those that date back to the Yar lung dynasty (7th–9th century).|$|E
