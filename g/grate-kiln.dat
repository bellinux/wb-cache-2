40|$|Deposit {{formation}} in the <b>grate-kiln</b> process is a challenge for the iron ore pellet production industry. The deposits cause disturbances that affect the production capacity of the pelletizing plant. To prevent or mitigate these occurrences, {{it is important to}} understand the deposit formation mechanism during the process, which is the overall goal of this work. The results from this work can be used to enhance the understanding of deposit {{formation in}} the iron ore pelletizing industry. In this work, particle and deposit formations were studied both in a full-scale <b>grate-kiln</b> plant (40 MW) and in a pilot-scale pulverised coal-fired furnace (400 kW). The sampled particles and deposits were characterized with scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), laser diffraction (CILAS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). In the first part of this work, the initiating step in deposit formation— i. e. particle formation mechanisms— was investigated. Particles were sampled from the transfer chute in a full-scale <b>grate-kiln</b> production plant during combustion of oil and coal in separate firings. The results showed that particles in the flue gas consisted principally of fragments from iron ore pellets and minor ashes from heavy fuel oil and pulverised coal combustion. Three categories of particle modes were identified: (1) a submicron mode consisting of condensed products from vaporized species that had relatively high concentrations of Na and K for both combustion cases, with high concentrations of Cl and S during heavy fuel oil combustion, and high concentrations of Si, Fe and minor P, Ca and Al during coal combustion (2) a first fragmentation mode consisting of both iron ore pellet fines and fly ash particles with a significant amount of Fe (> 65 wt %) for both combustion cases, with high concentrations of Ca and Si during heavy fuel oil combustion and high concentrations of Si and Al during coal combustion (3) a second fragmentation mode consisting almost entirely of coarse iron ore pellet fines, predominantly Fe (~ 90 wt %). The particles in the flue gas were dominated by iron ore fines within the second fragmentation mode, which contributed > 96 wt % of the total mass of collected particles. In the second part of this work, short-term deposits were collected at the same location in the <b>grate-kiln</b> as the collection of particles. They were characterized by their chemical composition and microstructure in order to obtain information about the deposit formation. Deposit sampling was carried out during separate combustion firings of oil and coal. A significant difference in the deposition behaviour was observed: deposition during oil firing was negligible compared with coal firing. The deposits from coal firing were mainly fine-grained iron oxide particles embedded in a molten (bonding) phase that comprised mainly of Si, Al, Fe, Ca and O. Moreover, it was found that the prevailing flue gas direction determines the formation of the deposits on the probe and that inertial impaction controls the deposition rate. However, this rate can also be affected significantly by the amount of entrained particles that were present in the kiln. In the third part of this work, two different coals were combusted both in a full-scale <b>grate-kiln</b> plant and in a pilot-scale pulverized coal-fired furnace (ECF). The ECF is designed as a scaled-down <b>grate-kiln</b> for combustion testing. Particle and short-term deposit samplings were carried out in both appliances. Dust originating from iron ore pellets was only present in the <b>grate-kiln</b> as there was no flow of iron ore pellets in the ECF. The results showed that Na, K and Cl contents in submicron mode were higher in the <b>grate-kiln</b> than in the ECF, due to alkali circulation in the <b>grate-kiln.</b> The coarse mode particles (2. 6 - 4. 2 μm) sampled from the <b>grate-kiln</b> contained significantly more Fe, which originated from the iron ore pellets. The presence of coarse particles (> 6 μm) was substantial (> 96 wt % of the total particle mass) in the <b>grate-kiln</b> but insignificant in the ECF. The short-term deposits from the <b>grate-kiln</b> consisted of a variety of particles from both iron ore pellets and coal ash particles embedded in an iron-rich silicate molten phase. Short-term deposits from the <b>grate-kiln</b> were harder and denser compared to the shortterm deposits from the ECF. Short-term deposits from the ECF were porous and consisted of coal ash particles embedded in a silicate molten phase. The molten phase in short-term deposits from the gratekiln had a higher Fe content and a higher CaO/(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) ratio than the molten phase from the ECF short-term deposits. Thermochemical calculations showed that the molten phase in the short-term deposits from the <b>grate-kiln</b> had a lower viscosity compared to the molten phase in short-term deposits from the ECF.

40|$|LKAB {{is a state}} owned, Swedish {{mining company}} that {{produces}} iron ore products for the steel making industries, mainly iron ore pellets. The final process of heat treating iron ore pellets, which is done in a <b>Grate-kiln,</b> is the most energy consuming part of the refining process. This {{has led to a}} collaboration between LKAB and the Division of Energy Technology at Chalmers to make the <b>Grate-kiln</b> more energy efficient. With help from an in-house simulation model by LKAB, earlier work within this collaboration has suggested process changes that makes this process more energy efficient. The simulation model describes the heat and mas transfer through the whole <b>Grate-kiln</b> process. The simulation model is believed to perform well under standard running condition, but has difficulty to evaluate the process when large changes are made in the running settings. Therefore, this work has been to validate the simulation model against an experimental test rig, so called pot furnace, where it was the grate performance from the <b>Grate-kiln</b> that was analysed. Measurements were taken from the pot furnace and compared with the calculations from the simulation program. The key parameters and processes used for comparison were the temperatures, the degree of oxidation, the drying process and the pressure drop. The outcome from this study has shown that the results from the simulation model regarding the oxidization process correlate with the measured results from the pot furnace. Temperature measurements from the pot furnace showed a lower value than the simulation model due to the limitations in the pot furnace. Pressure drop is well calculated, but it is concluded that either mismeasurements regarding the pellets in the pot furnace occur or that the simulation model overestimated one or several variables. The drying process has been proved to be the most difficult parameter to predict by the bed model. This partly due to the regulating process in the pot furnace and also calculation faults in the bed model. From this study, further work should focus on these parameters when evaluating the bed model. It should also focus on comparing the simulation model with a new developed pot furnace and also the full scale <b>Grate-kiln</b> process...|$|E

The aim with this research project is to numerically investigate if {{it is possible to}} use selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) technologies in <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizingplants for NOx reduction. The technique had, to the best knowledge of the author, never been used in this context before despite that it is commonly used in cement and waste incineration plants. The investigation is done in several stages: 1) Reveal if the technique is possible to use with the two most commonly reagents ammonia and urea. 2) Derive a chemistry model for cyanuric acid so that this reagent also can be scrutinized. 3) Compare the reagents urea and cyanuric acid in the <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizing process. A CFD model of parts of the real grate was created and numerical simulations with the commercial code ANSYS CFX was carried out solving the flow field. A model for spray injection into the grate was then included in the model enabling a study of the overall mixing between the injected reagent droplets and the NOx polluted air. It is shown that the SNCR technique with ammonia does not work in the <b>grate-kiln</b> process. Urea on the other hand can be used under some conditions and also cyanuric acid.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines, in {{cooperation}} with Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. (Hibbing, MN), investigated ways of enhancing the quality (compressive strength, after-tumble and reducibility) of domestic acid and fluxed magnetite pellets by modifying the oxygen content during the preheat and induration periods of the firing operation. Oxidation of magnetite was best accomplished when sufficient oxygen and time were available before the peak induration temperature was reached. The rate of magnetite oxidation increased directly with the gas oxygen content during the preheat period at 7000 C and above. With 30 pct (or more) O 2 and a preheat rate of 2000 C/min, most of the magnetite was oxidized during the preheat period. With laboratory tube and mini-pot furnace tests, oxygen enrichment during the preheat period improved the pellet properties more in the simulated <b>grate-kiln</b> tests than in the simulated straight-grate tests. The longer induration period with the <b>grate-kiln</b> test resulted in more sintering of the residual magnetite and its reaction with the silicon compounds.

Three cases of coal and co-firing are in this work studied and evaluated using a detailed radiation model. The model treats the furnace as an axisymmetric and infinitely long cylinder. Overall, the differences in radiative intensities and heat fluxes between the three studied fuel combinations are minor which implies that introduction of renewable fuels by co-firing in a full scale rotary kiln should be feasible with respect to heat transfer conditions.

40|$|This master thesis uses process {{modelling}} to investigate energy efficiency {{measures in the}} <b>grate-kiln</b> process for iron ore production; specifically, how waste heat contained in flue gas could be recirculated {{in order to achieve}} a decrease in specific fuel consumption. Consequently, fossil carbon emissions would be reduced as the <b>grate-kiln</b> units are fired with coal or oil. The implementation of flue gas recirculation is simulated with a process model in EBSILON Professional 10. 0. Process concepts which make use of available waste heat are developed and their impact on fuel usage, pellet temperature profiles and the magnetite oxidation process is evaluated. Aside from partial flue gas recirculation, a heat recovery concept is investigated. Both concepts are applied to decrease the fuel consumption by increasing the temperature and oxidation on the grate and to recover heat at a high temperature. To minimize the effect of recirculation and heat recovery on the pellet heat treatment process, concepts that use intercooling before the grate are also evaluated. The implementation of heat recovery affects the performance of the pellet cooler. The cooler’s operation is studied in detail with a cooler model developed in MATLAB. The cooler model is evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis is made to determine which parameters have a crucial impact on the pellet cooling. The results indicate that waste heat utilization can reduce the fuel consumption by up to 30 % if a heat exchanger is used. It was revealed that increased temperature into the cooler’s hottest section elevates the temperature levels on the grate, which lowers the fuel usage. Direct flue gas recirculation lowers the oxygen content in the air passing the kiln and grate, which has a negative impact on the oxidation process and the overall heat balance. The cooler model showed that to maintain adequate pellet cooling, the mass flow through cooler zones C 3 and C 4 should be increased by 70 %, or the area of the C 3 and C 4 sections should be increased by 40 % when heat recovery is used. The direct flue gas recirculation concepts requires a 40 % and 25 % increase for the two measures, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a thermodynamic model for the <b>Grate-Kiln</b> process. One application of such a process is the thermal treatment of iron ore pellets. The work has been performed in close collaboration with the iron ore producing company LKAB. The model is applied to assess the process in terms of heat and mass flows. The thermodynamic assessment is carried out on an overall basis and {{for each of the three}} main process parts: grate, kiln and cooler. The results reveal that the oxidation of the magnetite, contained in the inlet pellets, to hematite is the main heat source of the process. The heat release during the combustion of coal inside the kiln contributes to the remaining one third of the total heat supply. Half of the provided heat leaves the process as hot off gases. Thus, measures to improve the energy efficiency of the plant should focus on either reducing the mass flow of air that is heated by the process or making better use of the hot off gases. In order to shift the models usability towards quantitative application, different measures could be taken. Among these, improvements in the data for validation, and enhancements in the modelling of the chemical properties of the iron ore pellets promise the greatest benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} process {{applied in the}} <b>grate-kiln</b> process for iron ore pellet production employs air-to-fuel equivalence ratios {{in the range of}} 4 - 6, typically with coal as fuel and high-temperature air (> 1000 degrees C) as oxidant. The NOx emissions from these units are in general significantly higher than those in other combustion systems, and the large flows of flue gases make the implementation of secondary measures for NOx control costly. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate NOx. formation under combustion conditions relevant for iron ore production, in order to control the emissions from these units. The present work examines NO formation during the combustion of four pulverized coals, as well as during cofiring with biomass in a pilot-scale kiln (580 kWfuel) based on a two-week experimental campaign. The influence of burner settings was also included in the investigation. Based on the presented experimental results and the results of previous modeling and experimental studies, we suggest that the NOx emissions are mainly the result of a high conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen (fuel-N) to NO. In particular, char-bound nitrogen (char-N) conversion appears to be higher than in conventional pulverized fuel flames, presumably due to the high levels of oxygen present in the char-burnout region. The temperatures in the kiln varied between the test cases, but thermal NO formation is estimated to be of low importance...|$|E
40|$|LKAB {{is one of}} Sweden’s larger {{industrial}} {{companies and}} is, on the seaborne import market, the second largest supplier of iron ore pellets in the world. Mining and processing iron ore are energy intensive processes with considerable energy related emissions. The final heat treatment of the iron ore pellets, done in a straight-grate or <b>grate-kiln</b> furnace, is the most energy intensive part of the process. A collaboration between LKAB and the Division of Energy Technology at Chalmers aims to improve the energy efficiency of the heat treatment in the pelletizing plants. This thesis, {{as a part of}} that initiative, investigates the possibility to improve the energy efficiency of the straight-grate process. By modifications to a previously developed model for simulating the heat treatment in the straight-grate process, several design concepts are investigated in this work. The evaluation is based on performance indicators and process constraints with input data from the MK 3 unit in Malmberget. The most interesting concepts identified are optimized towards either production rate or fuel consumption, with a sustained product quality. The results indicates that a prolonged drying section is the most promising concept. An increase in production rate of 6 % is achieved with a reduced fuel consumption by 32 %. If the process is optimized solely for fuel economy a reduction of 50 % may be achieved.

40|$|LKAB is an {{international}} high-tech minerals group, one of the world's leading producers of upgraded iron ore products for the steel industry and a growing supplier of industrial minerals products to other sectors. Over the last years, the swedish industry has been facing increasing governmental pressure to control and reduce pollutant emissions, {{one of which is}} nitrogen oxides NOx. The pelletizing process requires high excess air levels and high temperatures, which promotes the production of NOx. Consequently, LKAB is running several research projects with the objective to reduce NOx emissions from the company's pellet production plants, including both primary and secondary measures. This work is part of an investigation whether Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is suitable for reducing NOx emissions in LKAB's <b>grate-kiln</b> iron ore pelletizing plant SK. The motivation of this specific research is to develop a CFD model that enhances the understanding of the aerodynamics and mixing of species inside the rotary kiln. At first, a parametric study of the pure airflow through the kiln is carried out and under certain conditions, a transient behaviour similar to that of vortex shedding is observed, with a strong dependence on momentum flux ratio between the secondary air jets. Further, the development of a preliminary coal combustion model is set out, which is in need of continued work in order to produce reliable predictions of various parameters relevant to the SNCR process. However, the effect of the combustion on the flow field is limited, indicating that the pure airflow model can be used to broadly investigate the influence of the secondary air flow.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to studypollution reduction in the manufacturing phase and heat transfer in the packed beds of iron ore pellets. CFD is a versatile tool that can be applied to study numerous problems in fluid mechanics. In the present thesis it is used, verified and validated to reveal the fluid mechanics of a couple of processes taking place during the drying and sintering of iron ore pellets. This is interesting in itself and can facilitate the optimization of the production as to product quality of the pellets, reduced energy consumption and reduction of emissions such as NOx and CO 2. The practical aim with the pollution reduction research project is to numerically study the use of Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technologies in gratekiln pelletizing plants for NOx reduction which had, to the best knowledge of the author, never been used in this context before despite that it is commonly used in cement and waste incineration plants. The investigation is done in several stages: 1) Reveal if it is possible to use the technique with the two most commonly reagents, ammonia and urea. 2) Derive a chemistry model for cyanuric acid (CA) so that this reagent also can be scrutinized. 3) Compare the reagents urea and CA in the gratekiln pelletizing process. A CFD model was developed and numerical simulations were carried out solving the flow field. A model for spray injection into the grate was then included in the model enabling a study of the overall mixing between the injected reagent droplets and the NOx polluted air. The results show that the SNCR technique with urea and CA may reduce the amount of NOx in the <b>grate-kiln</b> process under certain conditions while ammonia fails under the conditions investigated. The work also lays grounds for continued development of the proposed chemistry model by the adding of reactions to the RAPRENOx-process for CA as reagent, facilitating an extension to ammonia and urea as reagents. The <b>grate-kiln</b> plant consists of a grate, a rotating kiln and an annular cooler. The pellets are loaded onto the grate to shape a bed with a mean height of about 0. 2 m. The pellets in LKABs processes consist mainly of magnetite and different additives chosen to fit the demand from the customer. Throughout the grate a temperature gradient is formed in the bed. This gradient should be as even as possible throughout the grate to ensure an even quality of the pellets. Method to study this numerically is the second main task in this thesis. The aim is to find out how temperature distributions in the bed can be modeled and adjusted. Of special interest is how the incoming process gas, leakage, and the detailed composition of the pellet bed influence the heat transfer through the bed. To achieve the goals and create a trustful model for the heat transfer through the packed bed the model must be build up in steps. Heat transfer to a bed of iron ore pellets is therefore examined numerically on several scales and with three methods: a one-dimensional continuous model, a discrete three-dimensional model and traditional computational fluid dynamics. In a first study the convective heat transport in a relatively thin porous layer ofmonosized particles is set-up and computed with the one-dimensional continuous model and the discrete three-dimensional model. The size of the particles is only one order of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the layer. For the three-dimensional model the methodology applied is Voronoi discretization with minimization of dissipation rate of energy. The discrete model captures local effects, including low heat transfer in sections with low speed of the penetrating fluid and large velocity and temperature variations in a cross section of the bed. The discrete and continuousmodel compares well for low velocities for the studied uniform boundary conditions. When increasing the speed or for a thin porous layer however, the continuous model diverge from the discrete approach if a constant dispersion is used in the continuous approach. The influence is larger from an increase in pellet diameter to bed height ratio than from increased velocity. In a second study the discrete model is compared to simulations performed with CFD. If local values are of importance the discrete model should always be used but if mean predictions are sufficient the CFD model isan attractive alternative that is easy to couple to the physics up- and downstream the packed bed. The good agreement between the discrete and continuous model furthermore indicates that the discrete model may be used also for non-Stokian flow in the transitional region between laminar and turbulent flow, as turbulent effects show little influence of the overall heat transfer rates in the continuous model.

40|$|The rotary kilns used in {{the iron}} pellet {{production}} in the <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizing process of LKAB have two asymmetric secondary air channels to supply excessive air needed for combustion and the pellet sintering processes. As {{a consequence of the}} high flow rates and irregular-shaped secondary air channels, the aerodynamics in the kiln is strongly connected to the combustion and sintering performance. In this work a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study is performed with ANSYS CFX on the mixing between the primary burner jet and the asymmetric co-flows. This is done for a downscaled, simplified kiln model established in a previous experimental work. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (uRANS) equations are applied and three turbulence models are evaluated. Qualitatively, recirculation forms in the upper side of the kiln and behind the back plate for all turbulence models. It indicates a potential risk for a circulation of combustion products and a transport of them back toward the flame. No vortex shedding is found and it agrees with previous experiment. A comparison among turbulence models shows that the modified k-epsilon model yields a more physical and realistic flow field than a standard k-epsilon while the former underestimates the jet spreading. The result from Speziale-Sarkar-Garski Reynolds Stress Model (SSGRSM hereafter) illustrates different lateral development of the jet when compared to the k-e models. Quantitatively, the predictions of velocity decay and spreading rate of standard k-e model agree the best with experiment. The modified k-epsilon model predicts the smallest decay rates, corresponding to the longest jet seen in the instantaneous flow field. Results from the modified k-epsilon model are quite close to SSGRSM especially regarding the spreading rate. The simulations furthermore reveal that more experiments need to be carried out...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotary kiln}} process for iron ore {{pelletizing}} {{is one of}} the main methods to upgrade crude iron ore. The mining company LKAB runs four <b>Grate-Kiln</b> production sites in northern Sweden, where a grate and a rotary kiln are combined to thermally indurate the iron ore pellets. The high temperature needed for the process is provided by combustion of coal with a high amount of extremely preheated air, what creates an atmosphere inside the furnace of which the present theoretical understanding is low. So far, the high amount of excess air (λ = 5 - 6) made standard NOx mitigation strategies in the rotary kiln unsuitable. Environmental issues and need for fuel flexibility has enticed LKAB to carry out experimental campaigns in a test facility to characterize the combustion process. The results of the experimental campaign of 2013 and previous campaigns are reviewed in the present work. The measurement results were evaluated through gas-phase chemistry modelling with a detailed chemical reaction scheme. The evaluation of the 2013 experimental campaign suggests measurement problems of the temperature and the combustion behaviour inside the test furnace. Gas and oil flames showed to combust almost instantaneously within the first centimetres after the burner. Biomass and coal combusted significantly slower, but also had the highest reaction intensity close to the burner inlet. Measured exhaust NOx levels could not be achieved in the model with the measured temperature and modelling results proposed peak temperatures more than 500 °C above the measured temperature inside the kiln for oil and gas combustion. For oil and gas it was found that thermal-NOx is the major contributor to the NOx formation inside the pilot scale kiln. The lower NOx emissions for coal and biomass were explained by lower temperatures inside the kiln and the relation fuel-N and thermal-N. Modelling fuel bound nitrogen for the solid fuels showed that the NOx is formed there in similar amounts via both the fuel-NO and thermal-NO formation route. By comparing the high NOx levels of the experimental to the lower levels in the full scale plant, it was concluded that the NOx formation differs between them, as in the experimental one significantly higher temperature prevail for all fuels. This showed that this facility does not resemble the actual kiln adequately...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{different}} degradation mechanisms of the stainless steel in a travelling grate in a <b>Grate-Kiln</b> iron ore pellet indurator. The travelling grate is a conveyor belt that transports green-body pellets to a rotary kiln while the pellets are being dried and pre-heated to a temperature of 900 - 1100 °C by recycled hot air. After unloading of the pellets to the rotary-kiln for further sintering, the travelling grate is cooled in room temperature while returning to the loading zone of the wet pellets. The steel was tested during thermal cycling in a test-rig, in order to simulate the influence of thermo mechanical fatigue and oxide spallation. The influence of erosion-deposition was investigated in a modified horizontal industrial combustion kiln at 800 °C, with slag and coal from production used as erosive media and combustion fuel, respectively. The influence of minor alloying additions of Mn, Si and Ti on the microstructure was explored by eight different casted alloy compositions. Isothermal heat treatments were performed at 800 °C during 200 hours on steel immersed in deposits recovered from a travelling grate in production. The three main degradation mechanisms found in this work are thermal spallation, erosion-deposition and deposit induced accelerated corrosion (DIAC). Thermal spallation of the oxide layer {{is caused by the}} thermal expansion difference between the oxide and the metal during heating and cooling. It has been found that Ti improves the spallation resistance while Si reduces it. Spallation of deposits is another cause believed to increase the degradation. Erosion-deposition appears due to simultaneous erosion and deposition of particles on the travelling grate that causes erosion or deposition depending on the amount of alkali metals in the environment. The velocity of the particles also influences erosion and deposition in the way that higher velocities increase erosion. DIAC is proposed to form on the travelling grate due to the concentration of chloride- and sulphate containing alkali metals in the deposits.  Other than these major degrading mechanisms, minor degradation mechanisms such as internal oxidation, sigma formation, carburization and sensitization towards inter-granular attack have been found inside the steel during heating. Thermo mechanical fatigue (TMF) causes intergranular cracks in the material of the travelling grate. Casting issues such as micro-segregation have also been addressed in this thesis. A few different ways to improve degradation resistance have been proposed, such as homogenization heat treatments, optimization of process parameters and inhibitor solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of {{iron ore pellets}} is often performed in the so-called <b>Grate-Kiln</b> process. The aim of the process is to oxidize the magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) to hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and to sinter the pellets {{so they can be}} used in steel manufacturing. The heat required for this is produced by combusting a pulverized fuel in a rotary kiln, forming a suspension flame. Due to the need to oxidize the pellets, large amounts of air are introduced to the kiln. Relating the amount of air to the fuel, an air-to-fuel equivalence ratio of 4 - 6 is obtained. Furthermore, the air is pre-heated to above 1000 °C. High temperatures and large amounts of excess air are known to promote NOx formation and NOx emissions from iron ore processing plants are in general high. The aim of this work is to describe the NO formation in the rotary kiln and to identify governing parameters that may be altered to reduce the emissions. The thesis contains results from experiments in a pilot-scale kiln and from modeling work based on the same experiments. In the experiments, four coals were tested as well as co-firing coal with biomass. In-flame measurements of temperature and gas concentrations were performed {{with the use of a}} suction pyrometer and FTIR spectroscopy (+paramagnetism). Different primary measures for NOx reduction were also tested. Overall, reducing the primary air flow in the burner and co-firing coal with biomass were the most effective measures for reducing NOx emissions, compared to the reference case. Using natural gas and oil resulted in three times the amount of NOx. Reducing the total amount of excess air only resulted in a small NOx reduction, and increasing the secondary air temperature resulted in slightly decreased NOx formation. The general assumption in rotary kilns is that NOx is mostly formed by the thermal NO mechanism due to the high temperatures involved. Although this is certainly true for the cases with gas and oil, the experimental results indicate that NOx formed from the fuel-bound nitrogen is dominating the total NOx formation when solid fuels are used. The results from the detailed reaction modeling show that the thermal NO formation is of minor importance. Instead, the reduction of NO by char appears to be remarkably low in the kiln and responsible for the high net conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen to NO...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources that can be found in the lithosphere; 90 % of all metal ores extracted are iron ore. Many steps are included in the extraction from iron ore to metallic iron, where the processes vary between different producers. Iron ore pellets, are a prepared burden material for ironmaking in the blast furnace. Such pellets are commonly sintered in a <b>grate-kiln</b> furnace system, where the kiln usually is insulated with mullite containing bricks. Different mechanisms wear these bricks and they need to be replaced regularly and this causes production stops. The slag present in the kiln consists of ~ 95 % hematite, alkali-, alkaline earth- and other oxides, mainly from pellets that have disintegrated and adheres in chunks on the bricks. This study is focusing on the interaction between refractories and slags that occurs in kilns during the sintering process in the iron ore pellet production. Results are shown from lab scale experiments, and from samples collected in industrial furnaces, commonly called rotary kilns. Slag/brick compatibility tests were performed in a laboratory furnace at various temperatures, holding times and atmospheres. Slag collected from a production kiln and three commercial bricks, in powder or solid form, were used. Deliberate additions of alkali species were included in order to evaluate their influence. XRD, DSC, TG and in-situ mass spectrometry confirm that addition of alkali dissolves the mullite in the bricks, and forms the phase nepheline (Na 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 2 SiO 2), which disintegrate to an amorphous phase at elevated temperature. QEMSCAN were used to view mineralogical mappings of different chemical phases by field image scans. It was found that when alkali penetrates the surface of the brick, besides formation of nepheline, phases as kalsilite (K 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 2 SiO 2), leucite (K 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 4 SiO 2) and potassium â-alumina (K 2 O• 11 Al 2 O 3) are formed. Also seen is that potassium penetrates deeper, and in larger amounts than sodium in the lining material. Formations of alkali containing phases as the feldspathoid minerals kalsilite and nepheline are coupled to an expansion in the lining material, observed by dilatometry, causing structural spalling observed as cracks in some of the slag/brick compatibility tests. Grains of hematite with sizes between 50 - 100 ìm stay on the original surface of the brick, while micrometer sized hematite migrates through the dissolved brick by capillary infiltration and diffusion, and nucleates in needle formations deeper in the lining material. We propose a wear mechanism of the bricks in an iron ore pellet producing kiln that involves these chemical reactions in combination with erosion by the continuously flowing slag.

40|$|The {{pelletizing}} {{process where}} the crude ore from the mine is upgraded to pellets {{is a process}} which includes several stages involving complex fluid dynamics. In this thesis, {{focus is on the}} <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizing process and especially on the rotary kiln, with the objective to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} aerodynamics and its influence on the combustion process. The aim is to discover flow features taking place in the kiln, and the kiln hood, by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on simplified models of the real kiln, and to validate the set-ups of the numerical model with physical experiments using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). By starting as simple as possible, studying only the cold flow field without combustion and validating the simulations, a foundation for future geometrical optimizations can be achieved. Later on more realistic geometries may be studied with the validated simulations as a base. In Paper A the initial down-scaled, simplified model of the real kiln is studied, and both numerical and experimental analyses of the flow field are performed. Paper B focuses on the turbulent secondary flow that arises in ducts with non-circular cross-section. One of the inlet ducts to the kiln of interest here is close to semi-circular in cross section, hence the focus of this work. Numerical and experimental results are reported. Paper C is a development of the model, where instead of parallel inlet ducts as in Paper A, the top one has an inclination angle to the kiln axis. A thorough experimental analysis of the flow field is performed in this case. Conclusions are that steady state simulations can be used to get an overview over the main features of the flow field. Precautions should though be taken when analyzing the recirculation zone which is important for the flame stabilization. A stable flame is safe and crucial for efficient combustion. Steady state simulations do not capture the transient, oscillating behavior of the flow seen in the physical experiment. These oscillations will under certain conditions considerably affect the size of the recirculation zone. Another parameter affecting the size of the recirculation zone is the inclination of the upper inlet duct, where a decrease in recirculation length is seen although the actual inclination of the incoming jet is only about 3 - 4 º. The choice of turbulence model affects the prediction of turbulent secondary flow. If this flow feature needs to be revealed, a more advanced turbulence model should be used.

40|$|In an {{iron ore}} {{pelletizing}} plant, crude ore is upgraded to pellets {{to be used}} as feedstock in steel-making plants. As part of a <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizing plant, the rotary kiln is an indurating furnace in which the pellets are sintered. The rotary kiln involves complex flow of large amounts of gas and the process is strongly coupled to the fluid dynamics, which is not well understood. The present work focuses on increasing the understanding of the aerodynamics of the rotary kiln. Though the kiln geometry is relatively simple a rather complex flow arises, which is known to occur for turbulent flows in similar geometries. In order to isolate the underlying flow mechanisms, simplified models of the kiln are studied both numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The understanding of the flow phenomena that arises for the simplified models is essential for maintaining a solid comprehension of the fluid dynamics when increasing the complexity of the models. Computations are validated against available experimental data to evaluate the capability of the numerical procedure in capturing the underlying physics of the flow. In this way, the reliability of the predictions is improved when increasing the complexity of the model. In Paper A the unsteady non-reacting flow is computed and a preliminary coal combustion model is proposed, which is in need of further development to yield reliable predictions of the reacting flow. Paper B is an experimental investigation of a down-scaled model of the kiln and also an extension to previous experimental work by introducing an inclination of the upper inlet duct to the kiln and carrying out a more thorough analysis of the fluid dynamics. In Paper C, the periodic flow observed in Paper A is investigated further using a more sophisticated turbulence closure and carefully validating the predictions against available experimental data. For the simplified models under investigation, it is concluded that the flow is dominated by the periodic shedding and downstream convection of von-Karman-like vortices originating in the free shear layers enclosing the recirculation zone formed in the inlet end of the kiln. Both numerical and experimental investigations show a strong dependence of momentum flux ratio between the two inlet ducts on the flow field. The large-scale periodic fluctuations, which are resolved in an unsteady computation but completely neglected in a steady computation, are seen to contribute significantly to the turbulent transport in the recirculation zone. This indicates the need for unsteady computations to accurately predict the transport processes. The recirculation zone is important for flame stabilization as it feeds back hot gas to the near-burner region. Hence, a challenging requirement of the numerical model is to accurately capture the physics of the recirculating flow. The use of a second-moment turbulence closure is shown to significantly improve the predictions over the use of an eddyviscosity turbulence model and give promising results for further work on more complex models of the kiln.

Many steps are included in the extraction of iron from ore, with extraction processes varying among different producers. Iron ore pellets are a prepared burden material for ironmaking in the blast furnace or by direct reduction. Such pellets can be sintered in a <b>grate-kiln</b> furnace system, in which the kiln is usually lined with mullite-containing bricks. These bricks degrade by various mechanisms, and need to be replaced regularly, which causes expensive production stops. Materials deposit in chunks on the lining in the kiln. These deposits comprise ~ 95 % hematite with oxides of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and others, which originate mainly from pellets that have disintegrated, but also from fly-ash from the burner fuel used to heat the kiln. This study investigated the interaction of deposit materials with refractory lining bricks in kilns during the sintering process in iron ore pellet production. Results are obtained from laboratory scale experiments, and from samples collected from industrial kilns, both in-situ and during production stops. Refractory/deposit compatibility tests were performed in a laboratory furnace at various temperatures, for different holding times, and in a number of atmospheres. Deposit materials collected from three commercial lining bricks in production kilns were analysed in both powder and solid forms. Deliberate additions of alkali species (carbonates of potassium and sodium) were made in order to evaluate their influence on degradation mechanisms. Analysis using scanning electron microscopy, QEMSCAN (quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy), x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and in-situ mass spectrometry confirmed that alkali additions in the deposit materials dissolve mullite in the liner bricks, which accelerates degradation. Phases such as nepheline (Na 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), kalsilite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), leucite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 4 SiO 2) and potassium β-alumina (K 2 O· 11 Al 2 O 3) were formed. Moreover, it was observed that potassium penetrates deeper into the lining material, and in larger amounts, than sodium, both on the laboratory scale and in industrial furnaces. Formations of alkalicontaining phases such as the feldspathoid minerals kalsilite and nepheline are coupled with an expansion in the lining material, observed by dilatometry, which causes structural spalling that appears as cracks in some of the refractory/deposit compatibility tests. Grains of hematite with sizes between 50 - 100 μm remain on the original surface of the brick, whereas micrometer-scale hematite migrates through capillary infiltration (in pores, brick joints and cracks) and diffusion, and appears in finer grains deeper in the lining material. The degradation mechanisms of the bricks in an iron ore pellet producing kiln are shown to involve these chemical reactions in combination with thermomechanical stresses. Recommendations are given regarding the choice of materials, the design of refractory liners in the kilns to extend the time between production stops necessary for repair.

40|$|Rotary kilns are {{industrial}} furnaces {{that have}} been widely used in limestone calcination, cement industry and hazardous waste incineration for centuries. In this work a rotary kiln used for the iron ore pellet sintering process in the <b>grate-kiln</b> pelletizing system has been studied. In order to increase the energy efficiency, a large amount of air is supplied to the kiln through air channels connected to the cooler. This air is necessary for the coal combustion process and the heat transport to the kiln bed. However, the geometry of the kiln hood connecting the air channels and the cooler is complicated. As a consequence, the jet flame is unstable. In order to improve the performance of the jet flame it is therefore necessary to study the kiln aerodynamics to reveal the flow field. Even though it is a complicated problem containing fluid dynamics, combustion and heat and mass transfer, it can be simplified into a down-scaled cold model to make it feasible to understand the flow field both experimentally and numerically. In this work, the whole kiln is generalized as a high Reynolds number turbulent round jet interacting with asymmetric co-flows. With the aid from previous PIV measurement data of a down-scaled water model of the kiln, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using the commercial code ANSYS CFX 16. 0 have been pursued for two main purposes: 1) To find a turbulence model that is computationally inexpensive and able to capture the main features of the mean flow field; 2) With the turbulence model chosen in 1), to study the geometrical effect {{on the development of the}} primary jet. In Paper A, three turbulence models were employed, the standard k-epsilon model, a modified k-epsilon model with slightly higher turbulence production and the SSG Reynolds stress model. Wall functions were applied since resolving the viscous wall region was not a concern in this work. It is found that the standard k-epsilon model fit the experimental data best compared to the other two models and that all three turbulence models predict an asymmetric development of the primary jet, especially far downstream, In Paper B, again using the down-scaled kiln model, isothermal cases with four different nozzle diameters were simulated with the standard k-epsilon model. The aim is to investigate the effect of initial Reynolds number on the jet development in asymmetric co-flows from the air channels. It is found that, with increasing Reynolds number, the jet becomes shorter and the mixing between the primary jet and surrounding flow is better. A low-velocity region or external recirculation zone (ERZ) form near the kiln upper wall and shrink with increased nozzle diameter or decreased initial Reynolds number. The ERZ may stabilize the flame since it is a low-velocity region and consequently attract the jet to reside predominantly in it or in the shear layer. As a conclusion, by enlarging the jet exit diameter, the jet can be prolonged, while to a certain extent, the benefit from the ERZ would need to be sacrificed. Since the asymmetric development and the ERZ in the kiln were not studied during the previous PIV measurement campaign, more experimental studies are planned to provide more experimental evidences of the details of the flow and to lay grounds for validation of the CFD simulation results...|$|E
40|$|The project {{which is}} {{presented}} in this report {{is focused on the}} positioning of the support rollers connected to the Kiln in one of the pelletizing plants in Kiruna at LKAB. Kiln is a rotating oven where the pellets are sintered, {{which is one of the}} steps in the pelletizing process. The support rollers are used to position Kiln in an axial or vertical direction, by either skewing the rollers or positioning the whole center of the rollers towards or away from the Kiln. The plan for this project is to be used as a preparatory work for a construction of an atomized system for adjustment of the support rollers for Kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. An atomized adjustment system can possibly simplify the procedure of Kiln positioning, increase the lifespan of the system and increase the reliability of the whole system. This report can also lead to improvements by being used as a support during positioning of support rollers. A support system for Kiln positioning can contribute to avoid production disturbances. Product disturbances can occur because of damaged components such as damaged support wheels or parts of the Kiln driveline. Less production disturbances increases the availability of the <b>Grate-Kiln</b> plant and thereby increases the profitability for LKAB. The aim of this project has been to develop a calculation model which can show the reactions of Kiln when the support rollers are adjusted. The assignment was also to include the heating and cooling of Kiln and to have considerations regarding the gear contact in the driveline. One part of the assignment was also to document the damages that can occur because of inaccurate positioning of the support rollers. The final step in this project was to propose optimized positions for the support rollers. This project is the final assignment before examination from the M. Sc Student in Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Technology in Luleå LTU in Sweden. The main part of this project has been to develop a calculation model. The calculation model is built in a Matlab script. In this Matlab script there are essentially six parts of the script that can be varied, and these parts are:- The temperatures in the system- The dimensions of components- The load, with or without pellets- The positioning of the pellets in the Kiln - The skewing of the support rollers- The positioning of the center of the support rollersWhen these parameters are varied a result for over 170 parameters can be collected. The calculation model is mainly focused on how the forces in the system reacts when the support rollers are adjusted and also how the Kiln reacts to thermal expansion and contraction. It is essentially the center positioning of the support rollers which is analyzed. The calculations of the forces which occur because of the skewing of the support rollers was too complicated and time consuming to be able to be finished during this project. The calculations regarding the skewing of the support rollers has been started and future work has been recommended. The calculation model, which is one of the results of this project has been used to analyze the reactions from positioning the support rollers. By examine how great the height differences are for the Kiln, a maximum center positioning of the support rollers has been recommended. This recommended maximum positioning is to protect any damages to the gear contact in the drive line. The thermal effects does not have a major impact on the forces in the system. Height differences that occur during heating and cooling of the Kiln has been noted up to about 9 mm. There is no great impact on the forces in the system during the interval which the support rollers can be adjusted without exceeding the maximum height differences. A validation of the results in this report is planned to be performed during the summer 2015. Validerat; 20150615 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
