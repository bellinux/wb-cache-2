30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any floor finishing material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and <b>finishing</b> <b>mortar.</b> Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor finishing material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|E

40|$|Apartment {{buildings}} in Korea have adopted underfloor heating systems using web construction methods based on concrete and hot water systems. However, since such systems consume {{significant amounts of}} energy for heating owing to their low thermal storage performance, {{it is necessary to}} develop a new system that can minimize energy consumption by improving concrete thermal storage performance. This study proposes a phase-change material (PCM) underfloor heating system to reduce energy consumption in apartment buildings. An optimal design for a PCM underfloor heating system is proposed, and thermal storage performance of the proposed system is evaluated experimentally. The temperature range of the PCM for underfloor heating is also calculated considering the proposed design and comfortable heating conditions for domestic apartment buildings. Results indicate that a PCM underfloor heating system can be constructed in the following order: (1) a 210 mm concrete slab, (2) a 20 mm cushioning material, (3) 40 [*]mm of mortar including a 10 mm PCM thermal storage container, and (4) 40 [*]mm of <b>finishing</b> <b>mortar</b> including wire mesh and hot water pipes. The temperature range of the PCM used for underfloor heating in domestic apartment buildings is 32 – 45 °C. Experimental tests reveal that thermal storage performance of underfloor heating systems that apply 35, 37, 41, and 44 °C as representative PCM temperatures is superior to existing systems...|$|E

Though the regulatory documents don’t specify the dependence of plaster density from the density grade of gas-concrete blocks. In case of facing of gas-concrete blocks with the grade D 500 using plaster mortars with the density 1400 … 1600 km/m 3 there occurs a dismatch in the values of thermal insulation and vapor permeability of the plaster and base. The authors suggest using dry <b>mortars</b> for <b>finishing</b> of gas-concrete block of the grades D 500 и D 600, which allow obtaining facing thermal insulating coatings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} in its entirety, i. e. {{this publication}} {{prepared for a}} doctorate and now presented together with the licentiate thesis from 2004, deals with the production and utilisation of hydraulic lime mortar, including natural cement and pozzolana mortar, in historic buildings in the Nordic countries, especially in Sweden, from the Middle Ages until present time. The disseratation covers a field of knowledge where the collected knowledge still is meagre. There was a historic stage in a general endeavour to produce mortar with hydraulic characteristics, which also {{led to the development}} of Portland cement. The author is of the opinion that such an endeavour has existed for a long period; in Sweden at least since the 18 th century. This is investigated with and supported by a survey of the production and utilisation of hydraulic lime mortar and also natural cement and pozzolana mortar through the course of time. Two investigations are included in the licentiate thesis. The first deals with the situation concerning knowledge and research with regard to the production and utilisation of hydraulic lime, hydraulic lime mortar, natural cement and pozzolana mortar from a historical perspective. The second deals with the occurrence and deposits of limestone that has been possible to utilise for the production of natural hydraulic lime; and similarly the raw materials for production of natural cement and pozzolana mortar, for instance brick for brickdust lime mortar and burned alum shale for alum shale lime mortar. The production of lime and other materials is linked in this dissertation to still existing buildings and constructions. This study includes a detailed presentation of composition, material properties and also production. This is achieved by four sub-surveys covering four types of mortar: (1) natural hydraulic and sub-hydraulic lime mortar, (2) natural cement, (3) brickdust lime mortar and (4) alum shale lime mortar. The intention is to characterise and illustrate by the four sub-studies investigations for what purposes these materials have been used, i. e. in what objects, with application as mortar, grout and <b>finishing</b> <b>mortar,</b> or in the manufacturing of façade ornaments for example. Natural hydraulic and sub-hydraulic lime mortar was in use already during the Middle Ages. However, the conditions dealt with in this dissertation refer mainly to the latter part of the 17 th century and the 18 th, 19 th and 20 th centuries. In contrast natural cement was in use during the 19 th century only. The investigations included in this doctoral dissertation are based on own and other available building-archaeological investigations and observations and also mortar studies. The building investigations were made in connection with restoration projects and façade restoration. The mortar investigations consist of quantitative and qualitative microscopic analyses of thin section as well as chemical analyses and to some extent also SEM/EDS and XRD analyses. The large number of thin section analyses and chemical analyses, and the large number of analysed components, is unique for the investigations of hydraulic lime mortar in Sweden. The analyses thus provide completely new information regarding these kinds of mortars. This study demonstrates that hydraulic lime mortar is a traditional building material that has had an essential role in buildings in Sweden from the Middle Ages to present time. A lot of lime mortars from before the 17 th century are sub-hydraulic according to this investigations. During second half of the 17 th century the knowledge about hydraulic mortar was developed. At that time could the hydraulic effect rise and 1770 the swedish cement, the alum shale mortar, was devised.

To reduce the rate of carbonation, the surface coatings, such as <b>mortar</b> <b>finish,</b> has been used widely to concrete. This paper presents a numerical procedure about carbonation of the coating-concrete system. This numerical procedure starts with a multi-component hydration model. By hydration model which considers both and Portland cement and pozzolanic reaction, the amount of hydration products which are susceptible to carbonate as well as porosity is obtained as function of age. Furthermore, the diffusivity of CO 2 is determined and carbonation depth of concrete is predicted.

40|$|As {{sustainability}} {{moves to}} the forefront of construction, the utilization of high volume fly ash concrete mixtures to reduce CO 2 emissions and cement consumption per unit volume of concrete placed is receiving renewed interest. Concrete mixtures in which the fly ash replaces 50 % or more of the portland cement are both economically and technically viable. This paper focuses on a characterization of the thermal properties, namely heat capacity and thermal conductivity, of such mixtures. Both the raw materials and the <b>finished</b> products (<b>mortars</b> and concretes) are evaluated using a transient plane source method. Because the specimens being examined are well hydrated, estimates of the heat capacity based on a law of mixtures with a “bound water ” heat capacity value employed for the water in the mixture provide reasonable predictions of the measured performance. As with most materials, thermal conductivity is found to be a function of density, while also being dependent on whether the aggregate source is siliceous or limestone. The measured values should provide a useful database for evaluating the thermal performance of high volume fly ash concrete structures...|$|R

40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been a lot of {{discussion}} about negative impacts on the environment that are caused by human actions. Climate change, ozone hole, global warming, air pollution are only some of the many negative impacts. In addition, non-renewable energy resources (such as oil, natural gas, coal) are being depleted, causing energy to increasingly become more and more valuable. One of the methods for detection of such negative environmental impacts is the socalled life cycle assessment method or LCA. First part of the master thesis presents the LCA method and with it connected standardization, its characteristics, process and its use in construction industry. It continues with the presentation of the ETICS and its components. The LCA calculation (“from cradle to gate”) using real data and the presentation of the results in form of the environmental product declaration EPD, is carried out for adhesive <b>mortar,</b> <b>finishing</b> coat and ETICS. Last part of this thesis presents the comparison of the environmental impacts on thermal insulation materials, finishing coats and ETICS. We compared the thermal insulation materials according to the LCA results that were calculated from the databases. For comparison of the finishing coats we used publicly available EPD and the finishing coat we calculated ourselves. Lastly we combined different thermal insulation materials and finishing coats into ETICS, calculated LCA and compared the ETICS. We have found that the only right comparison including declared unit is the one that is based on the function of the material and not on the mass unit of the material. The results vary according to different environmental impact indicators, therefore it is necessary to compare different indicators among themselves. Using LCA we came to a conclusion that the thermal insulation material has the biggest impact on the ETICS in majority of the environmental impact indicators, while the choice of finishing coat does not play a key role for environmental impact indicators...|$|R
