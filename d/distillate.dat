5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} {{makes it easy to}} bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and <b>distillate</b> making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the <b>distillate</b> product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid <b>distillate</b> phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam <b>distillate</b> of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E

50|$|Cosmetics and {{toiletries}} {{makers are}} finding many uses for herbal <b>distillates.</b> <b>Distillates</b> {{are also used}} as flavorings and curables.|$|R
50|$|Most {{refineries}} therefore add {{vacuum distillation}} and catalytic cracking, which adds one more level of complexity by reducing fuel oil by conversion to light <b>distillates</b> and middle <b>distillates.</b> A coking refinery adds further complexity to the cracking refinery by high conversion of fuel oil into <b>distillates</b> and petroleum coke.|$|R
5|$|The tansy plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, tansy is a repellent to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam <b>distillate</b> of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|The Sarawak Shell Bintulu Plant (SSBP), {{formerly}} known as Bintulu Crude Oil Terminal (BCOT), was established in 1979. It consists of three crude oil storage tanks, each with a capacity of 410,000 barrels. It has three major areas of operation: Crude Oil Operations, Condensate Stabilisation, and Gas Sales Facilities. Royal Dutch Shell started to establish the world's first Shell Middle <b>Distillate</b> Synthesis plant (Shell MDS) in 1993. It {{is also known as}} Bintulu Gas-To-Liquid plant (Bintulu GTL). The plant has a production capacity of 14,770 barrels per day with a total investment of over US$1billion as of the year 2010. The plant is staffed with 380 people, of whom 93% are Malaysians, with 80% of the staff coming from Sarawak.|$|E
25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the <b>distillate</b> at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the <b>distillate</b> would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the <b>distillate</b> moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the <b>distillate</b> or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} of quality young wine <b>distillates</b> production have been examined. The base wine was produced from Vitis vinifera L. quantitatively dominating grape varieties {{within the group}} of the recommended and permitted varieties of Kutjevo vineyards, located {{in the eastern part}} of the continental Croatia. Characterisation of wine and <b>distillates</b> was based on chemical and instrumental methods and on their sensory evaluation. Volatile compounds were analysed and identified by GC-FID and GC-MS. The wine varieties Rhine Riesling, Müller Thurgau and Riesling have the potential for the production of quality <b>distillates,</b> suitable for maturation. Pinot White, Traminer and Chardonnay give more acceptable wines than <b>distillates</b> and it is therefore not advisable to use them for <b>distillates</b> production, while the varieties Pinot Gris, Frankovka and Steinschiller are not suitable for the production of <b>distillates.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Petroleum {{products}} are usually grouped into four categories: light <b>distillates</b> (LPG, gasoline, naphtha), middle <b>distillates</b> (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel), heavy <b>distillates</b> and residuum (heavy fuel oil, lubricating oils, wax, asphalt). This classification {{is based on}} the way crude oil is distilled and separated into fractions (called [...] and [...] ) as in the above drawing.|$|R
25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a positive azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the <b>distillate</b> being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the starting mixture. For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the <b>distillate</b> will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the azeotropic mixture than the original. Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a <b>distillate</b> that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a <b>distillate</b> that exceeds the azeotropic ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope, the <b>distillate</b> (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but slightly richer than the azeotrope. This means the solution left behind will be richer in ethanol.|$|E
25|$|When the {{solution}} is boiled at point E, the <b>distillate</b> is poorer in X than the residue at point E. This means that the residue is richer in X than the <b>distillate</b> at point E. Indeed, progressive distillation can produce a residue as rich in X as is required.|$|E
25|$|The {{distillation}} of absinthe first {{yields a}} colourless <b>distillate</b> {{that leaves the}} alembic at around 72% ABV.

40|$|Six wines were {{distilled}} in {{two different}} distillation apparatus (alembic and column) producing 24 <b>distillates</b> (6 for each alembic fraction - head, heart and tail; 6 column <b>distillates).</b> The chemical composition of <b>distillates</b> from the same wine was determined using chromatographic techniques. Analytical data were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) allowing discrimination of four clusters according to chemical profiles. Both distillation processes influenced the sugarcane spirits chemical quality since two types of <b>distillates</b> with different quantitative chemical profiles were produced after the elimination of fermentation step influence...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the composition of secondary aroma compounds of fresh grape marc <b>distillates</b> {{as a result of}} variety and production technology, 30 samples (6 varieties× 5 samples) were analysed. White grape marc samples from Malvazija istarska, Chardonnay and Muscat Blanc were obtained as by-products in standard white wine production, while red grape marc samples from Teran and Cabernet Sauvignon were obtained after standard red wine production procedures. Marc from red grape variety Muškat ruža porečki was obtained during the production of rosé wines. All fermented marc samples were distilled using a traditional copper alembic. The obtained <b>distillates</b> were subjected to GC/MS and GC/FID analyses. Malvazija istarska <b>distillates</b> exhibited exceptionally high methanol content. <b>Distillates</b> from white grape varieties were found to be characterized by higher C 6 alcohol and 1 -propanol concentrations, while red grape <b>distillates</b> contained higher amounts of the majority of alcohols, acids, and esters. In Muškat ruža <b>distillates</b> intermediate concentrations of many important aroma compounds were found. It was concluded that differences in the production technology parameters, depending on the variety, resulted in differences in secondary aroma profiles, most evident between <b>distillates</b> from white and red varieties. These findings were confirmed applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA), which resulted in 100 % correct classification of <b>distillates</b> according to the variety and corresponding production technology...|$|R
25|$|A quick {{estimate}} of the alcoholic strength, or proof, of the <b>distillate</b> (the ratio of alcohol to water) is often achieved by shaking a clear container of the <b>distillate.</b> Large bubbles with a short duration indicate a higher alcohol content, while smaller bubbles that disappear more slowly indicate lower alcohol content.|$|E

25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the <b>distillate</b> travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the <b>distillate</b> travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the <b>distillate</b> only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect <b>distillate</b> fractions.|$|E
40|$|Background: Herbal <b>distillates</b> {{have been}} used for many centuries as drinks, flavors, and herbal {{medicine}} in Iran, especially in the city of Urmia. Recently, some studies claimed the presence of methanol in different types of herbal <b>distillates.</b> Methanol is a highly toxic compound which can cause acute or chronic toxicity in humans. Acute poisoning with methanol can cause different complications and even death while chronic methanol exposure has a wide range of nonspecific and misleading findings. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine methanol content in the commonly-used industrial herbal <b>distillates</b> produced in Urmia. Methods: Five samples of six types of most commonly used herbal <b>distillates</b> (peppermint, musk willow, lemon balm, pennyroyal, dill, and rose water) were purchased from five active herbal <b>distillates</b> manufacturers in Urmia. All samples were transferred to the laboratory and methanol content of each sample was measured two times according to the standard method of analysis using spectrophotometer. Results: The lowest and highest concentration of methanol were found in rose water (mean= 72. 4 ± 32. 1 ppm) and musk willow (mean= 278. 3 ± 106 ppm) samples, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences among methanol concentrations in the studied herbal <b>distillates</b> (F= 60. 9, P < 0. 001). Discussion: Different amounts of methanol were found in herbal <b>distillates</b> and it seems that there are statistically significant differences in methanol concentrations of various types of herbal <b>distillates.</b> Therefore, considering the harmful effects of methanol on human health, further studies are required for determining permitted levels of methanol in herbal <b>distillates.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|FTIR {{analysis}} {{confirmed the}} presence of carbonyl functional groups in the <b>distillates</b> of pyrolitic oil of RSO. The characteristic vibration modes of aliphatic C–H stretching and C=O stretching could be identified in all four <b>distillates</b> at 2850 – 2980  cm− 1 and around 1710  cm− 1 respectively. The characteristic stretching vibration of carboxylic –OH was observed as a very broad band in all four spectra extending from 2400 to 3400  cm− 1 indicating {{the presence of}} carboxylic acids. The broadness of this peak {{was found to be}} more significant when the <b>distillates</b> were within the high temperature range. Thus, the acidity must have increased with the distillation temperature and this confirms the increase of the acid value of <b>distillates</b> in the high temperature range. Also, the peaks around 1000 – 1300  cm− 1 confirm the presence of ester compounds in all four fractions. The characteristic olefinic C=C stretching was observed in all the <b>distillates</b> except D 4. This confirms that the availability of alkene content in D 4 was less compared to other <b>distillates.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{application}} of distillation can roughly be divided in four groups: laboratory scale, industrial distillation, distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals (herbal <b>distillate),</b> and food processing. The latter two are distinctively {{different from the}} former two in that in the processing of beverages and herbs, the distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all volatiles from the source materials to the <b>distillate.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{hypothetical}} azeotrope of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a <b>distillate</b> at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this <b>distillate</b> is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a <b>distillate</b> at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as C. If that <b>distillate</b> is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure azeotrope to A. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.|$|E
40|$|Acetaldehyde is a {{compound}} of aldehyde group that is very volatile and toxic. This compound {{can be found in}} fructose syrups used in carbonate beverages.

40|$|The aroma {{fraction}} of Italian <b>distillates</b> of wild (Pyrus amygidaliformis, Vill., namely ‘Pirastru’) and cultivated (Pyrus communis, L. cvs. ‘Coscia’, ‘Precoce di Fiorano’ and ‘Butirru de Austu’) pear varieties {{grown in the}} northern part of the island of Sardinia was investigated. <b>Distillates</b> from fermented mashes were obtained from the same producer and, in most cases, for 3 years following the same production process. Aroma analyses were performed by GC-FID and GC-MS techniques with direct GC injection of full proof <b>distillates.</b> Differences were found in the aromatic profile of all the <b>distillates</b> depending on their varietal origin. Wild Pirastru pear <b>distillates</b> were the richest in isoeugenol (0. 186 g hL - 1 a. a.), ethyl benzoate (0. 388 g hL - 1 a. a.) and ethyl phenylacetate (0. 12 g hL - 1 a. a.) but the poorest in 1 -hexanol (2. 69 g hL - 1 a. a.), n-hexyl acetate (0. 07 g hL - 1 a. a.), ∑-farnesene isomers (0. 80 g hL - 1 a. a.) and citronellol (0. 007 g hL - 1 a. a.). Pirastru <b>distillates</b> were also the poorest in methyl and ethyl unsaturated decanoate isomers, the socalled Williams pear esters (0. 002 g hL - 1 a. a.).
