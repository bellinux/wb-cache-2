500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>his</b> demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So I took it to Faith. Faith loved it, she said she'd been looking for Nas {{for a year and a}} half. They wouldn't let me leave the office without a deal on the table." ...|$|E
2500|$|Purim's mother, Rachel Vaisberg, is Brazilian-Jewish. Her father, Naum Purim (1912—1992), was a Romanian Jewish {{immigrant}} from Moghilău, then {{part of the}} Russian Empire. Her sister Yana Purim (Bernstein) is also a jazz singer. Purim is also {{the name of the}} annual Jewish festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jews from a plot to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. Hence Purim presumably has Jewish ancestry through her father. She also adheres to the Bahá'í Faith {{thanks in large part to}} Dizzy Gillespie. Gillespie's death in 1993 prompted Purim in 2002 to comment on his influence on her – [...] "…I loved him also because he gave me a lot of insight and spirituality, he even <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>his</b> praying book…" ...|$|E

We became very, very great friends, {{and all of his}} books - The Madman, The Forerunner, The Son of Man, The Prophet - I heard in manuscript. He always <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>his</b> books. I liked The Prophet best. I don't believe that there was any connection between `Abdu'l-Bahá and The Prophet. But {{he told me that he}} thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through. He said that he was going to write another book with '`Abdu'l-Bahá as the center and all the contemporaries of '`Abdu'l-Bahá speaking. He died before he wrote it. He told me definitely that [...] The Son of Man was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, as Israel and the Holy See {{had just}} {{established}} political relations, D'Or also received {{an invitation from}} the Vatican to perform for Pope John Paul II. His repertoire at this concert, which was broadcast worldwide and received enthusiastic reviews, united original ethnic music with European classics, and included a song D'Or composed specifically for the Pope in both Hebrew and Italian. He was the first Israeli singer to sing in Hebrew for the Pope. After he performed for the Pope ("He held my hand and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>his</b> blessing", D'Or said. [...] "I just kept thinking: 'Here I am, little David from Israel, singing in Hebrew...It was a very powerful thing.'"), D'Or was invited to perform in Italy, where he appeared on TV shows such as Maurizio Costanzo on Channel 1, and Paulo Limiti on Channel 2. The Italian press, such as Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, gave D'Or positive reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Evangelical {{organisation}} Andrew Wommack Ministries declared {{support for}} the bill. [...] "I knew this information was wrong and the punishments were vastly exaggerated as is so often the case. I met with the member of parliament responsible for this bill and he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>his</b> reasoning for introducing this legislation. Uganda had just had the United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation {{in order to obtain}} a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe). They responded with this legislation in order to stop the strong arm tactics of the pro-homosexual western influence. Would to God American leaders had enough integrity to not be bribed or badgered into compliance. Although I knew the situation was being misrepresented, I didn't feel qualified to deal with this personally. But Leland Shores who runs our office in Kampala, Uganda is well aware of the details and has written a response worthy of everyone who has an interest in this reading. He has included a letter from over 200 Ugandan Christian leaders explaining the situation." ...|$|E
