25|$|He said He {{was going}} to London to get Men but I soon found he was going there with his Steam Carg to shew it & {{to take out a}} patent. He having been told by Mr W. Wilkn what Sadler had said & he had {{likewise}} read in the news paper Simmingtons puff which had rekindled all Wms fire & impations to make Steam Carriages. However, I prevailed upon him readily to return to Cornwall by the next days diligence & he accordingly arivd here this day at noon, since which he hath unpacked his Carg & made Travil a Mile or two in Rivers's great room in a Circle making it carry the <b>fire</b> <b>Shovel,</b> poker & tongs.|$|E

6000|$|... "How can I {{carry that}} awful thing out?" [...] moaned Anne with a shudder. The <b>fire</b> <b>shovel</b> {{suggested}} itself {{to her and}} she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry. Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs, for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall. When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief.|$|E

50|$|Another tale, from Somerset, casts the Elder Mother as the villain, a witch that {{a farmer}} sees as an elder milking his cow. The farmer shoots at the witch {{with a silver}} bullet but misses and is chased back into the farmhouse. The old granny, however, picks up the burning coal from the <b>fire</b> with a <b>shovel</b> and throws it at the elder tree, burning cinders, and thus the witch is dead.|$|R
60|$|Matty, who was {{in truth}} an {{experienced}} maid-of-all-work, began with alacrity to discharge the duties of her new station. She carried off the ashes, and returned with the materials for next day's <b>fire</b> in a <b>shovel.</b> Here she gave a slight indication of her so-called carelessness (awkwardness {{would have been more}} appropriate) by letting two or three pieces of stick and a bit of coal fall on the carpet, in her passage across the room.|$|R
60|$|The {{only thing}} that bothered the Duke was {{borrowing}} money. This was necessary {{from time to time}} when loans or mortgages fell in, but he hated it. It was beneath him. His ancestors had often taken money, but had never borrowed it, and the Duke chafed under the necessity. There was something about the process that went against the grain. To sit down in pleasant converse with a man, perhaps almost a gentleman, and then lead up to the subject and take his money from him, seemed to the Duke's mind essentially low. He could have understood knocking a man over the head with a <b>fire</b> <b>shovel</b> and taking his money, but not borrowing it.|$|E
6000|$|The shock--the grasp--perhaps Abner's words, {{momentarily}} silenced Byers. [...] "Did I strike her?" [...] he said dazedly; [...] "did I abuse her? Oh, yes!" [...] {{with deep}} irony. [...] "Certainly! In course! Look yer, pardner!"--he suddenly dragged {{up his sleeve}} from his red, hairy arm, exposing a blue cicatrix in its centre--"that's a jab from her scissors about three months ago; look yer!"--he bent his head and showed a scar along the scalp--"that's her playfulness with a <b>fire</b> <b>shovel!</b> Look yer!"--he quickly opened his collar, where his neck and cheek were striped and crossed with adhesive plaster--"that's {{all that was left}} o' a glass jar o' preserves--the preserves got away, but some of the glass got stuck! That's when she heard I was a di-vorced man and hadn't told her." ...|$|E
50|$|As in {{any other}} small town, all is known by all, and the Browns' affairs shortly are no exception. While their {{economic}} distress is evident from day one, the townspeople soon discover something new: Captain Brown’s kindness. This is most notable in his treatment of his elder daughter, who has a debilitating illness (which contributes to her bad temper). Captain Brown and his younger daughter endure abject poverty in order to afford small luxuries to comfort the elder daughter. Captain Brown also shows his kindness by hand-crafting a wooden <b>fire</b> <b>shovel</b> for Miss Jenkyns, after overhearing her complaining about the weight and noisiness of her metal <b>fire</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
60|$|December 25.--Christmas Day! 'Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth, {{peace and}} {{goodwill}} towards men.' So no great shells were fired into the Boer entrenchments at dawn, and the hostile camps remained tranquil throughout the day. Even the pickets forbore to snipe each other, and both armies attended divine {{service in the}} morning and implored Heaven's blessing on their righteous causes. In the afternoon the British held athletic sports, an impromptu military tournament, and a gymkhana, all of which caused much merriment and diversion, and the Boers profited by the cessation of the shell <b>fire</b> to <b>shovel</b> away at their trenches. In the evening there were Christmas dinners in our camp--roast beef, plum pudding, a quart of beer for everyone, and various smoking concerts afterwards. I cannot describe the enemy's festivities.|$|R
50|$|A {{little after}} 2 p.m., {{a small fire}} broke out {{in a pile of}} debris, in Mineral Wells Canyon. Many of the workers volunteered or were ordered to fight the fire, but it spread up the canyon. Since there was no piped water in the area, the men tried to beat out the <b>fire</b> with <b>shovels.</b> Foremen with no {{knowledge}} of firefighting initially directed the effort, setting inappropriate back fires and sending hundreds of workers into a steep canyon. The fire department arrived at 2:26 p.m. but found it hard to fight the fire, {{because of the presence of}} thousands of untrained people. When the wind changed direction about 3 p.m., the fire rushed up Dam Canyon, jumped a hastily constructed firebreak, and advanced on the workers, killing dozens and injuring more than 100. By nightfall the fire was under control, having burned about 47 acre.|$|R
5000|$|On the 8th {{episode that}} {{originally}} aired on 10 June 2009, Ho opened the show by sucker-punching Conan to [...] "give him {{a sense of}} what a real hit feels like". The duo continued with a choreographed fight scene in which Conan portrayed the [...] "thug fighter" [...] and Ho the [...] "hero fighter". A theatrical property ("prop") <b>fire</b> extinguisher and <b>shovel</b> were incorporated into the fight choreography and the segment ended with Ho ratcheting Conan through a breakaway glass window. Comedian Dane Cook was also a guest that night.|$|R

50|$|In September 1859-60, Thomas {{was arrested}} and tried {{for the murder of}} Catherine during a drunken binge in which he hit her across the head many times with a <b>fire</b> <b>shovel.</b> He was convicted of {{manslaughter}} and sentenced to 2 years hard labour at Darlinghurst Gaol.|$|E
5000|$|Abraham Lincoln {{named him}} {{governor}} of Utah Territory in 1861, {{but he left}} the territory and his post as governor after only three weeks due to tensions with the Mormon residents. Dawson allegedly made [...] "grossly improper proposals" [...] to the Mormon widow Albina Merrill Williams, who responded by thrashing him with a <b>fire</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
60|$|Joseph rattled some <b>fire</b> {{into the}} <b>shovel,</b> and went: but {{he brought it}} back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, {{explaining}} that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and {{it struck me that}} he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he had rather we had no suspicion.|$|R
5000|$|Owasco {{was damaged}} during {{a series of}} violent storms in January 1962, when wind gusts at times reached 80 miles an hour. A {{lifeboat}} was damaged by a wave and her SPS-29 radar antenna sheared off, while the crew was obliged to work continuously to keep the cutter free from ice. A photo caption from the time noted: [...] "Using muscle power and a baseball bat, a crewman attacks ice formed of spray on the superstructure of the Coast Guard's 255-foot cutter OWASCO during her recent weather patrol and plane guard duty on Ocean Station [...] "Bravo" [...] situated in the passage between Labrador and Greenland. A northeaster picked up spume from high waves and deposited it as ice over the vessel. Crewmen fought this ice battle for ten hours to preserve the ship's stability. They use bats, pick handles, meat cleavers, <b>fire</b> axes, <b>shovels</b> and other objects to crack away the dangerous tons of white weight." ...|$|R
50|$|Going {{outside to}} look around, Mark and Meagan rush back inside {{when they find}} Laura and Jeff's bodies crucified and ablaze. As Meagan tries {{to call the police}} Mark arms himself with a gun and has Meagan flee outside when Jonas appears. Rushing to the roof of the house, Mark is stabbed in the foot through the roof by Jonas, causing him to fall to the ground below. After Jonas {{finishes}} off Mark by hurling his crucifix into the boy's chest, Meagan is stalked through the house by the fanatic, who she manages to briefly incapacitate by spraying him in the face with bug spray. Going outside and getting Mark's earlier dropped gun, Meagan gets bullets from inside and, after being phoned by the police (a call which is interrupted by Jonas) goes to the wood shed outside. After missing several times Meagan manages to shoot Jonas and, believing him dead, begins praying for forgiveness, only to be attacked mid-prayer by the still living Jonas, who begins setting the barn on <b>fire.</b> Grabbing a <b>shovel,</b> Meagan beats Jonas with it and rushes outside and locks the door, leaving Jonas to burn and subsequently be blown up when the shed explodes.|$|R

50|$|Fitzpatrick {{returned}} to Benalla police station claiming that Ellen Kelly had struck {{him with a}} <b>fire</b> <b>shovel,</b> Dan Kelly had beaten him, and Ned Kelly had attempted to shoot him. William Williamson and William Skillion, neighbours of the Kellys, were also accused of violence. Ellen Kelly received a long sentence for her alleged crime, based purely on Fitzpatrick's claims. Ned and Dan Kelly fled into the Wombat Ranges to avoid gaol. On the 25 October 1878, at Stringybark Creek, they ambushed four police officers who {{had been sent to}} arrest them. Three of the officers were killed. Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart now turned to bank robbery.|$|E
50|$|Out of work, Woody is weary {{from looking}} for a place to rent, and he {{complains}} about his not having any living quarters. He is then approached by city slicker Buck Beaver, who convinces him to buy some magic beans. Woody plants them, and a beanstalk shoots up to the clouds. An elevator takes Woody to a giant's castle, where he finds the dopey giant asleep and initially fails to wake him up. Woody puts mustard, red pepper and horseradish on his tongue, which does the trick. Woody hides from the giant in a stuffed olive and is almost swallowed until he uses a car jack to get out before smacking the giant with a <b>fire</b> <b>shovel,</b> throwing a banana peel, and setting the giant's toes on fire.|$|E
2500|$|A fire {{began in}} one of Titanics coal bunkers [...] {{approximately}} 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships due to spontaneous combustion of the coal. The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses, by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace. This event has led some authors to theorise that the fire exacerbated {{the effects of the}} iceberg collision, by reducing the structural integrity of the hull and a critical bulkhead. Senan Molony has suggested that attempts to extinguish the <b>fire</b> - by <b>shovelling</b> burning coals into the engine furnaces - may have been the primary reason for the Titanic steaming at full speed prior to the collision, despite ice warnings. Most experts, on the contrary, disagree. Samuel Halpern, for example, has concluded that [...] "the bunker fire would not have weakened the watertight bulkhead sufficiently to cause it to collapse." [...] Also, {{it has been suggested that}} the coal bunker fire actually helped Titanic to last longer during the sinking and prevented the ship from rolling over to starboard after the impact, due to the subtle port list created by the moving of coal inside the ship prior to the encounter with the iceberg. Some of these foremost Titanic experts have published a detailed rebuttal of Molony's claims.|$|R
40|$|Yavneh II is {{the second}} and last {{excavation}} report on the dramatic favissa/genizah pit full of Philistine votive objects, discovered by Raz Kletter {{in the city of}} Yavneh, Israel, near the Mediterranean coast (south of Tel Aviv). The first volume, Yavneh I (OBO. SA 30, 2010) included studies on the history and archaeological exploration of Yavneh, the excavation, the stratigraphy and the interpretation of the pit as a favissae of votive objects that originate from a public temple; but especially on the mysterious cult stands, which number more than a hundred and include many stands with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. In the present volume we publish many additional cultic finds, including <b>fire</b> pans or <b>shovels</b> {{that could be used for}} moving hot coals and for burning incense (comparable to the biblical maḥtāh); a rectangular shrine-model (naos) with detached pillars; zoomorphic vessels; a larger sample of pottery with statistical analysis; imported Cypriot pottery; dog bones (probably related to ritual); an inscription on a bowl; fragments of worked stones (perhaps from altars); and chemical residues from juglets and chalices, which seem to indicate presence of hallucinatory and incense materials. In addition, we offer an update on the iconography of the Yavneh cult stands and a study of the larger world of cult stands in the southern Levant; criteria for identifying favissae and their appearance from the Late Bronze Age to the Persian Period in Palestine; and a concluding discussion on Yavneh, incense, and Philistine ethnicity...|$|R

5000|$|Massialot {{describes}} {{himself in his}} preface as [...] "a cook who dares to qualify himself royal, {{and it is not}} without cause, for the meals which he describes...have all been served at court or in the houses of princes, and of people of the first rank." [...] Places where Massialot served banquets included the Château de Sceaux, the Château de Meudon, and Versailles. An innovation in Massialot's book was the alphabetisation of recipes, [...] "a step toward the first culinary dictionary" [...] Barbara Wheaton observes; Wheaton has compared the changes made in the various editions of Massialot: a glass of white wine in a fish stock makes a surprisingly late appearance, in 1703. Meringues make their first appearance under their familiar name in Massialot, who is also credited with Crème brûlée, in which the sugar topping was melted and burnt with a red-hot <b>fire</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For an old Man that Travelled up {{and down}} the Country, and had some {{acquaintance}} at that house, calling in and asking the Man of the house how he did and his Wife; He told him that himself was well, but his Wife {{had been a long time}} in a languishing condition, and that she was haunted with a thing in the shape of a Bird that would flurr sic near to her face, and that she could not enjoy her natural rest well. The Old Man bid him and his Wife be of good courage. It was but a dead Spright, he said, and he would put him in a course to rid his Wife of this languishment and trouble, He therefore advised him to take a Bottle, and put his Wives Urine into it, together with Pins and Needles and Nails, and Cork them up and set the Bottle to the Fire well corkt, which when it had felt a while the heat of the Fire began to move and joggle a little, but he for sureness took the <b>Fire</b> <b>shovel,</b> and held it hard upon the Cork, And as he thought, he felt something one while on this side, another while on that, shove the <b>Fire</b> <b>shovel</b> off, which he still quickly put on Again, but at last at one shoving the Cork bounced out, and the Urine, Pins, Nails and Needles all flew up, and gave a report like a Pistol, and his Wife continued in the same trouble and languishment still.Not long after, the Old Man came to the house again, and inquired of the Man of the house how his Wife did. Who answered, as ill as ever, if not worse. He askt him if he had followed his direction. Yes, says he, and told him the event as is above said. Ha, quoth he, it seems it was too nimble for you. But now I will put you in a way that will make the business sure. Take your Wive’s Urine as before, and Cork, it in a Bottle with Nails, Pins and Needles, and bury it in the Earth; and that will do the feat. The Man did accordingly. And his Wife began to mend sensibly and in a competent time was finely well recovered; But there came a Woman from a Town some miles off to their house, with a lamentable Out-cry, that they had killed her Husband. They askt her what she meant and thought her distracted, telling her they knew neither her nor her Husband. Yes, saith she, you have killed my Husband, he told me so on his Death-bed. But at last they understood by her, that her Husband was a Wizard, and had bewitched this Mans Wife and that this Counter-practice prescribed by the Old Man, which saved the Mans Wife from languishment, was the death of that Wizard that had bewitched her.|$|E
50|$|This {{model was}} not the only one made by Murdoch as he {{continued}} experimenting with the design and by August 1786 had made at least one other model, of a different size, which we know of. Apart from this Murdoch does not appear to have worked much on his ideas from 1784 to 1786, because of the continuing high volume of work for Boulton and Watt, his marriage in 1785, and the birth of his and his wife's twins in the same year. Shortly after this birth, and with a second model already built, Murdoch took steps to patent his steam locomotive. However, at Exeter on the way to London he was met by Boulton who persuaded him to return to Cornwall without registering the patent. As Boulton wrote to Watt on 2 September 1795:He said He was going to London to get Men but I soon found he was going there with his Steam Carg to shew it & to take out a patent. He having been told by Mr W. Wilkn what Sadler had said & he had likewise read in the news paper Simmingtons puff which had rekindled all Wms fire & impations to make Steam Carriages.
