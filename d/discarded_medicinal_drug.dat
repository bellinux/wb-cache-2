40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> use have been {{associated}} with an increased likelihood of involvement in a road traffic crash, namely for psychotropic medication and especially at the beginning of treatment (benzodiazepines). We have analyzed involvement in road traffic crashes for 4491 drivers attending two Spanish Medical Driver Test Centres for assessment of their fitness to drive. The 36. 5 % of drivers have consumed <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> in the previous year. The 4. 5 % of drivers were taking a <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> with a warning in the Summary of Product Characteristics concerning the effect of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> on the ability to drive. Those drivers taking <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> with a warning in the Summary of Product Characteristics showed an increased risk of involvement in a road traffic crash (OR = 2. 51, 95 % CI = 1. 63 - 3. 85), while those drivers taking a <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> without such a warning did not (OR = 0. 82, 95 % CI = 0. 61 - 1. 08) when compared with those drivers not taking <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> (OR = 1). The present results highlight the importance of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> on road traffic crashes and the need to offer appropriate information to the driver taking these <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs.</b> KEY WORDS: <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> – road traffic crash- risk assessmen...|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} of pulmonary toxicity due to <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> is to discontinue (= to stop taking) the <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> in question. A dose reduction (instead of discontinuation) can be attempted in selected cases only, only {{under the guidance}} of an expert physician. Discontinuation (or, if possible, dose reduction {{under the guidance of}} an expert physician) should be done in all cases.

40|$|Although most industrialized {{countries}} have been more interested in alcohol and illicit drugs and driving, in recent years attention has begun {{to focus on the}} potential impairing properties of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs.</b> Descriptive epidemiological studies examining the prevalence of drugs and alcohol have found <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as benzodiazipines, to be commonly used among crashed drivers. For example, benzodiazapines were found in 12. 4 % of injured drivers in a Canadian study and was the second most common drug detected and were also the second most common drug found in an Australian study. Despite this high prevalence, which begs the need for case-control studies and continued experimental and laboratory research, only Europe seems to be conducting the bulk of the research on this topic. This is particularly curious, given the ageing population who {{are more likely to be}} taking <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> than alcohol or illicit drugs, and the trends in western countries to de-hospitalization, day-surgeries, and community-based living of frail elderly. This paper will provide a brief synopsis of the epidemiological and experimental research on <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> and impairment. This will be followed by a discussion of the issues and challenges in conducting research on <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> and driving...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of psychotropic medicines in drivers suspected of driving under the influence of <b>medicinal</b> and illicit <b>drugs</b> in The Netherlands and to compare the prevalence of selected impairing medicines with the use of these medicines in the general Dutch population. In total, 3038 blood samples of suspected impaired drivers in The Netherlands have been analyzed for the presence of <b>medicinal</b> and illicit <b>drugs</b> between January 2009 and December 2012. In 94 % (2842 / 3038) of the cases <b>medicinal</b> and/or illicit <b>drugs</b> were detected. <b>Medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> were found in 33 % of the blood samples, with the highest prevalence for anxiolytics. In 86 % of the cases illicit drug-positive results were obtained, with the highest prevalence for cannabis. At least in 56 % of the blood samples poly-drug use was determined, including <b>medicinal</b> and/or illicit <b>drugs.</b> The highest prevalence of poly-medicine use was found for combinations including anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. In general, the prevalence of driving impairing medicines in suspected impaired drivers is higher than the use of these medicines in the general Dutch population, due to a positive selection bias in the first population. Differences between both populations may be explained by the used methodological approach (e. g., classification criteria of analytical findings, sample selection bias) and abuse of certain <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> (e. g., diazepam). Negative effects of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> on driving performance determine largely the prevalence in the population of suspected impaired drivers. The degree of impairment depends on different factors, including pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and pharmacodynamic aspects. More research is needed to study the prevalence of all prescribed driving impairing medicines and to investigate if providing additional information to <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> users on driving impairing medicines would lower the prevalence of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> positive drivers...|$|R
40|$|After the {{definite}} breakthrough of {{the awakening}} {{to the negative}} effects of alcohol on traffic safety, some 50 years ago in the sixties of the past century (see Borkenstein et al., 1974), authorities began to worry about <b>drugs,</b> initially <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs.</b> After World War II, the prescription and administration of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> expanded enormously. Pharmaceutical research was booming, for instance leading to the extremely successful introduction of Benzodiazepines, a group of depressing drugs administered for various symptoms. Laboratory studies gave strong indications that at least some <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> were likely to affect traffic safety. However, contrary to alcohol, no unambiguous effect with respect to traffic safety could be assessed easily by standard methodology, i. e. epidemiological research. Thereupon a new line of experimental research was developed, in the field itself, by means of instrumented vehicles. People were administered <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs,</b> and placebo in double- blind within-subjects cross-over designs, driving on closed circuits or in some countries even out on the public road under strict surveillance. Several performance measures were registered, of which ‘‘swerving’’ or ‘‘weaving’’, i. e. the control over lateral position as measured by the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) came forth as the most promising. To date SDLP proved itself as the most valid and reliable indicator of performance deterioration, and is at the basis of recently developed categorization systems of (<b>medicinal)</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Producción CientíficaThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{presence}} of alcohol, illicit <b>drugs</b> and <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> among Spanish drivers involved in fatal road accidents between 1991 and 2000. Samples were obtained for 5745 drivers killed in road accidents from January 1991 to December 2000. Of the samples, 91. 7 % represented males and 8. 3 % females; 40. 7 % were under 30 years of age, 31. 9 % were under 31 – 50 years of age, 19. 5 % were over 51 years of age, and for 7. 9 % the age was unknown. Between 1991 and 2000, some type of psychoactive substance was detected among 50. 1 % of those drivers killed in road accidents, this being mainly alcohol (43. 8 %) and, less frequently, illicit drugs (8. 8 %) and <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> (4. 7 %). In all the cases, in which alcohol was detected, combined use with other substances accounted for only 12. 5 %, whilst in the case of illicit and <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs,</b> figures representing combined use with other substances were 75. 6 % for the former and 65. 8 % for the latter. For one in every three cases (32. 0 %), a blood alcohol level over 0. 8 g/l was recorded; cocaine (5. 2 %), opiates (3. 2 %) and cannabis (2. 2 %) were the three illicit drugs most frequently detected. Among <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs,</b> were benzodiazepines (3. 4 %), anti-depressant drugs (0. 6 %) and analgesics (0. 4 %). The results show the frequent presence of psychoactive substances, particularly alcohol, among Spanish motor vehicle users involved in fatal road accidents.

40|$|Background: Medical {{practitioners}} utilize drug promotional {{materials from}} pharmaceutical companies {{as a major}} source of information especially in developing countries. These promo-tional materials can be highly informative {{as long as they are}} critically appraised but when they are accepted without ques-tion, they lead to irrational prescribing. Aim: To sensitize the students regarding WHO criteria for <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> promotion and to determine the impact of teaching critical appraisal of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> promotion to medical students. Design: The medical students of second year were given a pre test question-naire to identify the violations in generic labeling, pharmacolo-gical information, claims, relevance and references cited in the drug advertisements. Later they were sensitized about the WHO criteria for <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> promotion and how to critically ap-praise a drug advertisement. This was followed by a post test questionnaire with the same drug advertisement. Result: The number of students answering the post test correctly was signi-ficantly (p< 0. 05) more than that of pre test.

40|$|International audiencePurpose To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} epidemiological research into effects of <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> on traffic safety and the current knowledge in this area. Data sources The bibliographic search was done in Medline electronic database using the keywords: ((accident* or crash*) and traffic and drug*) leading to 1141 references. Additional references were retrieved from the Safetylit website and the reference lists of selected studies. Original articles published in English or French, between 1 April 1979 and 31 July 2008, were considered for inclusion. We excluded descriptive studies, studies limited to alcohol or illicit drug involvement and investigations of injuries other than from traffic crashes. Studies based on laboratory tests, driving simulators or on-the-road driving tests were also excluded. Eligible studies had to {{evaluate the}} causal relationship {{between the use of}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> and the risk of traffic crashes. Study quality was assessed by two independent experts, according to a grid adapted from the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) statement. Results Twenty two studies of variable methodological quality were included. Definition of drug exposure varied across studies and depended on the data sources. Potential confounding due to the interaction between the effects of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>drug</b> and disease-related symptoms was often not controlled. The risk of motor-vehicle crashes related to benzodiazepines has been amply studied and demonstrated. Results for other <b>medicinal</b> <b>drugs</b> remain controversial.
