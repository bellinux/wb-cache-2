40|$|The {{contribution}} of individual branches {{to the current}} annual xylem increment of the main stem of six young red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) was investigated. Logical estimates of branch productivity including: branch foliage dry weight, current <b>extension</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the primary branch axis, and the current annual xylem increment measured as ring width at branch base (CAXI-branch base); were related to wood growth on the tree bole. CAXI-branch base was hypothesized {{to be the best}} single indicator of a branch's contribution to bolewood growth. This parameter was incorporated into a crown vigor index (CVI) designed to simulate vertically distributed bolewood increment. CVI was also related to other similar bole growth simulation models. No clear correspondence was found between the vertical distribution of the annual bolewood increment and the branch parameters: foliage dry weight, current <b>extension</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the primary branch axis, and CAXI-branch base. The regularity of these branch parameter measurements throughout the tree crown compared to a well defined bolewood increment pattern suggested, however, that an indirect relationship between the two existed. The incorporation of CAXI-branch base into the crown vigor index made it possible to statistically relate this branch parameter to actual bolewood increment. CVI bole growth simulations, in general, corresponded closely to bolewood increment values. Notable exceptions occured on trees with anomalous growth patterns and at points of localized bending stress. CVI bole growth simulations proved to be superior to other bole growth models of similar construction. The technique for measuring CAXI-branch base is a destructive process which is complex and tedious. A practical modification to the CVI model was to estimate CAXI-branch base from readily obtainable branch parameters. The best estimate of CAXI-branch base was the product total branch foliage dry weight and the current <b>extension</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the primary branch axis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calibrate the straightness and the squareness of the XY-stage for precision manufacturing and measurement. Normally it is calibrated using much higher precise and accurate measuring instruments and/or artifacts. The high precision and accurate instruments and artifacts are expensive. So, in this paper, Self-calibration method is applied to XY-stage. This method does not require any much high precision and accurate instruments and artifacts. The normal XY-stage moves to the location at the unique coordinates. In this case, {{it is difficult to}} apply self-calibration method. Therefore, XY-stage is expanded to XYθ-stage with parallel mechanism. As this stage moves to the location at a lot of coordinates, self-calibration method is applied. This method is confirmed in simulation and experiment. In simulation, the <b>extension</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> mechanism are estimated from known kinematic parameters and the target coordinates. After that, estimated kinematic parameters are calculated by least-squares method from the <b>extension</b> <b>lengths</b> and the target coordinates.

All patients received ultrasound measurement of aorta during each admission. Results: Our results indicated that changes <b>of</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> AAA were significantly greater in patients with diabetes than those in patients without diabetes.

Despite routine vaccination programs, sporadic cases have occasionally occurred in the country and remain a constant threat to commercial poultry. Hence, the present study was aimed to characterize NDV isolates obtained from clinical cases in various locations of Malaysia between 2004 and 2007 based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of partial F gene and C-terminus <b>extension</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> HN gene. Results The coding region of eleven NDV isolates fusion (F) gene and carboxyl terminal region of haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene including extensions were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR and directly sequenced. All the isolates have shown to have non-synonymous to synonymous base substitution rate ranging between 0. 081 - 0. 264 demonstrating presence of negative selection. Analysis based on F gene showed the characterized isolates possess three different types of protease cleavage site motifs; namely 112 RRQKRF 117, 112 RRRKRF 117 and 112 GRQGRL 117 and appear to show maximum identities with isolates in the region such as cockatoo/ 14698 / 90 (Indonesia), Ch/ 2000 (China), local isolate AF 2240 indicating the high similarity of isolates circulating in the South East Asian countries. Meanwhile, one of the isolates resembles commonly used lentogenic vaccine strains. On further characterization of the HN gene, Malaysian isolates had C-terminus extensions of 0, 6 and 11 amino acids.
