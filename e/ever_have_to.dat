5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: [...] "Finding the courage to tell someone about being abused {{is one of the most}} difficult decisions a child will <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make."

500|$|... "Islands" [...] {{was written}} by The xx band-members Jamie Smith, Oliver Sim, Romy Madley Croft and then-member Baria Qureshi, for the English indie pop band's self-titled debut album (2009). According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is composed in the key of C# minor and has a metronome of 123 beats per minute. Sim and Croft provide vocals in the track, and their range spans from G#3 to E4. Similar to the band's usual style of production, [...] "Islands" [...] is dark and [...] "nocturnal" [...] in nature and follows a [...] "simple, effective" [...] beat. It features instrumentation from guitars which [...] "twirl like dance floor partners in the background" [...] and synthesisers that [...] "play like a musical shadow". According to BBC Music's Lou Thomas, the song features house rhythms and a melody {{similar to that of}} Tom Petty's 1989 song [...] "I Won't Back Down". Lyrically, [...] "Islands" [...] is a [...] "psycho-geographical love song" [...] and contains themes of loyalty, which are heard in lines like [...] "I am yours now, so I don’t <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave". The duo's vocals were described as [...] "girl-boy", with Croft's vocal delivery taking on a [...] "pleasant soft-pop vibe". Sim momentarily interrupts the verses with [...] "four short thumbings". A [...] "typically heartfelt and bed-cuddly" [...] refrain [...] "I am yours now" [...] is repeated throughout the song, and UK-based online publication Muso's Guide regarded it as [...] "the closest thing The xx has produced to a hook".|$|E

[...] Possessor-raising also violates a constraint on syntactic movement, the specificity constraint: an element cannot be moved out of a DP if that DP is specific. In (23), the DP lui is specific, yet possessor-raising predicts it can be moved out of the larger DP lui la figure. Such movement is excluded by the specificity constraint.|$|E

2500|$|Minor Threat's song [...] "Guilty of Being White" [...] {{led to some}} {{accusations of}} racism, but MacKaye has {{strongly}} denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To me, {{at the time and}} now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1894 he {{introduced}} {{and carried a}} memorable budget, which equalised the death duties on real and personal property. After Gladstone's retirement in 1894 and Lord Rosebery's selection as prime minister, Harcourt became {{the leader of the}} Liberal party in the House of Commons, but it was never probable that he would work comfortably in the new conditions. He had been ignored as Gladstone's successor, and it was evident that Rosebery's ideas of Liberalism and of the policy of the Liberal Party were not those of Harcourt. Their differences were patched up from time to time, but the combination was unstable. However the one significant legacy of the government was the introduction of a high uniform rate of death duties in Harcourt's 1894 budget. Harcourt himself was a second son, and thus unlikely to <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay such duties himself, so it was often quipped that this introduction was a [...] "second son's revenge". [...] However, this proved to not be the case, when Harcourt inherited the Nuneham Park estate in Oxfordshire.|$|E
2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, [...] "How do you know that it is not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?" [...] Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore stopped crying.|$|E
