5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence <b>Kling,</b> five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos <b>Kling</b> was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence <b>Kling</b> had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|The 42-year-old captain, Michael <b>Kling,</b> held {{an airline}} {{transport}} pilot certificate and type ratings for the Boeing 707, Boeing 737, and Learjet 35. He also had Air Force experience flying the KC-135 and Boeing E-3 Sentry. <b>Kling</b> was also an instructor pilot on the KC-135E in the Maine Air National Guard. According to Sunjet Aviation records, the captain had accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of flight time (military and commercial) and had flown a total of 60 hours with Sunjet, 38 as a Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 as a Learjet second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl <b>Kling</b> and his old teammate Hermann Lang. <b>Kling</b> {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century progressed, chess {{organization}} developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club {{played against}} the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became {{a regular part of}} 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef <b>Kling,</b> and Samuel Loyd composed {{some of the}} most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.|$|E
5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger {{injuries}} suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny <b>Kling</b> became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{peritoneal fluid}} (PF) {{of women with}} endometriosis {{contains}} protease(s) activity able to hydrolyze insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3), increasing the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) locally. Therefore, we characterized the effects of IGF- 1 on <b>KLE</b> endometrial-like cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mitogenic effect of IGF- 1 was assessed by {{the analysis of the}} DNA content and cell count. Apoptosis was triggered experimentally by the 48 hr exposure of <b>KLE</b> cells to 100 nM of adriamycin in the presence and absence of IGF- 1 (50 ng/ml). Adriamycin apoptosis of <b>KLE</b> cells was determined by the number of dead <b>KLE</b> cells using trypan blue exclusion and by the DNA fragmentation on simple agarose gel and flow cytometry of propidium iodide and HOECHST 33342 -stained <b>KLE</b> cells using an EPICS 753 pulse cytometer. RESULTS: IGF- 1 stimulated the growth of <b>KLE</b> cells in a dose-dependent manner (optimal dose of 50 ng/ml) and protected <b>KLE</b> cells from adriamycin (100 nM) -induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IGF- 1 is a survival factor for <b>KLE</b> cells. Conceivably, increased IGF- 1 activity in the PF can optimize both the survival and ectopic growth of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity...|$|R

5|$|Frank Chance {{joined the}} Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a reserve catcher, backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny <b>Kling.</b> Frank Selee, the Cubs' manager, decided that Chance {{would be better}} suited as a first baseman. Chance at first opposed the move and even {{threatened}} to quit, but ultimately obliged. Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league baseball, but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop, replacing Barry McCormick. Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base. Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base to back up Bobby Lowe.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the <b>kling</b> of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{generate}} samples of a random field using the <b>KLE,</b> when the size of the domain is much larger than the correlation length and a direct <b>KLE</b> is not affordable because of the computational effort. The technique presented inÂ [33], that deals with the representation of cross-correlated random fields using the <b>KLE,</b> is here adapted to overcome this issue. At first the whole domain is split in small sub-domains (with a size of few correlation lengths). The modal decomposition of the covariance operator is computed in a small sub-domain where the computational effort is easily affordable and a reduced number of terms are needed for the <b>KLE.</b> Then, independent random samples are generated in each sub-domain and, finally, the assembling is made by conditioning the <b>KLE</b> coefficients to obtain continuous samples of the random fields having the prescribed covariance function. InÂ [33] the authors model a set of correlated random fields by imposing a correlation between the <b>KLE</b> coefficients of each random field. In this work, the same idea is used for correlating sets of <b>KLE</b> coefficients related to local regions of a large domain.|$|R
30|$|Another way for {{generating}} random fields is the KarhunenâLoÃ¨ve expansion (<b>KLE,</b> [18, 19]), {{which is based}} on the covariance kernel modal decomposition on a finite domainÂ [20, 21]. The <b>KLE</b> has been extensively used for representing random fluctuating properties in different engineering problemsÂ [22 â 24]. IWhile the spectral representation is optimal in mean-square sense on an infinitely large domain, the <b>KLE</b> is optimal on a finite domain. Moreover, one of the main advantages is that this expansion can also be directly applied for non-stationary processes. Different numerical methods exist for solving the covariance decomposition for the KLEÂ [25, 26]. In the case of stationary covariances, the modal functions can be approximated by means of Fourier transformsÂ [27 â 29] to reduce the computational complexity, but the application of the <b>KLE</b> in a very large domain compared to the correlation length still remains unaffordable. For a given mean-square error, The number of needed terms in the <b>KLE</b> grows as shown inÂ [30], with the size of the domain. In some applications, for avoiding the <b>KLE</b> decomposition, known families of polynomials are used to parametrize the random fieldÂ [31, 32], but they do not minimize the mean-square error as the <b>KLE</b> does.|$|R
