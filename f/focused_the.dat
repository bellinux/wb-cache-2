5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E

For example, if the root dalus clean is cast in <b>the</b> Patient <b>focus,</b> <b>the</b> resulting meaning is to clean (something). But, if cast in <b>the</b> Directional <b>focus,</b> <b>the</b> resulting meaning is to clean (something) off, <b>the</b> <b>focused</b> noun phrase becomes the area affected instead of the object affected.|$|R

5|$|Although Johnson had <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that {{he would no longer}} campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E

5|$|In summer 2002 {{the cause}} of his {{hamstring}} injury was discovered, and he underwent an operation to relieve a blockage in the arteries of his right leg which had been severely restricting circulation. During his recovery he appeared as a pundit for ITV's coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Ranieri initiated a squad rotation system for the 2002–03 season, but <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> team around Gianfranco Zola, which limited Hasselbaink's playing time. Barcelona manager Louis van Gaal agreed an £8 million transfer for Hasselbaink in the January transfer window after months of negotiations but was dismissed before the transfer went through and the deal subsequently collapsed.

5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and <b>focused,</b> <b>the</b> team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Burnet's {{research}} {{moved to}} influenza and scrub typhus. With {{the outbreak of}} war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the institute. Fearing {{a repeat of the}} massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, Bence filmed El tercer beso, {{directed}} by Luis César Amadori and co-starring Pedro López Lagar and Silvia Legrand. Though Bence {{was concerned about}} playing the mother of Legrand, who was only 13 years younger than she was, the film was a success and she won her the Silver Condor Award for Best Actress from the Argentine Film Critics Association for the performance. The recognition led to her appearance frequently {{on the covers of}} magazines, and to an offer to appear in what would {{become one of the most}} important films in the history of Argentine cinema, La guerra gaucha. The film starred Bence and Sebastián Chiola, Ángel Magaña, Enrique Muiño, and Francisco Petrone and is set at the turn of the nineteenth century in northern Argentina. It was shot on location in Salta Province and was based on the novel of the same name by writer Leopoldo Lugones. Scriptwriters Hómero Manzi and Ulises Petit de Murat, wove the disparate stories of the characters into an overview of the gauchos' revolt against Spanish rule. The film, unlike Hollywood Westerns, neither portrayed colonization as progress, nor <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> action on the indigenous people, instead focusing on the patriotic pride of the gauchos. The film won seven awards and Bence won an award as best actress of the year from the City of Buenos Aires. It also earned her an offer from Paramount Pictures to come to the US and work in Hollywood, but she declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit of Venus {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks <b>focused</b> <b>the</b> image of the Sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper, where the image could be safely observed. After observing {{for most of the}} day, he was lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus, as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the astronomical unit. He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E
