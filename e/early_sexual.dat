5|$|The end of {{the rapid}} growth phase {{suggests}} the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing {{appears to be a}} shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals, such as humans and elephants.

5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSexual health-risk {{behaviors}} in disruptive children are poorly understood. In a longitudinal population-based sample, event-time analyses showed that subjects {{with high levels}} of conduct disorder symptoms, particularly in combination with simultaneously high levels of hyperactivity-inattention symptoms, exhibited the highest risk for <b>earlier</b> <b>sexual</b> activity compared to controls, suggesting the need for prevention...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to conflicting {{evidence on the}} link between poverty and risky sexual behaviour by examining the effect of wealth status on age at first sex, condom use, and multiple partners using nationally representative adolescents' data from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi, and Uganda. The {{results show that the}} wealthiest girls in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Malawi had later sexual debut compared with their poorer counterparts but this association was not significant for Uganda. Wealth status was weaker among males and significant only in Malawi, where those in the middle quintile had <b>earlier</b> <b>sexual</b> debut. Wealthier adolescents were most likely to use condoms at the last sexual act, but wealth status was not associated with number of sexual partners. Although the link between wealth status and sexual behaviour is not consistent, there is evidence that poor females are vulnerable to infection because of <b>earlier</b> <b>sexual</b> debut and non-use of condoms...|$|R
25|$|An {{estimated}} 1.8 {{percent of}} the age 18–49 population of Jamaica was HIV positive in 2011. The rate for {{men who have sex}} with men was 32.8 percent. The highest rates of infection were in the most urbanised parishes and in tourist areas. The HIV epidemic has been closely tied to poverty and developmental and socio-cultural issues, including slow economic growth, high levels of unemployment, <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> debut, the culture of multiple partnerships, and the informal drug and commercial sex sectors.|$|E
25|$|Medullary bone {{has been}} found in {{specimens}} of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity before they were full-grown. Sexual maturity at sub-adult size is also found in reptiles and in medium- to large-sized mammals, but birds and small mammals reach sexual maturity only after they are full-grown—which happens within their first year. <b>Early</b> <b>sexual</b> maturity is also associated with specific features of animals' life cycles: the young are born relatively well-developed rather than helpless; and the death-rate among adults is high.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
50|$|Two recent {{epidemiologic}} {{studies in}} the United States (PROS and NMANES III) highlighted a recent unexpected advance in sexual maturation in girls. American, European and Asian studies suggest breast development in girls occurs at a much younger age than a few decades ago, irrespective of race and socioeconomic conditions.

25|$|Opposition due to {{the safety}} of the vaccine has been {{addressed}} through studies, leaving opposition focused on the sexual implications of the vaccine to remain. Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. They also say that it will lead to <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both the Family Research Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E
25|$|It is {{agreed on}} by some psychologists that {{experiences}} during <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> development {{can have a}} profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Male-to-male {{competition}} {{for access to}} females and for resources that the females require {{for themselves and their}} offspring is common and can explain the morphological phenotypic traits and behaviors, such as large body size, weapons, territoriality, and <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> maturation that increase their possibilities of gaining access to the females. In many social insects, larger males are more competitive and tend to monopolize females or the resources that they need. In bees, females may choose males who are faster, more agile, or more persistent fliers. Sequestering of females and forced copulation may also favor large male size. Males with longer horns and mandibles can use them to fight, or for take over attempts when rivals are copulating. In beetle species, the male horns can be as long as the male’s body. Early sexually mature males can start their reproductive life before the rest of the male population. Under scramble competition to inseminate females, the early matured males are smaller but can be favored in some cases where courtship occurs on the ground and attain the highest reproductive success. Thus, in the fly Drosophila suboscura, smaller males are better than large males at tracking females during the courtship dance.|$|E
500|$|Tripp {{discusses}} bisexuality, inversion, transvestism, and transsexualism {{in relation}} to homosexuality. Tripp maintains that homosexuality and inversion, though sometimes associated with each other, are distinct phenomena. He argues that there are several different kinds of bisexuality, and that while some bisexuals are simply unconcerned by the gender of their sexual partners, others [...] "rate and choose their male and female partners by applying quite separate sets of criteria", which could be formed by various different processes, including {{but not limited to}} <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences with persons of both sexes, or for a men a special form of machismo. [...] Tripp argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and of non-conformist behavior in general, arguing that such respect for diversity has many potential benefits to society.|$|E

500|$|In the November 1982 {{issue of}} Siecus Report, {{published}} by the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, Bell wrote that he was astonished by his finding that [...] "parent-child relationships" [...] are less influential {{in the development of}} sexual orientation than has often been thought. Bell argued that in order to understand adult sexual behavior it is necessary to understand <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> feelings, which involve [...] "romantic attachments", with men who do not see themselves as [...] "typically masculine" [...] being more likely to experience such attachments toward other men. Bell argued that falling in love is a more important criterion of sexual orientation than sexual behavior, and that it can be understood as [...] "the anticipation of self-completion through merger with the love object" [...] and a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] through the [...] "integration of the masculine and feminine components of ourselves through the psychological incorporation of the greater preponderance of masculine or feminine characteristics one supposes are possessed by the object of our romantic feelings." [...] Bell suggested that early romantic and subsequent erotic attachments tend to be focused on people [...] "perceived as essentially different".|$|E
500|$|Early puberty {{and early}} {{masturbation}} are seen by Tripp as {{important factors in}} the development of male homosexuality, albeit not direct causes. He maintains that homosexual men tend to start masturbating earlier than heterosexual men, continue to masturbate more extensively {{for the rest of their}} lives, and also tend to have a larger than average penis size. Tripp sees <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences with persons of the same sex as having only a limited role {{in the development of}} male homosexuality. While he observes that homosexual men vary in their sexual attitudes, Tripp writes that, [...] "when two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp considers promiscuity [...] "relatively prevalent" [...] among homosexual men as a group, though he noted that not all homosexual men are promiscuous. Tripp maintains that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men if they had the same level of opportunity. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, writing that Kinsey and his associates found no evidence of their effectiveness. Tripp writes that a [...] "New York psychiatrist who for a number of years has headed a large psychoanalytic research program on homosexuality" [...] admitted to Pomeroy that he knew of only one patient he had helped to become heterosexual but was on such poor terms with him that he did not feel free to contact him so that he could verify his claim to have changed his sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Tripp {{attempts}} to describe homosexuality, {{the social context}} in which it occurs, and its biological and sociological implications. He acknowledges a debt to previous researchers, including the ethologist Frank A. Beach, the psychologist John Money, the biologist Alfred Kinsey, the sexologists Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin, the anthropologist Paul Gebhard, and the psychologist George Weinberg. Based on his review {{of the history of}} sexual laws and customs, he concludes that homosexuality has been called an [...] "aberration" [...] or [...] "perversion" [...] due to moral assumptions rooted partly in religious beliefs. Exploring the question of a possible biological basis to homosexuality, Tripp focuses on the issue of hormones. He argues that the existing evidence is too inconsistent to show any connection between male homosexuality and hormone levels, with studies showing homosexual men as having hormone levels sometimes lower and sometimes higher than those of heterosexual men. Tripp maintains that future {{attempts to}} establish a connection will inevitably fail, due to their false underlying assumptions. Based on studies suggesting that sexual patterns depend on learning in primates and other animals, Tripp argues that human sexual orientation also depends on learning. He argues that a majority of people are heterosexual because their upbringing has made them want and expect to be heterosexual, and that while early favorable heterosexual experiences help reinforce heterosexuality, there is an uneven correlation between <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> experience and adult sexual orientation. Tripp considers the context in which such experiences occurred to be crucial, writing that emotion or a sense of drama is needed to give them significance.|$|E

500|$|Most age {{categories}} of Albertosaurus {{are represented in}} the fossil record. Using bone histology, the age of an individual animal {{at the time of}} death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known Albertosaurus is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110lb) and measured slightly more than [...] in length. The [...] specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an S-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was [...] per year, based on an adult 1.3tonnes. Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to Albertosaurus had similar growth rates, although the much larger Tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate ( [...] per year) at its peak. The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants.

2500|$|Adolescence marks a time {{of sexual}} maturation, which manifests in social {{interactions}} as well. While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience {{during this period of}} development takes place within romantic relationships. Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin. Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, [...] "heavy" [...] sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality. This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship. Some research suggest that there are genetic causes of <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> activity that are also risk factors for delinquency, suggesting that there is a group who are at risk for both <b>early</b> <b>sexual</b> activity and emotional distress.
