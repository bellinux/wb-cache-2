It won't do to give way for a minute. If necessary you must take tonics, and have a steel rod down your back, if you can't keep yourself erect without it.

Well, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{just as much as}} ever. But there's something that's a whole lot more important. Somehow, I ain't ever had many friends. Some ways you're about the best friend I've ever had--you ain't neither too highbrow or too lowbrow. And this friendship business--it means such an awful lot. It's like what I was reading about--something by Elbert Hubbard or--thunder, I can't remember his name, but, anyway, it's one of those poet guys that writes for the back page of the Journal--something about a joyous adventure. That's what being friends is. Course you understand I wouldn't want to say this to most people, but you'll understand how I mean. It's--this friendship business is just like those old crusaders-- you know--they'd start out on a fine morning--you know; armor shining, all that stuff. It wouldn't make any dif. what they met as long as they was fighting together. Rainy nights with folks sneaking through the rain to get at 'em, and all sorts of things-- ready for anything, long as they just stuck together. That's the way this friendship business is, I b'lieve. Just like it said in the Journal. Yump, sure is. Gee! it's--Chance to tell folks what you think and really get some fun out of seeing places together. And I ain't ever done it much. Course I don't mean to say I've been living off on any blooming desert island all my life, but, just the same, I've always been kind of alone--not knowing many folks. You know how it is in a New York rooming-house. So now--Aw, don't slip up on me, Morty. Honestly, I don't care what kind of work we do {{as long as we can}} stick together; I don't care a hang if we don't get anything better to do than scrub floors!" ...|$|E

5000|$|For {{his seventh}} birthday, Gaiman {{received}} C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series.

40|$|The future’s {{uncertain}} {{and the end}} is always near ” – Jim Morrison Today I {{want to talk about}} the role of risk and uncertainty in the financial crisis. The primary reason why <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> is that I believe risk assessment, or more precisely, misassessment has been one of the key elements of the crisis. While that is undoubtedly true in any crisis, I think it has played a more central role in the current episode than in the past. Risk was mis-assessed by financial institutions, risk managers, investors and regulators. There was a false comfort taken from a misplaced belief that risk was being accurately and appropriately measured. To some extent, the technology provided risk managers with a false sense of security. Risk may well have been accurately measured for the particular regime that the economy and financial markets were operating in. But the risk assessment was not robust to a regime change that took the models out of their historical comfort zone. Not enough account was taken of uncertainty. One of the messages I want to leave you with is that risk measurement based on historical models can only take you so far. Judgement must play an important role. Ultimately, the future is uncertain, in the sense that it cannot be quantified. The goal should be to desig...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 I {{graduated}} from Fisher with B. A. ’s in Religious Studies and Sociology. After graduating from Fisher I had planned on attending Buffalo State College for graduate school but {{changed my mind}} that summer. I ended up staying in Rochester {{for a few months}} and looking around for a job (I must admit, however, I did not put much effort into this.) That fall I decided to move back to my hometown to see if I could find a job in or around the NYC area. Unable to find my ideal job, I ended up working in retail management for a little while. Once again, I applied to graduate school (this time in New York City) and right before classes started, I changed my mind about attending. I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t really quite sure of what I wanted for a career and didn 2 ̆ 7 t want to spend all that money on graduate school for something I might not end up really wanting to do. After that, I worked for a few months for a family friend. During the next few months I made up my mind as to what I really wanted to do, which was to work in a college or university. I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t find many jobs available to someone without a master 2 ̆ 7 s degree in a given field and so when I was offered a position in the office of an electrical contracting company, I decided to take that in the meantime. I worked for a very generous and fun boss and loved the people I worked with but did not want to stick with a job that I had no real passion for. I worked in this job for about a year, at which point I finally found a job in higher education institution (Purchase College, NY). This college job has made me realize that this is what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> this is the field I want to work in.
