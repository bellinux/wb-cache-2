500|$|Bangalter and Homem-Christo have {{credited}} {{many sources}} that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English {{as a second}} language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: [...] "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> {{to be in a}} band." [...] They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that [...] "put everything together" [...] in terms of genre".|$|E

[...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|Many songs {{performed}} by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God. Despite Welch being the lead singer, {{several of these}} characters are male. [...] Welch has commented, [...] "To be commercial, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> happy love songs. People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, {{as a matter of}} fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts." [...] To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. [...] Their tempo is compared to a [...] "slow heartbeat", and Cowperthwait of Rolling Stone observed that their songs [...] "can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation".|$|E

500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough.

If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I think {{he would have been a}} good England manager.

500|$|Monsieur Bertin was {{exhibited}} at the 1833 Salon alongside his 1807 [...] It met with near universal [...] praise to become his most successful artwork to that point. It sealed {{his reputation as a}} portraitist, reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires. Today it is considered his greatest portrait. Ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing, remarking that [...] "since my portraits of Bertin and Molé, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> portraits. There are six that I've turned down, or am avoiding, because I can't stand them." [...] Before the official exhibition, Ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils. Most were lavish in their praise, although Louis Lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might [...] "find the colouring a bit dreary". He proved correct; at the Salon, critics praised the draftsmanship, but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres' weakness as a colourist. It was routinely faulted for its [...] "purplish tone"—which the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns. Bertin's wife Louis-Marie reportedly did not like the painting; his daughter, Louise, thought it transformed her father from a [...] "great lord" [...] to a [...] "fat farmer".|$|E

500|$|On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL {{championship}} {{football games}} which were followed {{the day after}} with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL, Steelers ownership {{made the decision to}} re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid overtop the [...] Desso GrassMaster surface. The field's condition was exacerbated by 1½inches of rain after the new sod had been laid, which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began. The field conditions during the game ended up being so bad that at one point during the game, a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon Fields ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing. The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17seconds remaining in regulation; it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943. Scott Brown, of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a [...] "veritable mud pit". While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league. Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions [...] "horrendous" [...] after the game. However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> to keep the grass." [...] Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following Thanksgiving on the road at the team's request.|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry.

Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?"
