5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged {{his son in}} the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{to the extent that}} he constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{retained}} an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{and when}} Sillitoe suggested {{to the editor}} of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E

5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|At the school, Crawford was {{influenced}} by his housemaster, F. B. Malim, {{who presided over the}} archaeological section of the college's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> It is possible that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford. With the society, Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge, West Kennet Long Barrow, Avebury, and Martinsell. It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape, allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts' home. He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull's Copse, thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake, who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire. Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle, being vegetarians and social reformers, and their ideas had a strong impact on Crawford. Under the Peakes' influence, Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world-view based in science. Crawford gained an appreciation from Peake for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape rather than simply through texts or artefacts.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing {{as part of a}} dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than hers.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

25|$|This {{question}} is {{of special interest}} to philosophers of physics, as physicists continue to show a strong <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> They usually consider an interpretation of quantum mechanics as {{an interpretation of the}} mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, specifying the physical meaning of the mathematical entities of the theory.|$|E
25|$|In May 1864 Gladstone {{said that}} he saw no reason in {{principle}} why all mentally able men could not be enfranchised, but admitted that this would only come about once the working classes themselves showed more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Queen Victoria was not pleased with this statement, and an outraged Palmerston considered it seditious incitement to agitation.|$|E

25|$|Building crystal radios was a craze in the 1920s, {{and again}} in the 1950s. Recently, hobbyists have started {{designing}} and building examples of the early instruments. Much effort goes into the visual appearance of these sets as well as their performance. Annual crystal radio 'DX' contests (long distance reception) and building contests allow these set owners to compete with each other and form a community of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
25|$|Waugh opined on {{many and}} various topics.

Waugh noted that, although he had no great <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> {{he lived in a}} house which had a well sunk through 70ft (21 m) of rock on nothing more than the advice of a dowser.|$|E

25|$|Most states use {{the term}} eminent domain, but some U.S. states {{use the term}} {{appropriation}} (New York) or expropriation (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.
