25|$|A {{parabolic}} dome is {{a unique}} structure in which bending stress due to the uniformly <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> of its dead load is zero. Hence it was widely used in buildings in ancient times, {{before the advent of}} composite structures. However, if a point load is applied on the apex of a parabolic dome, the bending stress becomes infinite. Hence it is found in most ancient structures, the apex of the dome is stiffened or the shape modified to avoid the infinite stress.|$|E

Since a <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> varies the shear load according to its magnitude it can be derived that the slope of the shear diagram is equal to the magnitude of the <b>distributed</b> <b>load.</b> The relationship between <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> and shear force magnitude is: ...|$|E

40|$|Typically, beams {{that form}} part of {{structural}} systems are subjected to vertical <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> along their length. <b>Distributed</b> <b>loading</b> affects moment and shear distribution, and consequently spread of inelasticity, along the beam length. However, the finite element models developed so far for seismic analysis of frame structures either ignore the effect of vertical <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> on spread of inelasticity or consider it in an approximate manner. In this paper, a beam-type finite element is developed, which is capable of considering accurately the effect of uniform <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> on spreading of inelastic deformations along the beam length. The proposed model consists of two gradual spread inelasticity sub-elements accounting explicitly for inelastic flexural and shear response. Following this approach, the effect of <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> on spreading of inelastic flexural and shear deformations is properly taken into account. The finite element is implemented in the seismic analysis of plane frame structures with beam members controlled either by flexure or shear. It is shown that to obtain accurate results the influence of <b>distributed</b> beam <b>loading</b> on spreading of inelastic deformations {{should be taken into}} account in the inelastic seismic analysis of frame structures...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} find {{the effect of a}} <b>distributed</b> <b>load,</b> the {{designer}} can integrate an influence line, found using a point load, over the affected distance of the structure. For example, if a three-foot-long track acts between 5 feet and 8 feet along a beam, the influence line of that beam must be integrated between 5 and 8 feet. The integration of the influence line gives the effect that would be felt if the <b>distributed</b> <b>load</b> had a unit magnitude. Therefore, after integrating, the designer must still scale the results to get the actual effect of the <b>distributed</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} a multi-material {{composite}} wedge under a normal and shear loading at its external faces is considered with a variable separable solution. The stress and displacement fields are determined using the equilibrium conditions for forces and moments and the appropriate Airy stress function. The infinite isotropic wedge under shear and normal <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> along its external faces is examined for different values of the order n of the radial coordinate r. The proposed solution {{is applied to the}} elastostatic {{problem of a}} composite isotropic k-materials infinite wedge under <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> along its external faces. Applications are made {{in the case of the}} two-materials composite wedge under linearly <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> along its external faces and in the case of a three-materials composite wedge under a parabolically <b>distributed</b> <b>loading</b> along its external faces.

The critical value of the energy density factor can then be used for determining the allowable load on a specimen with a crack front not perpendicular to the tensile axis...|$|R
