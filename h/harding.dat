5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had <b>Harding</b> being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. <b>Harding</b> biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that <b>Harding</b> went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that <b>Harding</b> was there. <b>Harding</b> was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920 {{election}} campaign, Taft {{supported the}} Republican ticket, <b>Harding</b> (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge; they were elected. Taft {{was among those}} asked {{to come to the}} president-elect's home in Marion, Ohio to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920. By Taft's later account, after some conversation, <b>Harding</b> casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court, for if Taft would, <b>Harding</b> would put him there. Taft had a condition for Harding: that having been president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could only accept the chief justiceship. <b>Harding</b> made no response, and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House. In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that <b>Harding</b> planned to appoint him, if given the chance.|$|E

5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. <b>Harding,</b> Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the <b>Harding</b> administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption {{in the view of}} the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed <b>Harding,</b> as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the <b>Harding</b> administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the <b>Harding</b> Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as <b>Harding.</b>|$|E

Blacks blamed <b>Harding</b> for the Dyer bill's defeat; <b>Harding</b> biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E

5|$|<b>Harding</b> {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White <b>Harding,</b> who had become a partner three years earlier. William <b>Harding</b> changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. <b>Harding,</b> in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but <b>Harding</b> wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harding</b> {{spoke and}} {{voted in favor}} of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, <b>Harding</b> argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. <b>Harding</b> voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, <b>Harding,</b> less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E

5|$|In early 1903, <b>Harding</b> {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that <b>Harding</b> was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, <b>Harding</b> sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and <b>Harding</b> were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and <b>Harding</b> won by overwhelming margins.|$|E

NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, <b>Harding</b> got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, <b>Harding</b> visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June.

5|$|Six {{months after}} The Inquirer was founded, with {{competition}} from eight established daily newspapers, {{lack of funds}} forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette associate editor Jesper <b>Harding.</b> After <b>Harding</b> acquired The Pennsylvania Inquirer, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under <b>Harding,</b> in 1829, The Inquirer moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When <b>Harding</b> bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The Inquirer again was moved, this time to its own building {{at the corner of}} Third Street and Carter's Alley. <b>Harding</b> expanded The Inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, <b>Harding</b> gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount.

A shocked <b>Harding,</b> who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. <b>Harding</b> did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923.
