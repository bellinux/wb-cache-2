50|$|Castilleja levisecta is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the figwort family known by the common name <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush,</b> or golden Indian paintbrush, listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1997. It is native to British Columbia and Washington, where it is known from eleven remaining populations. It occurred in Oregon but all natural occurrences there have been extirpated. It has been reintroduced to a few areas in Oregon, but {{it remains to be}} seen if the plants will survive. The plant is a federally listed endangered species of Canada and was listed as threatened in the United States in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Castilleja levisecta (<b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush)</b> {{was first}} {{collected}} near Mill Plain, Washington, by Thomas Jefferson Howell in 1880 and {{was described by}} Jesse More Greenman in 1898 (Greenman 1898). This is a perennial herb growing in clumps of up to fifteen stems. The leaves are green, containing chlorophyll to undergo photosynthesis, but like other Castilleja it is a hemiparasite, capable of tapping the roots of other plants to obtain nutrients and water. The inflorescence contains bright golden yellow bracts with small green flowers tucked between them. It is the only Castilleja with yellow bracts within its range in the Pacific Northwest. The plant {{is thought to be}} pollinated by bumblebees, including Bombus californicus. The species is nearly self-incompatible, and a plant produces many more seeds when crossed with a less closely related individual, such as a plant from a separate population.|$|E
40|$|Our {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to better understand}} how to increase the success rates of recovery plantings of a rare hemiparasite, <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> (Castilleja levisecta-Orobanchaceae). This species is endemic to western Washington and Oregon, USA, and southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Over 5000 <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> plants were outplanted as plugs in 2007 at six different native prairie sites that {{were considered to be}} suitable habitat, based on general evaluations of vegetation and soil conditions. Outplantings were installed at regular intervals along transects up to 1 km long to include a range of conditions occurring at each site. All plantings were re-examined five years later. The patchy distribution of surviving plugs and new recruits within each reintroduction site suggested success is strongly influenced by microsite characteristics. Indicator species analysis of taxa growing in microsites around outplanted <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> identified species that were positively or negatively associated with paintbrush survival. Species such as Festuca roemeri, Eriophyllum lanatum, and Viola adunca were strong indicators at some sites; non-natives such as Hypochaeris radicata and Teesdalia nudicaulis tended to be frequent negative indicators. Overall, higher richness of native perennial forbs was strongly correlated with both survival and flowering of <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush,</b> a pattern that may reflect interactions of this hemiparasite with the immediately surrounding plant community. Topographic position also influenced outcomes, with greater survival occurring on mounds and in swales, where soils generally were deeper. Our findings suggest that assessments of site suitability based on vegetation alone, and coarser, site-level assessments that do not characterize heterogeneity at the microsite scale, may not be strong predictors of restoration success over the longer term and in sites with variability in vegetation and soils. By identifying suitable microsites to focus rare species plantings, survival and efficiency may be significantly enhanced...|$|E
40|$|They {{have been}} {{described}} as “nearly impossible to cultivate in a garden ” (Art 1990), with “many problems associated with growing them from seed ” (Borland 1994). Castilleja species are historically a notorious, even mysterious, group of plants to propagate, eluding growers for years. These false allegations arise principally because of the parasitic nature of the genus. Species of Castilleja are hemiparasites, benefiting from but not requiring a companion host species in order to successfully establish themselves in a garden setting. Nevertheless, successful germination and seedling establishment do not require the presence of a host species. We have successfully grown more than 3000 individuals of <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> (Castilleja levisecta), an endangered perennial endemic to the Pacific Northwest, for restoration purposes. To facilitate propagation of common Castilleja species by wildflower enthusiasts, we here share our experiences growing this rare beauty. Castilleja is a charismatic and colorful genus commonly known as “Indian paintbrush ” or “painted cup, ” {{and is a member of}} the figwort family (Scrophulariaceae).

40|$|The {{recovery}} plan for Castilleja levisecta, or <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush,</b> calls for twenty populations {{of at least}} 1000 plants on protected land (USFWS 2000 b), and {{for the creation of}} a reintroduction plan. Reintroduction, in this case, is used broadly to refer to three distinct activities within the historic range of the species: reintroducing plants to sites from which they were formerly known, introducing plants to suitable sites within the historic range for which we have no evidence of past populations, and augmenting current populations to increase the population and/or its genetic diversity. There are now eleven known extant populations of Castilleja levisecta. Half of these populations have less than 1000 plants, and only four populations are considered stable or possibly stable. Reintroduction will be a critical part of the recovery of C. levisecta. This document identifies the objectives, strategic and managerial considerations, the site election process, genetic and demographic considerations, ecological considerations, and technical considerations to be considered in the reintroduction process. Appendices include seed collection guidelines, recommendations from the genetic analysis, soils analysis of known sites, the site selection process, and suggested research prior to largescal...|$|E
30|$|To {{elucidate}} {{relationships between}} fire intensity, severity, and effects, we collected data from five different prescribed burns, conducted on five prairies owned by county, state, and non-profit {{agencies in the}} South Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The five sites were Glacial Heritage Preserve (46 ° 53 ′ 37.32 ″ N, 123 ° 3 ′ 8.64 ″ W), Tenalquot Preserve (46 ° 53 ′ 50.6394 ″ N, 122 ° 43 ″ 53.0394 ″ W), Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve (46 ° 52 ′ 13.7994 ″ N, 123 ° 2 ′ 25.44 ″ W), Scatter Creek Wildlife Area (46 ° 50 ′ 20.76 ″ N, 122 ° 59 ′ 37.32 ″ W), and West Rocky Wildlife Area (46 ° 53 ′ 33.36 ″ N, 122 ° 52 ′ 11.2794 ″ W). All five prairies have similar glacial outwash soils (Spanaway, or Nisqually, or both soil types) and similar management goals, but are at different stages in the restoration process. All prairies have been actively managed to reduce the cover of invasive species, recover native forbs and bunchgrasses, and act as reintroduction sites for rare species such as the Taylor’s checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha taylori [W.H. Edwards 1888]; state endangered, federally endangered) and <b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> (Castilleja levisecta Greenm; state endangered, federally threatened). Prescribed burns have occurred annually across different sections of all prairies since 2001, creating slightly different fire histories in each unit. The goal for these sites is to eventually achieve a fire return interval of 2 yr to 5 yr for any given patch of prairie. The burns evaluated for this study took place between 15 August and 15 September over two years (2011 and 2012) and were characterized as having either predominantly low or moderate severity.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Castilleja levisecta (<b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush)</b> {{is one of}} Washington's {{characteristic}} endangered species, {{restricted to}} the Pacific Northwest's disappearing prairies. To establish new populations, C. levisecta was seeded into restoration plots with other prairie natives including a closely related but more common Castilleja, C. hispida. Together these two Castilleja species could provide host plants for the Taylor's checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha taylori), another endangered prairie species. However, suspicion of the two Castilleja species hybridizing in the wild if their populations overlap has led to confirmation of viable hand-crossed hybrids. Maintaining genetic separation of the two species is a high priority. This field investigation was conducted to determine the potential to hybridize via natural pollinators, and how the growing-context of the plants affects their reproduction. Analyzing the reproductive characteristics and the seeds of plants from plots with both Castilleja species and from plots with each grown alone, as well as pure-bred off-site controls, indicate the species differ in their flower and seed production, with C. levisecta having higher fitness than C. hispida in this study, as well differing in seed germination and their sensitivity to context differences. C. levisecta reproduction was more inhibited by growth with C. hispida and pollinators showed no preference between the species. The restoration site quality also influenced Castilleja reproduction, partly due to decreased pollinator activity. Analysis of the produced F 1 generation from control (single-species) contexts and mixed-species contexts, using pollen and flower characteristics indicate a similar pattern of context-effect on Castilleja reproduction. The growing context of the species and site characteristics were found to influence Castilleja reproduction and increase the occurrence of hybrids when growing within a 40 square meter plot. Analyzing the reproductive characteristics identified distinguishing flower measurements for each species, particularly their proportions of bract lobing and galea beak proportions, {{as well as the}} angle of the flowers from the stem. Their pollen viabilities also indicate C. levisecta may have lower male fecundity than C. hispida, with hybrids having further decreased viability. A relatively small proportion of hybrid offspring were identified from mixed-species growing contexts, and with a higher incidence in one species' offspring than the other...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Pacific Northwest prairies {{have become}} {{significantly}} reduced in extent, {{and in the}} Willamette Valley of Oregon, {{less than one percent}} of native upland prairies remain. Many species have been impacted by this extreme loss of habitat, including Castilleja levisecta (<b>golden</b> <b>paintbrush),</b> a threatened hemiparasitic forb species endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Many of the prairie fragments that remain are poor quality, and face the threat of invasion from non-native species and a loss of biodiversity. These non-native species pose an obstacle to restoration and to the reintroduction of threatened and endangered species. Nutrient enrichment has been shown to promote increased invasion of communities, decrease success of native species, and decrease biodiversity. A way to counter these effects is through carbon addition to the soil which stimulates microbial activity and immobilizes nutrients, making them unavailable to plants. This strategy has potential as a restoration tool to improve conditions for native species, which are often outcompeted under high nutrient conditions. We tested the efficacy of carbon addition for controlling non-native species and restoring C. levisecta in two Willamette Valley prairies. We created treatments of varying nutrient availability and measured the responses of the plant community and of C. levisecta. Experimental plots were established in autumn 2012 with either carbon (sucrose) addition, ambient soil nutrients (controls), or nutrient addition (NPK fertilizer). Nutrient treatments were reapplied throughout the length of the experiment. Crossed with these treatments in a fully factorial design were seeding treatments of C. levisecta and of thirteen other native species, to increase the diversity of the plant community, providing host plants for C. levisecta, a hemiparasitic plant. In the two growing seasons following treatment we conducted plant community surveys and counted and measured seedlings of C. levisecta to determine the effects of the nutrient manipulations and seeding treatments on the community overall and on this threatened plant. Community composition differed significantly between the different nutrient treatments (perMANOVA, p< 0. 001) at both study sites, and in both years of the experiment. Mean total vascular plant cover was significantly reduced by carbon addition compared to ambient nutrient availability, and increased by nutrient addition. Native grasses were unaffected by nutrient manipulation at either site, whereas non-native grasses were greatly reduced by carbon addition and increased by nutrient addition, compared to ambient soil nutrient availability. Non-native forbs were also greatly reduced by carbon addition, and were also reduced by nutrient addition by the second year of the experiment. Richness of non-native species was more affected by nutrient manipulation than richness of natives, and was either increased or unaffected by nutrient enrichment and decreased by carbon addition. Some non-native species were found to be highly affected by the nutrient manipulation, while others were not, suggesting that carbon addition may be an effective control for only certain non-native species. At both sites, C. levisecta emergence was lower in carbon addition plots compared with controls. In nutrient addition plots, C. levisecta emergence was higher at one site but lower at the other compared with controls, suggesting that nutrient addition may be beneficial only under certain conditions. Additionally, by the second year of the experiment, there was no difference in C. levisecta numbers between the control and nutrient addition plots at one site, and there were fewer in the nutrient addition plots than in controls at the other site. The seeding of additional native species increased community richness but had little effect on diversity and no effect on C. levisecta establishment. Overall, these results suggest that nutrient enrichment can promote the success of non-native species and that carbon addition can be used to counter these effects on a species- and site-specific basis. However, carbon addition did not improve reintroduction success of a threatened plant species, C. levisecta, and the effects of nutrient addition on its success after two years were mixed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 <b>Golden</b> <b>paintbrush</b> (Castilleja levisecta Greenman) {{historically}} {{inhabited the}} prairies of the Willamette Valley, Oregon. However, this Pacific Northwest endemic is currently restricted to eleven {{sites in the}} Puget Trough of Washington and British Columbia. Recovery criteria call {{for the establishment of}} new populations throughout the species historic range, including the Willamette Valley. In order to facilitate reintroduction to this region, we examined: (1) habitat characteristics of potential C. levisecta recovery sites in the Willamette Valley and compared them to remaining populations in the Puget Trough, (2) a suite of ecological and genetic factors likely to contribute to reintroduction success using common garden experiments, and (3) how the performance of this rare hemiparasite was affected by the availability of different host combinations in the greenhouse and in the field. Potential C. levisecta reintroduction sites in the Willamette Valley had distinct vegetation communities and soil characteristics compared with remaining populations in the Puget Trough. This disparity was likely related to regional differences in geology, climate, ocean proximity, and land-use history. Many of the species indicative of remaining populations in the Puget Trough were native pereimials, while those of potential reintroduction sites in the Willamette Valley were introduced annuals. Soil characteristics of C. levisecta sites were also distinct among the two ecoregions. Puget Trough sites were located on sandy soils with generally high levels of magnesium and sulfur, while Willamette Valley sites were found on silty-clay soils with high concentrations of potassium and phosphorous. Differences in soil texture, and magnesium and potassium concentrations were associated with plant community divergence among the two regions. Decisions regarding seed source and recovery site selection are especially difficult in portions of a species range that are uninhabited, as no reference populations exist with which to compare ecological information. Using common garden experiments, we tested hypotheses about how C. levisecta transplants would perform in relation to the ecological similarity between seed source and introduction site, the effective population size and genetic diversity of seed sources, and the habitat quality of the recovery site. We observed significant variation in performance measures among source populations and common garden sites. Plant community characteristics, including the abundance of nonnative species and the similarity in community structure between source populations and common garden sites, helped explain the variation in these performance measures. Exotic species cover at common garden sites was associated with a reduction in performance of first year C. levisecta transplants. Survival of second year transplants increased with increasing similarity in plant functional groups between source and common garden sites, supporting the idea of a "home-habitat advantage. " These results indicate that high quality prairies, dominated by native perennial species with low nonnative abundance, should be targeted for recovery sites. We recommend using plant material from Whidbey Island, WA, whose three populations represented in our study consistently performed well. Rare, parasitic plants pose an interesting challenge to restoration practitioners. We examined how the performance of C. levisecta was affected by the availability of different host combinations in the greenhouse and in the field. Castilleja levisecta individuals were grown with two grass individuals (Festuca roemeri; Poaceae), two non-grass hosts (Eriophyllum lanatum; Asteraceae), one individual of each of these species, or without a host. Our greenhouse results provide little support for the complimentary diet hypothesis, which states that parasites grown with multiple host species perform better than individuals grown alone or with a single host. Castilleja levisecta individuals grown with two different species performed better than those co-planted only with F. roemeri, but did not differ from E. lanatum or no-host treatments. In the field, vole activity had indirect effects on C. levisecta survival mediated through host species. Vole tunneling and C. levisecta mortality were strongly associated with host treatments including E. lanatum. Field survival was significantly higher among no-host C. levisecta individuals than those grown with E. lanatum or mixed host treatments. We do not suggest coplanting C. levisecta with E. lanatum in the field. Although no-host C. levisecta individuals had the greatest first year field survival, we suspect that perennial host plants will be beneficial to future survival. Therefore, we recommend planting C. levisecta in the Willamette Valley, OR with F. roemeri...|$|E
