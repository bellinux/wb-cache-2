His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E

25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up and remove the trapped slag by reheating, softening the slag and then squeezing <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, refining is needed for the cast iron produced in the blast furnace. By re-melting the cast iron in an open hearth, the carbon is oxidized and removed from the iron. Liquid slag is formed and removed in this process.|$|E

That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strong position of Missionary Ridge.

25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and take her to a hospital ("Fantine's Arrest").|$|E
25|$|Parma {{then slipped}} back to eighteenth {{position}} after an Edinson Cavani brace saw Napoli comfortably overcome a Parma side without a win since {{the opening day}} of the season, which led to president Tommaso Ghirardi demanding improvement. Parma then beat Sampdoria at home in thick fog and A.S. Bari away by a solitary goal to nil to shoot up to fourteenth position and ease pressure on Marino, the latter including a wonderful goal from Antonio Candreva. Parma secured a respectable draw at home to early season pace-setters Lazio the next week as ex-Lazio star Hernán Crespo opened the scoring for Parma, netting his 65th league goal for the club, before Luca Antonelli's own goal cancelled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stroke of half-time. Next up were reigning champions Internazionale who beat Parma by five goals to two, overcoming an early Hernán Crespo brace, who was again scoring against former employers. The Argentinian striker was again on the scoresheet the following week as former manager Francesco Guidolin returned to Il Tardini {{for the first time since}} his summer departure, opening the scoring from the penalty spot with 24 minutes played before Udinese's Antonio Di Natale equalised 11 minutes later. Crespo then put his team back in front for good early in the second half as Parma won 2-1 and scoring his 150th Serie goal. The following week, Parma travelled to Palermo and took the lead inside ten minutes as Alessandro Lucarelli found the net. Parma then surrendered their lead and three second half goals from the Rosanero were enough to see Parma off and the match finished 3–1. The Ducali rounded off their pre-Christmas schedule with home match against rivals Bologna, who proved to be stubborn opposition in a goalless draw.|$|E

500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. John Kubicek of BuddyTV {{called it}} [...] "easily my favorite {{episode of the}} past two seasons, and quite possibly one of the best episodes the show has ever made". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide described it and the episode that followed, [...] "Nationals", as [...] "clever, funny and filled with moments that felt like little gifts to the fans who have hung in there". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan's [...] "strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small-town teenagers who'll never get anything but to sweat <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets of a runaway American dream"; he gave [...] "Props" [...] a [...] "B" [...] grade.

Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan {{half an hour to}} solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

[...] Sam Lansky of Idolator praised the performance, writing that [...] "Mars turned <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, with an energetic rendition of 'Locked Out of Heaven' backed by a fleet of impeccably choreographed dancers." [...] A live performance was also done on The X Factor UK, on November 25, 2012. On December 4, Mars performed on the [...] Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, aired on CBS. His performance happened during the Calendar Girls. On the December 8, 2012, Mars performed in the 2012 edition of Jingle Bell Ball at The O2 Arena in London.

2500|$|On 29 February 1892 Penley {{produced}} the farce Charley's Aunt at the Theatre Royal, Bury St. Edmunds, {{appearing in the}} role of Lord Fancourt Babberley (who reluctantly impersonates a rich widow from Brazil). Brandon Thomas wrote the play as a vehicle for Penley; later the two disagreed (and went to court) about how much, if any, of the plot was Penley's invention rather than Thomas's. [...] Penley told a journalist in 1894, [...] "The play was my idea and Brandon Thomas wrote it. [...] Later on, we went down into the country and worked at it. [...] Then we worked <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage." [...] The provincial production was a success, and Penley then {{produced the}} play in London at the Royalty in December 1892, after which it transferred to the larger Globe in 1893. Charley's Aunt became an unprecedented hit, running for 1,466 performances in London, a record that lasted for decades. The original run finally ended in December 1896, but the play was revived several times. The Times commented that it was probable that although the [...] "long runs filled his pockets, [...] broke his strength". Penley's last new role was as the eccentric Lord Markham, in the comedy A Little Ray of Sunshine, by Mark Ambient and Wilton Heriot, in which he toured from May 1898 and opened at the Royalty in January 1899.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1974 Split Enz {{undertook}} {{a series of}} radio-sponsored [...] "Buck-A-Head" [...] ($1 per head entry) shows which played in theatres rather than in pubs or clubs. Taking advantage of this, Phil and Tim decided that, rather than slogging <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traditional pub circuit, they would now only perform in theatres and concert halls, which were better suited to the band's unique performance style and enabled them to stage a full theatrical presentation. Under Noel Crombie's guidance the band developed elaborate sets, costumes, hairstyles and makeup, [...] and performances were punctuated by odd happenings. At one concert, they brought Rayner's auntie on stage to perform an impromptu tap dance {{during one of the}} songs and this was a great success, but they realised that they couldn't really take her on tour with them, so it Crombie's spoon playing routine was substituted and soon became an essential part of each show. For an early NZ TV performance with a [...] "desert island" [...] theme they brought in a load of sand and created a miniature indoor beach, complete with palm trees and a wading pool, with band members dressed as hankie-hatted tourists, reclining on deck chairs and sipping drinks. For another now-legendary live performance of their live epic [...] "Stranger Than Fiction", a female friend was recruited to crawl across the stage during the song, under pulsing strobe lights, with a bloodied axe apparently embedded in her skull.|$|E
2500|$|Fertig even {{created a}} 'navy' by arming several small {{merchant}} vessels {{which he used}} to protect convoys of small vessels that helped distribute supplies brought in by submarine. These vessels also attacked Japanese shipping, primarily small inter-coastal vessels and patrol boats. The USFIP navy was armed with various machine guns salvaged off downed bombers, home-made cannons and even mortars. Later some used 20mm cannons supplied by the U.S. Navy. One vessel was even 'armored' using large, circular forestry saws taken from abandoned plantations. Some of the actions these vessels participated in were heroic to the extreme, as when one small vessel deliberately engaged in a running battle with a large Japanese steamer, and another, a sailing ship armed with 20mm cannon, fought off Japanese aircraft and actually shot one down, perhaps establishing a record for being the only sailing ship to shoot down an airplane—a Japanese Mitsubishi medium bomber. More importantly, the crew salvaged a new Japanese bomb sight from the wreckage and sent <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next submarine to Australia. One of Fertig's most audacious ship captains was Waldo Neveling, a German civilian, soldier of fortune and an [...] "enemy alien" [...] Fertig had commissioned into the U.S. Army. Another ship, called The Bastard, was actually a 26-foot whaleboat captained by Australian Robert [...] "Jock" [...] McLaren, an escaped prisoner-of-war from the Sandakan POW camp on Borneo. McLaren would sail his boat into Japanese controlled ports in broad daylight, shoot up the supply vessels and piers with machine guns and a mortar, then turn tail and run.|$|E
