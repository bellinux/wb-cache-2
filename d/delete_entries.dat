Entries that <b>delete</b> <b>entries</b> may only be provided in the delete phase. In either phase, add entries (including adds that represent all current attributes of modified entries) can be returned. At {{the end of a}} present phase, each entry that the consumer has that was not identified in an add entry or present response during the present phase is implicitly no longer in the provider and thus must be deleted at the consumer so as to synchronize the consumer with the provider.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{solution}} of the optimal assignment problem can be obtained as the limit of the solution of an entropy maximization problem, as a deformation parameter tends to infinity. This allows us to apply entropy maximization algorithms to the optimal assignment problem. In particular, the Sinkhorn algorithm leads to a parallelizable method, {{which can be used}} as a preprocessing to handle large dense optimal assignment problems. This parallel preprocessing allows one to <b>delete</b> <b>entries</b> which do not belong to optimal permutations, leading to a reduced instance which becomes solvable with limited memory requirements.

In the process, information about each spectrum {{and a low}} resolution copy of each spectrum is being saved into an on-line database. FTSDBM is a simple database management program in the NSO external package for IRAF. A command language allows the FTSDBM user to add entries to the database, <b>delete</b> <b>entries,</b> select subsets from the database based on keyword values including ranges of values, create new database files based on these subsets, make keyword lists, examine low resolution spectra graphically, and make disk number/file number lists.

40|$|Idea {{processors}} are {{computer programs}} that can aid the user in creating outlines {{by allowing the}} user to move, reorder, renumber, expand upon, or <b>delete</b> <b>entries</b> with a push of a button. The question is whether these programs are useful and should be offered to students. Theoretically, an idea processor prioritizes ideas by placing them in a hierarchy. Unf'rtunately, the idea processor does not really set priorities; it attaches labels indicating priorities that the writer has set. The confusion is between labels or symbols (which are on paper or in the computer) and ideas (which are in the head). The basic limitations of the idea processor are that (1) the meaning of an item on a list is not stable, and (2) the appropriate symbol for the meaning must change when {{any of the things}} the item depends on change. Three things need to be adjusted when a program command is used: the idea of what the item means, the idea of wha...|$|E

30|$|Application layer. The {{application}} layer can only interact with file system through a POSIX-compliant interface. A user-level application can securely erase {{all the data}} on the storage medium by invoking a secure erase command (Incits: Scsi storage interfaces 2016; Team work systems: Advanced technology attachment 2017) in the hardware controller’ interface. A few files overwriting tools, e.g, srm (Jagdmann 2015) and wipe (Durak 2006), {{can be used to}} securely remove files. Gracewipe (Zhao and Mannan 2015), as has been discussed in “PDE for desktop computers” section, can achieve secure and verifiable deletion of encryption keys through a special deletion password by taking advantage of TPM and Intel TXT, thus making the encrypted data permanently inaccessible. In the case of database, there is also a secure deletion interface, which can be used to overwrite data with zeros in the underlying file system. For MySQL, (Stahlberg et al. 2007) proposed an approach to <b>delete</b> <b>entries</b> by overwriting them with zeros, and the transaction log is encrypted and can be securely disposed by deleting the encryption key. For SQLite (SQLite: Pragma statements 2017), there is a compile-time option to enable a secure deletion feature that overwrites deleted records with zeros.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that <b>deleted</b> <b>entries</b> of the Microsoft Windows {{registry}} (keys) may still reside in the system files once the <b>entries</b> have been <b>deleted</b> from the active database. Investigating the complete keys in context may be extremely important from both a Forensic Investigation point of view and a legal point of view where a lack of context can bring doubt to an argument. In this paper we formalise the registry behaviour and show how a retrieved value may not maintain a relation to the part of the registry it belonged to and hence lose that context. We define registry orphans and elaborate on how they can be created inadvertently during software uninstallation and other system processes. We analyse the orphans and attempt to reconstruct them automatically. We adopt a data mining approach and introduce a set of attributes that can be applied by the forensic investigator to match values to their parents. The heuristics are encoded in a Decision Tree that can discriminate between keys and select those which most likely owned a particular orphan value. </p...|$|R
