2500|$|The steam-powered <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> {{replaced}} the trip hammer (at {{least for the}} largest forgings). [...] James Nasmyth invented it in 1839 and patented in 1842.

2500|$|If {{a column}} is loaded {{suddenly}} {{and then the}} load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a <b>drop</b> <b>hammer.</b> The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (free) end and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than {{the length of the}} rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically-loaded column. The critical condition for buckling amplitude to remain less than about 25 times the effective rod straightness imperfection at the buckle wavelength is ...|$|E

[...] The hammer fall created Nebraska's Missouri River breaks. [...] Barada was still angry and slammed his fist down on a pile. [...] It was driven so far into the soil that it pierced a water table. [...] Legend says that all of Nebraska would have flooded from this bung hole if Antoine Barada hadn't plugged it by sitting over it.

50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: <b>drop</b> <b>hammers,</b> diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air <b>hammers.</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>hammers</b> simply <b>drop</b> a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|R
