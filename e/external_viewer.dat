2500|$|In the book, five {{distinct}} [...] "mono-dialogues", a term Loevy himself used {{in personal}} correspondence, {{are used to}} tell the story of the family to an assumed listening partner, who is neither seen nor heard. Each of these mono-dialogues is different, and given by different people in different languages or period-appropriate forms of Hebrew. Loevy captured this in the film, creating a new television vocabulary. The [...] "mono-dialogue" [...] technique eliminated the [...] "fourth wall" [...] taboo of television and film, according to which the audience absolves itself of traditional neutrality and assumes the role of a character in the story. In Loevy's own words, [...] "Television demands text, but the television viewer is used to getting the complete text. Every question has an answer...." [...] In Mr. Mani, the role of respondent is filled by the camera and, by extension, the audience itself. [...] "As soon as the speaker turns to the camera—in other words, to the audience, speaking directly to it in a way that demands an answer, it is as if the speaker stepped out of the screen, almost like in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. The viewer is shaken up. The artificial nature of the situation itself in Mr. Mani screams its presence.".

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{representations of}} women and children in South African films about HIV and AIDS, paying particular attention to issues relating to the advancement and empowerment of the two groups. The dissertation focuses on two films: Yesterday (Darrell Roodt, 2004) and Life Above All (Oliver Schmitz, 2010). These two films represent marginalised communities and identities. Yesterday focuses on the experiences of rural women, while Life Above All focuses on women and children living in a small town on the urban periphery. In order to contextualise the two films as well as the textual and theoretical analysis found {{in the body of the}} dissertation, the first chapter provides a brief outline of some of the concerns regarding the representations {{of women and}} children in South African films about HIV and AIDS. These concerns include the debate surrounding the authenticity of the representations of poor, black women by male, middle-class, white filmmakers, as well as the authenticity of the representations of children by adult filmmakers. Chapter 2 provides additional contextual information by defining and considering the various concepts and theories on which the study is built. These include the naturalist, humanist and pluralist methods of representing HIV/AIDS, as well as the semiotic and discursive approaches to analysing audio-visual texts. Chapter 3 consists of a close textual analysis of Yesterday. The chapter problematises representations that place too much emphasis on marginal communities‘ need for external help. It argues that the film‘s focus on generating sympathy from <b>external</b> <b>viewers</b> with the 2 hope that they might be persuaded to help women like the film‘s main character, Yesterday, hinders the promotion of empowerment. Chapter 4 critically analyses the representation of children in Life Above All, with special attention paid to self-development and agency. This chapter argues that the film neglects children‘s self-development and long-term empowerment by placing too much value on the virtues of selfless sacrifice. Chapter 5 concludes that the use of stereotypes and the prioritisation of easy to understand educational information and narratives in South African films about HIV/AIDS hinder a deeper understanding of identities as well as the promotion of women‘s and children‘s empowerment. Effective collaboration between filmmakers and the represented groups would lead to representations of identities that are more truthful to the complexities of the experiences of those infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS. In addition, I argue that increased participation of female filmmakers would lead to more diversified representations of women‘s and children‘s identities and experiences...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{research}} is necessary; {{not only to}} further {{our understanding of the}} processes of life, but also to combat disease, hunger and environmental damage. Bioinformatics is the science of handling biological information. It entails integrating, structuring and analysing the ever-increasing amounts of available biological data. In practise it means using computers to analyse huge amounts of very complicated data taken from a field that is only partially understood, to see the hidden trends and connections, and to draw useful conclusions. My thesis work has mainly concerned the study of protein families, which are groups of evolutionarily related proteins. I have analysed known protein families and created predictive models for them, and developed algorithms for defining new protein families. My principal techniques have been sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMM). To aid my work, I have written a lot of software, including MSAView, a visualiser for multiple sequence alignments (MSA). In this thesis, the protein family of inorganic pyrophosphatases (H+-PPases) is studied, as well as the two protein superfamilies BRICHOS and MDR (medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases). The H+-PPases are tightly membrane bound, proton pumping, dimeric enzymes with ~ 700 -residue subunits and found in bacteria, plants and eukaryotic parasites, and which use pyrophosphate as an alternative to ATP. The BRICHOS superfamily is only present in higher eukaryotes, but encompasses at least 8 protein families {{with a wide range of}} functions and disease associations, such as respiratory distress syndrome, dementia and cancer. The sequences are typically ~ 200 residues with even shorter functional forms. Finally, MDR, is a large and complex protein superfamily; it currently has over 16000 members, it is present in all kingdoms of life, the pairwise sequence identity is typically around 25 %, the chain lengths vary as does the oligomericity, and the members are partaking in a multitude of biological processes. The member families include the classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), quinone reductase, leukotriene B 4 dehydrogenase, and many more forms. There are at least 25 human MDR genes excluding close homologues. There are HMMs available for detecting MDR superfamily membership, but none for the individual families. For the H+-PPase family, we characterised member sequences found using an HMM of a conserved 57 -residue region thought to form part of the active site. This region was found to contain two highly conserved nonapeptides, mainly consisting of the four “very early” residues Gly, Ala, Val and Asp, compatible with an ancient origin of the family. The two patterns have charged amino acid residues at positions 1, 5 and 9, are apparent binding sites for the substrate and parts of the active site, and were shown to be so specific for these enzymes that they can be used for automated annotation of new sequences. For the BRICHOS superfamily, we were able to find three previously unknown member families; group A, which may be ancestral to the ITM 2 families (integral membrane protein 2); group B, which is a close relative to the gastrokine families, and group C, which appears to be a truly novel, disjoint BRICHOS family. The C-terminal region of group C has nearly identical sequences in all species ranging from fish to man and is seemingly unique to this family, indicating critical functional or structural properties. For the MDR superfamily, we characterised and built stable HMMs for 17 member families using an empiric approach. From our experiences we were able to develop an algorithm for automated HMM refinement that uses relationships in data to produce stable and reliable classifiers, and we used it to produce HMMs for 86 distinct MDR families. We have made the program freely available and it can be readily applied to other protein families. We also developed a web site ([URL] that makes our findings directly useful also for non-bioinformaticians. In our analyses of the 86 families, we found that MDR forms with 2 Zn 2 + ions in general are dehydrogenases, while MDR forms with no Zn 2 + in general are reductases. Furthermore, in Bacteria, MDRs without Zn 2 + are more frequent than those with Zn 2 +, while the opposite is true for eukaryotic MDRs, indicating that Zn 2 + has been recruited into the MDR superfamily after the initial life kingdom separations. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) play a central part in most work on protein families, and are integral to many bioinformatic methods. With the ongoing explosive increase of available sequence data, the scales of bioinformatic projects are growing, and efficient and human-friendly data visualisation becomes increasingly challenging, but is still essential for making new interpretations and discovering unexpected properties of the data. Ideally, visualisation should be comprehensive and detailed, and never distract with irrelevant information. It needs to offer natural and responsive ways of exploring the data, as well as provide consistent views in order to facilitate comparisons between datasets. I therefore developed MSAView, which is a fast, modular, configurable and extensible package for analysing and visualising MSAs and sequence features. It has a graphical user interface and a powerful command line client, and can be imported as a package into any Python program. It has a plugin architecture and a user extendable preset library. It can integrate and display data from online sources and launch <b>external</b> <b>viewers</b> for showing additional details. It also includes two new conservation measures; alignment divergences, which indicate atypical residues or deletions, and sequence conformances, which highlight sequences that differ from their siblings at crucial positions. In conclusion, this thesis details my work in analysing two protein superfamilies and one protein family using bioinformatic methods; developing an algorithm for automated generation of stable and reliable HMMs, as well as a new conservation measure, and a software platform for working with aligned sequences...|$|R
