5|$|Hurricane <b>Darby</b> was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, <b>Darby</b> originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July2016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July11, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm <b>Darby</b> the next day. Further intensification ensued, and <b>Darby</b> became a hurricane on July13. Over the next three days, <b>Darby</b> slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused <b>Darby</b> to weaken {{over the next three}} days, although <b>Darby</b> managed to restrengthen slightly on July21 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July24 (UTC; 2:00p.m. on July23 HST), <b>Darby</b> made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick <b>Darby,</b> who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but <b>Darby</b> declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that <b>Darby</b> had any involvement with the murder, but accused <b>Darby</b> of having lied about the 1824 meeting. <b>Darby</b> denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|Tracking {{steadily}} west-northwestward {{along the}} southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, <b>Darby</b> continued to intensify albeit at a slower rate due to its proximity to dry air. On July15, <b>Darby</b> became a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Despite decreasing ocean temperatures, <b>Darby</b> intensified further to attain winds of 105mph (165km/h). Strengthening was no longer expected as <b>Darby</b> moved over sea temperatures of less than 79°F (26°C), but on July16, <b>Darby</b> managed to develop an annular structure. Convection became more symmetric, outer rainbands dissipated, and the 25mile-wide (35km) eye became increasingly well defined. <b>Darby</b> reached its peak intensity as a Category3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). However, twelve hours later, <b>Darby</b> weakened back to a Category2 hurricane as convection deteriorated. Embedded in cool sinking air and moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, <b>Darby</b> began a gradual weakening trend, degrading to a Category1 hurricane by July18. Despite warming cloud tops, <b>Darby</b> exhibited a well-defined circulation and a ragged eye feature, remaining a minimal hurricane {{through the rest of}} the day. However, <b>Darby</b> finally weakened to a tropical storm on July19. <b>Darby</b> continued to degrade as it crossed 140°W into the Central Pacific, and entered the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) on July20 with winds of 60mph (95km/h).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the <b>Darby</b> Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the <b>Darby</b> Creek Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for {{riparian}} restoration on <b>Darby</b> Creek. Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the <b>Darby</b> Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The <b>Darby</b> Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|A warrant {{was sworn}} out for Waring's arrest, but {{officials}} {{soon learned that}} he was incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When <b>Darby</b> discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to Simpson County where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told <b>Darby</b> that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished <b>Darby</b> with a letter that contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Darby</b> {{approached}} Hawaii on July21, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued for Hawaii County and Maui County. These were modified to tropical storm warnings by noon the next day. A tropical storm watch was issued for Oahu late on July22 as <b>Darby</b> continued to move closer to Hawaii, and was modified to {{a tropical storm}} warning the next morning. Eventually, after <b>Darby</b> made landfall in Kaʻū District in the afternoon of July23, the tropical storm warning was extended to all islands {{in the state of}} Hawaii. The watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as <b>Darby</b> weakened and moved away from the islands, with none remaining by July25.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick <b>Darby</b> by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated.

5|$|<b>Darby</b> {{eventually}} brought {{suit for}} libel against Kendall and Eliza Sharp, {{as well as}} Senator Beauchamp and Sharp's brother Leander. Numerous delays and changes of venue prevented any of the suits from ever going to trial. <b>Darby</b> died in December 1829.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck Pennsylvania. Upper <b>Darby</b> Township {{received}} seven {{inches of}} rainfall, causing massive flooding in <b>Darby</b> Creek. Forty-three homes were deemed uninhabitable in <b>Darby</b> and were {{purchased by the}} Borough. They were demolished in 2000 and the open space was converted into John Bartram Memorial Park {{in honor of the}} botanist and <b>Darby</b> native. In Springfield Township, Rolling Green Park was expanded when six homes were ravaged by the hurricane and had to be demolished.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, <b>Darby</b> turned west-southwestwards as it {{continued}} to weaken, but the shear diminished slightly on July21, allowing <b>Darby</b> to restrengthen to winds of 65mph (100km/h). The reprieve was short-lived, however, as an approaching upper-level low once again increased shear over the system the next day. <b>Darby</b> began to curve back to the west on July23 as it approached a weakness in the aforementioned subtropical ridge, all the while weakening slowly. Just after 00:00UTC on July24 (2:00p.m.HST on July23), <b>Darby</b> made landfall on the Big Island {{near the village of}} Pahala in the Kaʻū District, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). This marked only the fifth time that a tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or higher made landfall on one of the major islands in the state of Hawaii since record keeping began in 1949, with the others being an unnamed tropical storm in 1958, Hurricane Dot in 1959, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, and Tropical Storm Iselle in 2014. After crossing the Big Island, <b>Darby</b> began to accelerate northwestwards in earnest while maintaining as a minimal tropical storm. On July25, <b>Darby</b> weakened into a depression, and degenerated into a remnant low the next day 265mi (425km) west-northwest of Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|The first Europeans {{to come to}} {{the area}} in the {{vicinity}} of <b>Darby</b> Creek were the Dutch, though they did not establish any permanent settlements. In 1643, Swedish colonists led by Johan Printz established New Sweden near the confluence of <b>Darby</b> Creek and the Delaware River. The settlement they established served as the seat of government for the Swedes in North America for 12 years. They may have built impoundments in the creek to isolate marsh areas. Dutch settlers conquered the Swedish villages in 1655. In 1664, the Dutch surrendered the <b>Darby</b> Creek drainage basin to the English, who began settling the area after William Penn was issued a charter in 1681. The <b>Darby</b> Creek Ferry House, near the site of Printz's headquarters, was erected in 1694.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Darby</b> was {{the first}} Eastern Pacific major {{hurricane}} since Hurricane Kenna in 2002. The sixth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, <b>Darby</b> developed from a tropical wave {{that emerged from the}} west coast of Africa on July 12. After crossing into the Eastern Pacific, the storm became a tropical depression on June 26. The system steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on 000 UTC July 28. <b>Darby</b> peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, though it quickly deteriorated due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear. While <b>Darby</b> dissipated on August 1, the remnants of the tropical cyclone affected the Hawaiian Islands. The system produced high waves and heavy rainfall that led to extensive flash flooding. Numerous roads were closed, while minor landslides and rockslides were reported. Despite the effects, no fatalities or severe damages occurred.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Darby</b> was {{the fourth}} named storm of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane}} season. The origins of <b>Darby</b> were from a tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm remained well offshore, although it killed three people.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} a couple of {{attempts}} to locate a [...] "source" [...] for <b>Darby's</b> concept of the Rapture — the belief that a core of Christian believers who have died will be raised from the dead, and believers who are still alive and remain shall be [...] "caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" [...] (...) in conjunction with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Some of these attempts imply that <b>Darby's</b> concepts originated from a [...] "false" [...] source. Samuel Prideaux Tregelles alleged that The concept was taken from one of the charismatic utterances in Edward Irving's church. Since Tregelles regarded the utterances as [...] "pretending to be from God," [...] his implication is that <b>Darby's</b> rapture is from a demonic source. Dave MacPherson built upon Tregelles's accusation, and claimed that the source for <b>Darby's</b> rapture was from an Margaret MacDonald's 1830 vision of the end times.|$|R
