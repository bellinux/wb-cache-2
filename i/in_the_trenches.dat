40|$|Microstructure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> damascene {{interconnects}} evolves {{with the}} overburden layer, an excessive metal layer over <b>trenches.</b> We present <b>the</b> results of three-dimensional simulation, which show {{the effects of}} overburden thickness on mi-crostructure evolution <b>in</b> a <b>trench.</b> When <b>the</b> thickness of the overburden {{is less than half}} of <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> depth, for a <b>trench</b> with <b>the</b> aspect ratio of unity, <b>the</b> microstructure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> tends to evolve into a bamboo structure. This effect is discussed in terms of grain sizes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> and those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> over-burden. The thinner overburden layer would have smaller grains, of which growth is limited by its thickness. Such small-sized grains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overburden are not likely to grow into <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> which hardly make grain boundaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> Meanwhile, <b>the</b> grains from <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> are able to continue growth inside <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> resulting <b>in</b> a bamboo structure. Overburden thickness af-fects the reliability and the electrical performance of the damascene copper in-terconnects. Optimization of overburden thickness is required to minimize these effects...|$|R

50|$|Fighting {{trenches}} {{were usually}} about 12 ft deep. Trenches were never straight but were dug in a zigzagging or stepped pattern.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of normally incident time-periodic water waves with a density-stratified fluid in a rectangular trench is studied experimentally and theoretically; the fluid outside <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> is homogeneous. This investigation {{has focused on}} the excitation of internal waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> by surface waves, and the effects of the internal oscillations on the waves on the free surface. The study shows that, when the frequency of the incoming surface waves corresponds to the natural frequency of oscillation of <b>the</b> internal waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench,</b> <b>the</b> amplitude of the internal waves becomes large compared to the amplitude of the surface waves. The effects of the internal waves on the surface waves were very small <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiments. A two-layer model and a three-layer model are developed and applied to a particular constant-depth channel and <b>trench</b> configuration used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiments. The two-layer model is also applied to a rectangular trench in an infinite region. These models treat steady-state wave motions of infinitesimal amplitude for all ranges of fluid depth relative to the wavelength of the surface waves, and include a vigorous treatment of the effects of energy dissipation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laminar boundary layers adjacent to the solid surfaces and at <b>the</b> density interface. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two-layer model <b>the</b> stratified fluid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> is represented by two homogeneous fluids of different densities; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-layer model these two fluids are separated in between by a transition region of linear density variation. Fresh water and salt water were used to model density stratification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiments. The effects of surface wave amplitude and density distribution on <b>the</b> internal motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> were investigated for small density differences compared to the density of water. A new technique using a scanning laser beam and detect or system was developed to measure internal wave amplitudes. Satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions was obtained. The effects of nonlinearity and viscous dissipation on the internal motions were more pronounced when the depth of the heavier fluid was small compared to the wavelength of <b>the</b> internal waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> For a trench in an infinite region, the two-layer model also predicts that large surface wave reflections occur when <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> is "at internal resonance," and {{a significant portion of the}} incident wave energy can be dissipated within <b>the</b> <b>trench.</b> <b>The</b> investigation has provided insight with regard to both the dynamics of wave-trench interaction and the design of navigation channels in density-stratified fluids for reducing the potential of wave-induced internal resonance...|$|R
40|$|The southernmost {{portion of}} the Macquarie Ridge Complex (MRC) {{comprises}} <b>the</b> Hjort Ridge, <b>Trench,</b> and Plateau, <b>the</b> topographic expression of the Australian-Pacific plate boundary south of New Zealand. On the basis of marine geophysical (swath bathymetry/reflectivity, seismic reflection, gravity, magnetic) data, teleseismic data, and gravity modeling, we argue that the Australian plate is actively underthrusting the Pacific plate along <b>the</b> Hjort <b>Trench,</b> but self-sustaining subduction does not yet appear to have commenced. We interpret a crustal discontinuity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trench</b> as a shallowly dipping thrust splay off a sub-vertical transform fault <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crest of the Hjort Ridge (Hjort Fault). The Hjort Fault separates oceanic crust generated at the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR crust), located to the south, from oceanic crust generated at the extinct Australian-Pacific spreading center located to the north (MRC crust). Oblique convergence on the transform has initiated a significant plate boundary decollement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trench,</b> but our estimate of ? 50 km of underthrusting {{does not support the}} existence of an eastwardly dipping Australian slab below ? 20 km depth. For the length of the Hjort Ridge and Trench system, oblique convergence is partitioned between <b>the</b> decollement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trench</b> and <b>the</b> Hjort Fault. South of 57. 5 °S, <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> decollement accommodates thrusting. North of 57. 5 °S, the boundary-parallel component of convergence becomes dominant, <b>the</b> <b>Trench</b> gradually shallows, and <b>the</b> <b>trench</b> decollement evolves into a low-angle, oblique-slip fault. <b>The</b> <b>trench</b> decollement and strike-slip system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hjort Ridge are structural boundaries that contain tectonic slivers of inferred SEIR crust of the western flank of the Hjort Ridge that currently belong to neither the Australian nor the Pacific plate...|$|R
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trenches</b> were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
