5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a <b>fourfold</b> fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird.

5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a <b>fourfold</b> increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E

40|$|We isolate a {{class of}} smooth {{rational}} cubic <b>fourfolds</b> X containing a plane whose associated quadric surface bundle {{does not have a}} rational section. This is equivalent to the nontriviality of the Brauer class of the even Clifford algebra over the K 3 surface S of degree 2 arising from X. Specifically, we show that in the moduli space of cubic <b>fourfolds,</b> the intersection of divisors C_ 8 and C_ 14 has five irreducible components. In the component corresponding to the existence of a tangent conic to the sextic degeneration curve of the quadric bundle, we prove that the general member is both pfaffian and has nontrivial Brauer class.

5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than <b>fourfold</b> increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we study the quantum periods {{together}} with their Picard–Fuchs differential equations of Calabi–Yau <b>fourfolds.</b> In contrast to Calabi–Yau threefolds, we argue that the large volume points of Calabi–Yau <b>fourfolds</b> generically are regular singular points of the Picard–Fuchs operators of non-maximally unipotent monodromy. We demonstrate this property in explicit examples of Calabi–Yau <b>fourfolds</b> with a single Kähler modulus. For these examples we construct integral quantum periods and study their global properties in the quantum Kähler moduli space {{with the help of}} numerical analytic continuation techniques. Furthermore, we determine their genus zero Gromov–Witten invariants, their Klemm–Pandharipande meeting invariants, and their genus one BPS invariants. In our computations we emphasize the features attributed to the non-maximally unipotent monodromy property. For instance, it implies the existence of integral quantum periods that at large volume are purely worldsheet instanton generated. To verify our results, we also present intersection theory techniques to enumerate lines with a marked point on complete intersection Calabi–Yau <b>fourfolds</b> in Grassmannian varieties...|$|R
