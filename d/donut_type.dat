Generally, the {{reinforced}} concrete slab has great fire resistance performance because concrete has excellent thermal material properties under fire. But, {{in the case}} of hollow slab, it will be expected that hollow slabs have different temperature distribution and fire endurance performance compare to {{reinforced concrete}} slab. Because hollow slab has internal void space that occurs decreasing regenerative effect of concrete and formation of internal air layer. Evaluation method for fire resistance performance of hollow slabs was proposed using wickström’s method. For the casual use of evaluation, simplified method was proposed which was limited to solid slab and <b>donut</b> <b>type</b> hollow slab which was developed by authors of this research paper. Also, verification on proposed method was performed by comparing results of fire experiment for hollow slab and evaluation results. Proposed method of {{the results of this study}} was possible to predict the residual strength and temperature distribution of slabs under fire...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the shear capacities of biaxial hollow slab with <b>donut</b> <b>type</b> hollow sphere. Recently, {{various types of}} slab systems which can reduce self-weight of slabs have been studied as {{the height and width}} of building structures rapidly increase. A biaxial hollow slab system is widely {{known as one of the}} effective slab system which can reduce self-weight of slab. According to previous studies, the hollow slab had low shear strength, compared with solid slab and the shear capacities of biaxial hollow slab are influenced by the shapes and materials of hollow spheres. In addition, the present code does not provide a clear computation method for the shear strength of hollow slab. To verify the shear capacities of this hollow slab, shear tests were performed. Four test specimens were used for test parameters. One was conventional RC slab and others were hollow slabs. The test parameters included two different shapes and materials of plastic balls. The shape parameters were donut and non-donut forms. And the material parameters were general plastic and glass fiber plasti...|$|E
50|$|A {{doughnut}} or <b>donut</b> is a <b>type</b> {{of fried}} dough confectionery or dessert food. The doughnut is popular {{in many countries}} and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets. They are usually deep-fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or without a hole and often filled.|$|R

They are usually sweet, deep-fried from a flour dough, and shaped in rings or flattened spheres that sometimes contain fillings. The doughnut has a long history, supposedly a Dutch creation exported to New Amsterdam (present-day New York City) in the 1600s under the Dutch name of olykoeks—"oily cakes".

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to identify consumer attitude toward all kinds of donut atribute which made from wheat flour and mocaf; and to compare consumer attitude toward all types of  subtitution phase of donut. The respondents of {{this research}} were 45 respondents which accidentally taken from the buyers.   The method {{of this research}} was eksperimental with the object were donut with 30 % and 50 % mocaf substitution ingredients and without mocaf substitution as a control. The data was gained in March 2015. Fishbein model was used to identify consumer’s attitude toward donut attribute which consist of taste, tekstur, shape, size, colour, and price; whereas Friedman test was used  to compare consumers attitude toward <b>donut</b> with all <b>types</b> of substitution. The result of this research were showed that taste attribute and tekstur attribute was more considered in choosing donut product; and {{there was no significant difference}} in consumer attitude toward donut with mocaf substitution. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and flight evaluation of an advanced composite empennage component is presented. The recommended concept for the covers is graphite-epoxy hats bonded to a graphite-epoxy skin. The hat flare-out has been eliminated, instead the hat is continuous into the joint. The recommended concept for the spars is graphite-epoxy caps and {{a hybrid of}} Kevlar- 49 and graphite-epoxy in the spar web. The spar cap, spar web stiffeners for attaching the ribs, and intermediate stiffeners are planned to be fabricated as a unit. Access hole in the web will be reinforced with a <b>donut</b> <b>type,</b> zero degree graphite-epoxy wound reinforcement. The miniwich design concept in the upper three ribs originally proposed is changed to a graphite-epoxy stiffened solid laminate design concept. The recommended configuration for the lower seven ribs remains as graphite-epoxy caps with aluminum cruciform diagonals. The indicated weight saving for the current advanced composite vertical fin configuration is 20. 2 % including a 24 lb growth allowance. The project production cost saving is approximately 1 % based on a cumulative average of 250 aircraft and including only material, production labor, and quality assurance costs...|$|E
30|$|The {{studies of}} voided slab {{systems that have}} been carried out have focused on the {{development}} of anchoring methods and devices, shape of void formers for optimal void ratio, structural performance, such as shear and flexural capacity, and shear reinforcement. Considering the aspect of structural performance, voided slab systems are vulnerable to shear capacity, when compared to solid slabs (Aldejohann and Schnellenbach-Held 2002; Hegger et al. 2009; Jung et al. 2016; Miwa et al. 1995; Chung et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011). Schnellenbach-Held and Pfeffer (2002) found that while the so-called control perimeter is treated as a shear resistance section in flat slab designs, the shear area within the bubble-containing voided slab could be reduced. Chung et al. (2009) indicated that the shapes of the void formers might be crucial factors that determine the capacities of the shear forces in voided slab systems. They maintained that donut-shaped void formers could resist approximately 20 % more shear strength over other shapes of void formers. Lee et al. (2011) performed experimental studies to evaluate the punching shear of two-way voided slab-to-column connections with TVS lightweight balls. Along with the shear resistance performance of the voided slab system, various studies have also attempted to evaluate the flexural performance of the voided slab. Many studies have confirmed that the flexural capacities of the voided slab are similar in performance to the solid slab system for equal depth (Chung et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2014). Chung et al. (2013) demonstrated that two-way slab systems with <b>donut</b> <b>type</b> void formers showed similar flexural capacities, when compared with the conventional reinforced concrete slabs.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{population}} of dusky Canada geese (Branta canadensis occidentalis; hereafter, dusky geese) nesting {{on the western}} Copper River Delta (CRD) in south- central Alaska has been in decline since the late 1970 s. In an effort to alleviate mammalian predation, increase nest success, and avoid a listing under the U. S. Endangered Species Act, an artificial nest island (island) program was implemented on the western CRD in 1983. The installation of new islands on the CRD is the sole management action of the Pacific Flyway Council on the breeding grounds, but no comprehensive evaluation of {{the program has been}} published. I examined general trends in island use and nest success over time for three island <b>types</b> (<b>donut</b> islands, fiberglass floater islands, and sandbag islands) from 1984 - 2005. I used data from the island program to identify factors associated with dusky Canada goose nesting (hereafter, use) and nest success on islands from 1996 - 2005. I generated a series of candidate models and used logistic regression with model selection techniques to determine how variables representing pond characteristics, vegetative characteristics, interactions with conspecifics and larid species, the previous year’s island status, and the distance to predator corridors were associated with island use and nest success for each year. Use of islands by dusky geese nesting on the western CRD increased between 1987 and 2005 from a low of 10...|$|R
