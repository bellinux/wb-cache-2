40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{operational}} performance of luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> during the financial crisis of 2008 and the following recession. In addition, the study aims to provide insights on the relatively unstudied industry of luxury goods. The operational performance of luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> is further evaluated by comparing their key financial performance indicators against a benchmark group consisting of premium <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> in order to find whether the luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> show outperformance during the recession. A regression analysis is conducted to gain further insight on the factors that potentially affect the results. The sample consists of a hand-collected data set of 20 publicly traded global luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> and a peer group of 20 public premium <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> also operating globally. For the purposes of this study, the luxury goods industry is limited to the so- called personal luxury goods or luxury consumer goods. The financial data is gathered from Thomson One Banker and the companies financial statements, covering a time period from year-end 2007 to year-end 2010, covering the full economic down cycle: slowdown, recession and rebound. The main findings of this study support the set hypotheses regarding luxury goods companies' performance during the financial crisis and the following economic downturn. While luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> were not found to be immune to the recession, their performance was on aggregate positive despite the hostile operating environment. In addition, the positive performance was significantly better when compared to the peer group, which suggests that luxury <b>goods</b> <b>companies</b> indeed outperform their premium peers. Finally, the variables contributing to this performance were measured with sales growth, financial flexibility and initial profitability and were controlled for size. The findings of the multivariate analysis suggest that initial profitability and size are negatively associated with the performance while other variables suggest a positive association with the outperformance...|$|R

500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft in <b>good</b> <b>company,</b> with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".|$|E
500|$|Another early {{influence}} was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams's words, [...] "It was now that Holst discovered {{the feeling of}} unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a great teacher. A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." [...] At Kelmscott House, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its <b>good</b> <b>company</b> and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, [...] "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according {{to the amount of}} money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, [...] "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." [...] He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.|$|E
