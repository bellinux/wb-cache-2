5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. In 2004, the discovery of a microscopic diamond in the U.S. led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana. The Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is open to the public, and is the only mine in the world where members of the public can <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> diamonds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces (370t) of gold were removed {{in the first five}} years of the Gold Rush (worth over US$16billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E

5|$|The race {{starts in}} Port Town, with the winners {{traveling}} {{in a boat}} to a large desert. Legend has it that four stone tablets are buried somewhere in the desert, and the contestants are sent out to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> them {{and bring them to}} the Viscount. According to the stone tablets, the actual location of the Crystal is hidden somewhere on the ancient map. Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches the map. As the two struggle for the map, the map is torn to shreds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 {{there were}} just 11 people living on the island {{but it was not}} long before the island farms expanded. In the 1850s gold was {{discovered}} on mainland Australia where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> gold than to risk a life at sea. As a consequence many vessels avoided the mainland and Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were living on the island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon – even grapes, passionfruit and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853 there were several aborted proposals by the NSW Government to establish a penal settlement on the island.|$|E

5|$|In the ground, they <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a <b>Dig</b> <b>for</b> Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> food in the soil of the villages' terraced pastures.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the gold}} in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams. However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners {{graduated}} to more complex placer mining. Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> gold in the newly exposed river bottom.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 1829, the Georgia legislature, {{enacted a}} series of laws which confiscated a large section of Cherokee land, nullified Cherokee law within the confiscated area, banned further {{meetings}} of the Cherokee government in Georgia, declared contracts between Indians and whites null and void unless witnessed by two whites, disallowed Indians from testifying against a white person in court and forbade Cherokee to <b>dig</b> <b>for</b> gold on their own lands. The laws were made effective June 1, 1830. These were calculated to force the Cherokee to move.|$|E
25|$|To the {{south-west}} of the town, {{beside the}} York to Scarborough railway line, is an ornamental lake known as Scarborough Mere.

Since the late 1990s the Mere has been redesigned as a natural space for picnics, fishing and walkers. In 2012 a new snack bar was built alongside the Mere. The lake {{is now part of}} the Oliver's Mount Country Park and the Hispaniola now sails out of Scarborough harbour during the summer season.|$|E
