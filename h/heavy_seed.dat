A genetic study of populations in Eneabba showed that over 5% of plants had originated up to [...] away (similar rates to Banksia hookeriana, the seed of which only weighs half as much). The mechanism for this is unclear, although Byron Lamont has proposed the short-billed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) as a vector; the species seeks out Banksia attenuata cones after bushfire, possibly because the large seeds and greater chance of grubs in the cone make them more nutritious. Flowering has been recorded one to two years after a bushfire.|$|E
500|$|... 232Th is a {{primordial}} nuclide, having {{existed in}} its current form for over ten billion years; it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r-process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovae. The letter [...] "r" [...] stands for [...] "rapid neutron capture", and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> nuclei such as 56Fe rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the neutron drip line, as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased Coulomb barriers that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56Fe is endothermic. Because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium, because all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.|$|E

Each flower, in size like a small coffee-cup, would open out in a white mass and shed its scores of silvery balls, and these when freed of <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> would float aloft in the wind, and the whole air as far as one could see would be filled with millions and myriads of floating balls. The fallen seed was so abundant as to cover the ground under the dead but still standing plants. It is a long, slender seed, {{about the size of}} a grain of Carolina rice, of a greenish or bluish-grey colour, spotted with black. The sheep feasted on it, using their mobile and extensible upper lips like a crumb-brush to gather it into their mouths. Horses gathered it in the same way, but the cattle were out of it, either because they could not learn the trick, or because their lips and tongues cannot be used to gather a crumb-like food. Pigs, however, flourished on it, and to birds, domestic and wild, it was even more than to the mammals.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z > 6 is still a major {{challenge}} for theoretical models. If it starts from black hole (BH) remnants of Population III stars (light seeds with mass ~ 100 Msun) it requires super-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> formed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10 ^ 5 Msun BH. Here we investigate the relative role of light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> as BH progenitors of the first SMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z > 6 quasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> in the progenitor galaxies, {{we find that the}} formation of a few <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> (between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth of SMBHs at z > 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the conditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas (Z Jcr). We find that <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> can not form if dust cooling triggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D > Dcr). In addition, the relative importance of light and <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> depends on the adopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of cold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.

Seeds from the northern portion of coast Douglas-fir's range tend to be larger than seed from the south.|$|E
40|$|Seed {{weight is}} a crucial plant life history trait, {{determining}} establishment success and dispersal ability. Especially in stressful environments, larger seeds may be selected {{at the expense of}} seed number, because larger seeds {{have a better chance of}} giving rise to an established offspring. We tested the hypotheses that between related species-pairs and among populations of single species a similar trend for increasing seed weight with increasing altitude should be present. Firstly, we measured seed weights from 29 species-pairs, with one species occurring in lowland areas and a congeneric species from high altitudes. Seeds of the alpine species were 28 +/- 8 % larger than seeds from lowland species (P > 0. 01). Compared to the related lowland species, 55 % of the alpine species had <b>heavier</b> <b>seeds,</b> 3 % (one species) had lighter, and 41 % had seeds of approximately equal weight. Secondly, we compared seed weights among populations of four species from different habitats and with different life histories. Seeds from between 11 and 34 populations per species were sampled along altitudinal gradients of 800 - 1, 500 m (ca. 800 m in Scabiosa lucida, ca. 1, 000 m in Saxifraga oppositifolia, ca. 1, 000 m in Epilobium fleischeri, and ca. 1, 500 m in Carex flacca). In all the four species, we found no indication for <b>heavier</b> <b>seeds</b> at higher altitudes. Our results indicate a selection pressure for species with <b>heavier</b> <b>seeds</b> at higher altitude, but the trend does not seem to operate across all cases. Phylogenetic constraints may limit the correlation among altitude and seed weight, operating particularly against selection for larger seed size, the closer populations and species are related to each other...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature and}} origin of the first super-massive black holes at redshift larger than 5 {{by means of an}} improved version of the semi analytical model GAMETE/QSOdust. In this study, we model the formation of the progenitors (seeds) of the first super-massive black holes along host galaxies hierarchical assembly. Low-mass seed black holes (~ 100 Msun) form as remnants of massive (260 - 300 Msun), population III stars, the so-called light seeds, while intermediate mass black holes (10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 Msun), the so-called <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds,</b> arise from the direct collapse of gas in metal poor (Z<Zcr) halos exposed to a strong H 2 photo-dissociating Lyman Werner flux.

50|$|This process {{entails a}} {{succession}} of rapid neutron captures (hence the name) by <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> nuclei, typically beginning with 56Fe. The captures must be rapid {{in the sense that}} the nucleus does not have time to undergo radioactive decay before another neutron arrives to be captured. The r-process therefore occurs in locations where there is a high flux of free neutrons. These include the material ejected from a core-collapse supernovae (as part of supernova nucleosynthesis) and neutron-rich matter thrown off from a neutron star merger. The relative contributions of these, and other, sources to the astrophysical abundance of r-process elements is a matter of ongoing research.|$|E

When a new fire or other disturbance occurs that opens up the ground to light again, the seeds germinate. Some areas with <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> counts in the soil can, after burning, be covered with pure dense stands of this species and when in flower the landscape is turned into fields of color.|$|E

However, seed coat thickness did not impede or delay germination as germination percentage was higher in <b>heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> (which had thicker coats) and the mean germination time was not significantly different across the seed weight classes. Similar findings have been observed in Oenothera biennis L (Gross and Kromer 1986), Diplotaxis erucoides (L.) DC. and D. virgata (Cav.) DC. (Perez-Garcia et al. 1995). Barnett (1997) observed that 69 % of the variation in the speed of germination in five pine species was related to the seed coat. In the present study, germination percentage was positively correlated with seed weight. This finding is similar to that reported in Artocarpus heterophyllus L., Alangium lamarckii Thwaites, Quercus semiserrata Roxb. and other oak species (Khan 2004; Ahirwar 2012; Barik et al. 1996; Bonfil 1998; Tripathi and Khan 1990; Khan and Shankar 2001). <b>Heavy</b> <b>seeds</b> are associated with greater stocks of food and energy reserves and provide readily available energy and resources to stimulate germination (Flint and Palmblad 1978).|$|R
30|$|Application {{of higher}} {{concentrations}} of FPH gave better {{results in the}} generative parameters, even though the effect is not statistically significant. The data indicated that the application of 5  mL/L FPH yielded relatively longer pods, <b>heavier</b> <b>seeds,</b> and higher yields compared to the control. This might be because higher concentration of FPHs can provide higher nutrients to the soil to be absorbed by the plant. At this dosage, FPH gave comparable results to the commercial liquid fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer.|$|R

The <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> crop and high germination rate contributes to its invasiveness in North America, where it forms dense monotypic stands that choke out native vegetation. It is one of the few introduced species that can successfully invade and colonize a virgin forest.

5000|$|Miconia trees can flower {{several times}} a year and bear fruit simultaneously. The inflorescences are large panicles of white to light pink blossoms.

A young tree with only two flower panicles can produce [...] seeds in its first fruiting season. This <b>heavy</b> <b>seed</b> production and potential for long-distance dispersal help make miconia an invasive threat. The seeds can lie dormant in the soil of the forest for more than 12 years, and whenever a break in the canopy allows sun to shine through to a patch of soil the seeds there undergo germination. Once the plants grow to full height, their enormous leaves shade out all the space below them, preventing any other plant from growing nearby.

Furthermore, neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were still being enriched by the decay of extinct plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of extinct 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
