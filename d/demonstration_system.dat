5|$|The first (and only) {{production}} model (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR as a <b>demonstration</b> <b>system</b> in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 processors and a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM {{proved to be}} problematic. It was also discovered that the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, {{one of the four}} CPUs was not running reliably.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Civil Aviation {{has decided}} to {{implement}} an indigenous Satellite-Based Regional GPS Augmentation System also known as Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) {{as part of the}} Satellite-Based Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS)/Air Traffic Management (ATM) plan for civil aviation. The Indian SBAS system has been given an acronym GAGAN – GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation. A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of Technology <b>Demonstration</b> <b>System</b> (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept has been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Centre (MCC) located near Bangalore.|$|E

This would act as a <b>demonstration</b> <b>system</b> for other transit operators considering buying the trains. In exchange, the government agreed to pay for any cost overruns over the original LRT costs. The [...] six-station Scarborough RT line opened in March 1985.|$|E

40|$|In the future, robots {{will enter}} our {{everyday}} lives {{to help us with}} various tasks. For a complete integration and cooperation with humans, these robots {{need to be able to}} acquire new skills. Sensor capabilities for navigation in real human environments and intelligent interaction with humans are some of the key challenges. Learning by <b>demonstration</b> <b>systems</b> focus on the problem of human robot interaction, and let the human teach the robot by demonstrating the task using his own hands. In this thesis, we present a solution to a subproblem within the learning by demonstration field, namely human-robot grasp mapping. Robot grasping of objects in a home or office environment is challenging problem. Programming by <b>demonstration</b> <b>systems,</b> can give important skills for aiding the robot in the grasping task. The thesis presents two techniques for human-robot grasp mapping, direct robot imitation from human demonstrator and intelligent grasp imitation. I...|$|R

Examples of each from <b>demonstration</b> <b>systems</b> are presented. 1...|$|R
