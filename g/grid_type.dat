40|$|In this paper, two <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> are {{discussed}} {{for the use}} as interstage 1 - 2 structure of the Veículo Lançador de Microssatélites (VLM). VLM is a launcher for microsatellites made of 3 stages arranged in tandem. The interstage 1 - 2 is an open grid structure because of the hot separation of the first stage. The grid is made of light yet stiff carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The two discussed <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> for the interstage are the axial grid and the hoop grid. The axial grid consists of axial stiffeners, which are parallel to the axis of the launcher, and helical stiffeners arranged at a +θ angle and at a – θ angle. The hoop grid is made of hoop stiffeners which are circular and helical stiffeners {{similar to those of}} the axial grid. The mechanical behavior of interstages made of these two <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> is discussed with respect to stiffness and stability. Finite element modelling (FEM) is used to determine the influence of the grid components on the eigenfrequency of the launcher. In this analysis, the stiffeners of the interstage are smeared into a cylindrical shell and implemented into a shell element model of VLM. The net thickness of the smeared stiffeners is varied to determine the influence of each stiffener type on the modal analysis. The smeared stiffeners are then discretized into individual stiffeners and the resulting gird barrels are analyzed via FEM using beam elements to determine the stability behavior of the grids. Here the influence of the width to thickness ratio of the stiffeners having rectangular cross sections is inspected. Having established an understanding of the mechanical behavior of the two grids, an interstage design for both <b>grid</b> <b>types</b> is developed using the above described analyses. It is found that the minimum mass of the axial grid interstage, which fulfils the stiffness and stability requirements, is lighter than the hoop grid interstage...|$|R

A larger number of grid blocks (or smaller size of each grid block) make the algorithm to be slower with the increasing computational load.

Grid selection is, therefore, problem dependent, and will, therefore, be discussed separately for the case studies investigated.|$|R

Firstly the base-line grid of the Rotor to Casing <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> was used to obtain CFD results. A grid independent solution was obtained for this base-line grid.

A set of successively refined Casing to Rotor <b>grid</b> <b>type</b> was tested by increasing the density of nodes on the rotor profile in the interlobe leakage region.
