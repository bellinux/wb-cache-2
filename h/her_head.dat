Another witness said she saw the man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against a wall.|$|E

5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having <b>her</b> <b>head</b> shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have <b>her</b> <b>head</b> shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|Persis Khambatta as Ilia, the Deltan {{navigator}} of the Enterprise. Khambatta {{was originally}} {{cast in the}} role when The Motion Picture was a television pilot.

TNA then {{announced}} a TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal {{to determine the}} number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at Sacrifice on the April 24 episode of Impact!. The match involved two stages, with the second being a ladder match between the final two competitors. The winner of that stage would become number one contender while the loser would have their head shaved bald. Gail Kim won immunity from having <b>her</b> <b>head</b> shaven on the May 8 episode of Impact!. Kim {{went on to win the}} contest, while Laveaux had <b>her</b> <b>head</b> shaven.|$|E

5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{nurse was}} due to arrive at 9:00 the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, {{she moved}} to Amsterdam to {{interview}} Dutch anarchists in the Provo countercultural movement. While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin. Soon after they were married, she said, de Bruin began to abuse her severely, punching and kicking her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging <b>her</b> <b>head</b> against the floor until he knocked her unconscious.|$|E

5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist texts {{recount the}} birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also {{appeared}} in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the Mahasiddha princess Lakshminkara, cut off <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.|$|E

5|$|By {{tradition}} dated {{back to the}} Byzantine era, {{the king}} was regarded by the Church as part of <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> On the issue of Church's Autocephaly and his role as king within the Church, Otto was overwhelmed by the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism (while the Queen was Protestant).|$|E
5|$|Euryale– A Gorgon {{and former}} {{servant of the}} Sisters of Fate. Euryale sought revenge against Kratos for killing her sister Medusa, but was killed and decapitated; as with Medusa, Kratos took <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{to use it as}} a weapon to turn enemies to stone.
