A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

[...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you.
