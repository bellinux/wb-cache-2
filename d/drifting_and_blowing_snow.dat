40|$|The {{redistribution}} of snow by <b>drifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> frequently {{leads to an}} inhomogeneous snow mass distribution on larger ice caps. Together with the thermodynamic impact of drifting snow sublimation on the lower atmospheric boundary layer, these processes affect the glacier surface mass balance. This study provides a first quantification of snowdrift and sublimation of blowing and drifting snow on the Vestfonna ice cap (Svalbard) by using the specifically designed snow 2 blow snowdrift model. The model is forced by atmospheric fields from the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting model and resolves processes on a spatial resolution of 250 m. The model {{is applied to the}} Vestfonna ice cap for the accumulation period 2008 / 2009. Comparison with radio-echo soundings and snow-pit measurements show that important local-scale processes are resolved by the model and the overall snow accumulation pattern is reproduced. The findings indicate that there is a significant {{redistribution of}} snow mass from the interior of the ice cap to the surrounding areas and ice slopes. Drifting snow sublimation of suspended snow is found to be stronger during spring. It is concluded that the redistribution process is strong enough to {{have a significant impact on}} glacier mass balance...|$|E
40|$|Precipitation intensities of snow {{crystals}} grown from sublimation and condensation {{processes in the}} free atmosphere at Syowa Station, Antarctica (69 ° 00 ′S, 39 ° 35 ′E) were calculated by using the data of 550 glass slides in 1968 and 300 glass slides in 1969 obtained with the replica solution method. The peak value of the maximum precipitation intensity was 1. 5 mm・hr^ in 1968 and 7. 2 mm・hr^ in 1969. Therefore, the maximum precipitation intensity ranged from (10) ^ to (10) ^ 0 mm・hr^, and the peak values of the intensity ranged from (10) ^ 0 to (10) ^ 1 mm・hr^. Next, the peak values of the maximum precipitation intensities at Syowa Station, Inuvik (68 ° 22 ′N, 133 ° 42 ′W), N. W. T., Canada in December 1979 (midwinter), and South Pole Station (90 °S) in January 1975 (austral midsummer) and in November 1978 (end of winter) were compared. The order of the maximum precipitation intensity at Syowa Station, Inuvik, and South Pole Station was regarded as (10) ^ 1,(10) ^ 0,and (10) ^ mm・hr^, respectively. Further, using the average maximum precipitation intensity and the duration of precipitation at Syowa Station, the annual amount of precipitation by snowfalls and snow storms except <b>drifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> was estimated and an approximate value of 430 mm was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Snow {{distribution}} is a dominating factor in sea-ice mass {{balance in the}} Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica, through its roles in insulating the ice and contributing to snow-ice production. The wind has long been qualitatively recognized to influence the distribution of snow accumulation on sea ice, but {{the relative importance of}} <b>drifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> has not been quantified over Antarctic sea ice prior to this study. The presence and magnitude of drifting snow were monitored continuously along with wind speeds at two sites on an ice floe in the Bellingshausen Sea during the October 2007 Sea Ice Mass Balance in the Antarctic (SIMBA) experiment. Contemporaneous precipitation measurements collected on board the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and accumulation measurements by automated ice massbalance buoys (IMBs) allow us to document the proportion of snowfall that accumulated on level ice surfaces in the presence of high winds and blowing-snow conditions. Accumulation on the sea ice during the experiment averaged 0. 03 mw. e. of precipitation on the ice floe. Accumulation changes on the ice floe were clearly associated with drifting snow and high winds. Drifting-snow transport during the SIMBA experiment was supply-limited. Using these results to inform a preliminary study using a blowing-snow model, we show that over the entire Southern Ocean approximately half of the precipitation over sea ice could be lost to leads...|$|E

40|$|<b>Drifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> is an {{extremely}} problematic and perilous aspect of roadway travel in four-season areas subject to intense snowfalls and winds during the winter season. Snow drift happens when an adequate amount of loose snow {{is available on the}} ground and the wind velocity magnitude and temperature surpass the critical values. In order to prevent the snow from reaching the road, which leads to decreased visibility and increased accidents, snow fences are designed and deployed on the road. Their orientation is based on the dominant wind direction. In this present study, the objective for exploration is to prove and test a set of new technologies that efficiently support the design and evaluation of snow fence performance by taking advantage of the new non-intrusive measurement technologies (image-based method). Several preliminary experimental set-ups were designed and implemented onsite to develop the measurement protocol to use for snowfall and snowdrift quantification. The current measurement protocols are outmoded, higher cost, and display measurement uncertainty. The majority of the current measurement required installing intrusive instruments, therefore, it poses a significant risk for the safety of personnel. Multiple non-intrusive measuring techniques are introduced and comprised in the present research with the discussion of each individual measurement’s fundamentals physics (see Chapter 3), and the application purposes for tracking both snowfall and snowdrift velocity were developed and described in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 and 6 describe the actual measurement outcomes observed from various snow events in order to test these image-based approaches compared with the physical measurement to validate the methodology used to estimate the snow velocity and map the snow deposition...|$|E
40|$|Three snow vehicles, type KD 60, were {{successfully}} {{used by the}} traverse party of the 9 th JARE (Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition) which made a round trip along 43 °E in longitude from Syowa Station to the South Pole (direct distance : 5, 180 km) during a period from September 1968 to February 1969 (141 days). This paper deals {{with one of the}} vehicles, KD 605, which has an overall cab, 7. 2 ton in weight, and is equipped with a super-charged diesel engine. It is also provided with a navigation system, several berths for the crew and cooking space, snow melter, and some racks built in for installing observation and radio equipments. In addition, to endure the severe environment of low temperature (- 60 ℃) and high altitude of 4, 000 meters, special care was taken in selecting the materials and in making the inhabitants comfortable. The vehicle covered 5, 353 km within 110 days for driving and 31 days for camping, consuming 12, 068 litres in total of diesel fuel. The snow surface was relatively hard from Syowa Station to 75 °S. On the upward slope, <b>drifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> caused by katabatic wind was intense. In some areas the snow vehicle and sleds were stuck into soft snow accumulated by wind or due to the surface configuration. The highest area along the route was a plateau more than 3, 500 meters between 75 °S and 80 °S. Soft snow covers this plateau where the wind was very weak and the air temperature was below - 50 ℃. Snow vehicle tracks sank as deep as 30 cm into the snow and the fuel consumption rate rose as high as 3. 5 l/km. Stopping longer than 5 minutes caused the runner of sled to stick to the snow surface, so that starting without help became impossible. Sticking was more pronounced with the decrease of air temperature. On the high plateau, more than 3, 700 meteis in altitude, the exhausted gas became dark due to the shortage of air and the increasing resistance. As a result, apparent output lowering was accompanied by knocking sounds while the engine was driven at low to medium speed. In the terrain south of 80 °S, (except the soft snow-covered area near the pole), the air temperature was about - 30 ℃ and the snow condition was getting better. As the terrain was downward slope, all these conditions helped the party to have pleasant driving. On the return trip, the snow surface had crust due to the effect of solar radiation and wind packing. Since the pulling-load became smaller and the air temperature became higher, the party experienced remarkable trouble to drive...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This chapter {{presents}} a multi-scale {{analysis of the}} contribution of blow-ing snow to the hydrometeorology of the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB). A cli-matology of adverse wintertime weather events demonstrates that <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> events are rare within the forested sections of the MRB but become more frequent in the northern parts of the Basin covered by tundra, which experience the largest impacts of <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation due to large-scale processes. A parameterization for <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation based on the PIEKTUK-D model and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA- 15) data is used to determine that the combined processes of surface <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation deplete 29 mm yr- 1 snow water equivalent, or about 7 % of the watershed’s annual precipitation.

40|$|<b>Blowing</b> <b>snow</b> {{transports}} <b>and</b> sublimates {{a substantial}} portion of the seasonal snowfall in the prairies of western Canada. Snow redistribution is an important feature of prairie hydrology as deep snowdrifts provide a source of meltwater to replenish ponds and generate streamflow in this dry region. The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent in the spring is therefore of great interest. A test of the distributed and aggregated modelling strategies for <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation was conducted at the St. Denis National Wildlife Area in the rolling, internally drained prairie pothole region east of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. A LiDAR-based DEM and aerial photograph-based vegetation cover map were available for this region. A coupled complex windflow <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> model was run with 262, 144 6 m ð 6 m grid cells to produce spatially distributed estimates of seasonal <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation. The calculation was then aggregated to seven landscape units that represented the major influences of surface roughness, topography <b>and</b> fetch on <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation. Both the distributed and aggregated simulations predicted similar end-of-winter snow water equivalent with substantial redistribution of <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> from exposed sparsely vegetated sites across topographic drainage divides to the densely vegetated pothole wetlands. Both simulations also agreed well with snow survey observations. While the distributed calculations provide a fascinating and detailed visual image of the interaction of complex landscapes <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> redistribution <b>and</b> sublimation, it is clear that <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation calculations can be successfully aggregated to the spatial scale of the major landscape units in this environment.

40|$|Many {{field studies}} have shown that surface {{sublimation}} <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport <b>and</b> sublimation have significant influences on the snow mass budget in many high latitude regions. We developed a coupled triple-moment blowing snow-atmospheric modeling system to study the influence of these processes on a seasonal time scale over the Northern Hemisphere. Two simulations were performed. The first is a 5 month simulation for comparison with snow survey measurements over a Saskatchewan site to validate the modeling system. The second simulation covers the 2006 / 2007 winter period to study the snow mass budget over the Northern Hemisphere. The results show that surface sublimation is significant in Eurasian Continent and the eastern region of North America, reaching a maximum value of 200 mm SWE (Snow Water Equivalent). Over the Arctic Ocean and Northern Canada, surface deposition with an average value of 30 mm SWE was simulated. <b>Blowing</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation was found to return up to 50 mm SWE back to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean, while the divergence of <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> transport contributes only a few mm SWE to the change in snow mass budget. The results were further stratified in 10 degree latitudinal bands. The results show that surface sublimation decreases with an increase in latitude while <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> sublimation increases with latitude. Taken together, the surface sublimation <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> processes was found to distribute 23 % to 52 % of winter precipitation over the three month winter season...|$|R
