5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we have done in the past... I wanted to try and take <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
500|$|Walter Yetnikoff, the {{president}} of Jackson's record company CBS Records, approached MTV about playing the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video, which MTV had not ever played in spite of Jackson's success as a musical artist. Yetnikoff became enraged when MTV refused to play the video, and he threatened {{to go public with}} MTV's stance on racial discrimination. [...] "I said to MTV, 'I'm pulling <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> off the air, all our product. I'm {{not going to give you}} any more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.'" [...] MTV relented and played the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video in heavy rotation. After the video was aired, Thriller went on to sell an additional 10 million copies. The short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame in 1992. In a 2005 poll of 31 pop stars, video directors, agents, and journalists conducted by telecommunications company 3, the music video was ranked fifth in their [...] "Top 20 Music Videos Ever". The video was also ranked as the 35th greatest music video in a list compiled by MTV and TV Guide at the millennium.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{violence}} and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen {{in light of the}} short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature [...] "religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor." [...] Discussing [...] "the connection between violence and redemption," [...] Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers [...] "of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace," [...] Tarantino [...] "seeks to demonstrate that in spite of <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen in the film— all {{the violence}}, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior— grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winchell's parents, Wally and Patricia Kutteles, {{continued}} {{to press for}} a re-examination of [...] "Don't ask, don't tell." [...] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, a point man on LGBT issues for the U.S. Army, visited with Patricia Kutteles. Despite campaigning by the Kutteleses and LGBT activist groups, the Commanding General of Fort Campbell {{at the time of}} the murder, Major General Robert T. Clark, refused to take responsibility for the purported anti-gay climate at Fort Campbell under his command. In May 2003, he met with Patricia Kutteles, who opposed his promotion saying: [...] "He doesn't have the command authority or responsibility. The promotion would be another obstacle in the way of <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> tried to do to honor our son." [...] His promotion to lieutenant general was delayed in October 2002 and May 2003. After being exonerated, he was nominated and approved for promotion to lieutenant general on December 5, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Egypt {{qualifying}} for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, {{six months to}} the day after being devastated by Port Said Stadium disaster. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team's captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. [...] "Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying," [...] he recalled. [...] "They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have.</b> We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that I have on this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E

[...] "When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of <b>everything.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> not had such a man in our theater.

5000|$|Corbet held auditions for {{the casting}} {{of the role}} of Prescott, {{describing}} it as [...] "(we) held simple auditions (one page of text) for the boys reading for the main role.

5000|$|In December 1921, Luce rejoined Hadden {{to work at}} The Baltimore News. Recalling his {{relationship}} with Hadden, Luce later said, [...] "Somehow, despite the greatest differences in temperaments and even in interests, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to work together.

60|$|Strasbourg. We {{have seen}} Strasbourg--a palpably conquered city--and the Cathedral, which beats <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever seen. Externally, it amazed me, which somehow I hadn't {{expected}} it to do. Strasbourg is gloomy, battered and painful; but apparently already much Germanized.

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the material was new, however {{a small number of}} unused songs were brought in from previous projects. Petersson revealed: [...] "It's all pretty much new.

2500|$|Lea also {{revealed}} in a 1976 fan club interview: [...] "We {{just got a}} terrific buzz when {{we were working on}} the album.

6000|$|This {{determined}} {{in the girl}} a fine impatience.

6000|$|We did {{not speak}} again until we had left Lierre, in its sacred cloud of rain, and were coming to Mechlin, under a clearer sky, that even made one think of stars.
