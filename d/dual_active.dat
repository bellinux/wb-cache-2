These devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC), have been shown to outperform their silicon counterparts when used in high frequency switching, high temperature, and high voltage applications. These properties make them highly desirable in the bidirectional <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge power converter. Being an isolated converter topology, the <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge employs a transformer to provide step-up/step-down functionality and galvanic isolation for the converter. Transformers, as well as other passive components such as inductors and capacitors may be reduced in size when higher switching frequencies are employed. SiC devices used in this application can in turn provide a means to shrink overall system size and increase the power density of the converter, proving further the viability of power electronic systems in applications that require compactness and high efficiency. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the performance benefits of SiC MOSFETs in the <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge topology. A justification for the choice of topology is included in this work, along with all of the appropriate design considerations and analysis, leading to the design of a 2 kW <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge converter.

40|$|Conventional <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge topologies provide {{galvanic}} isolation and soft-switching over a reasonable operating range without dedicated resonant circuits. However, scaling the two-level <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge to higher dc voltage levels is impeded by several challenges among which the high dv/dt {{stress on the}} coupling transformer insulation. Gating and thermal characteristics of series switch arrays add to the limitations. To avoid the use of standard bulky modular multilevel bridges, this paper analyzes an alternative modulation technique where staircase approximated trapezoidal voltage waveforms are produced; thus alleviating developed dv/dt stresses. Modular design is realized by the utilization of half-bridge chopper cells. Therefore, the analyzed converter is a modular multi-level converter operated in a new mode with no common-mode dc arm currents as well as reduced capacitor size, hence reduced cell footprint. Suitable switching patterns are developed and various design and operation aspects are studied. Soft switching characteristics will {{be shown to be}} comparable to those of the two-level <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> bridge.

A conspicuous gap in knowledge concerns the use of covalent lysine imines in transfer of carbonyl group-containing intermediates, despite their wide use in enzymatic catalysis. Here we show how imine chemistry operates in transfer of covalent intermediates in pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate biosynthesis by the Arabidopsis enzyme Pdx 1. An initial ribose 5 -phosphate lysine imine converts to the chromophoric I 320 intermediate, simultaneously bound to two lysine residues and partially vacating the active site, creating space for glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate to bind.

40|$|Active {{contours}} {{are now a}} {{very popular}} technique for shape extraction, achieved by minimising a suitably formulated energy functional. Conventional active contour formulations suffer difficulty in appropriate choice of an initial contour and values of parameters. Recent approaches have aimed to resolve these problems, but can compromise other performance aspects. To relieve the problem in initialisation, an evolutionary <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> contour has been developed, which is combined with a local shape model to improve the parameterisation. One contour expands from inside the target feature, the other contracts from the outside. The two contours are inter-linked to provide a balanced technique with an ability to reject weak’local energy minima. Additionally a <b>dual</b> <b>active</b> contour configuration using dynamic programming has been developed to locate a global energy minimum and complements recent approaches via simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. These differ from conventional evolutionary approaches, where energy minimisation may not converge to extract the target shape, {{in contrast with the}} guaranteed convergence of a global approach. The new techniques are demonstrated to extract successfully target shapes in synthetic and real images, with superior performance to previous approaches.
