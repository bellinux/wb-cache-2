40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a noticeable rise in Chinese {{outward foreign direct investment}} (FDI), which has attracted the interest of scholars from multiple business perspectives. This research focuses on two research areas of Chinese outward FOI, and its objectives are to empirically identify the determinants of the <b>establishment</b> <b>mode</b> of FDI entries and the subsidiary strategy in tern 1. '> of global integration and local responsiveness. To fulfil these objectives, J developed conceptual frameworks for I) entry choice between greenfield and acquisition, 2) subsidiary's global integration, and 3) subsidiary's responsiveness, and empirically tested these frameworks with a quantitative research method. This is done using primary data collected from companies' annual reports and relevant documents, a questionnaire survey, and multiple secondary data published by international organisations. In terms of empirical findings, this research suggests that the mainstream FDI theory, the FSA/CSA framework in particular, is capable of explaining FDJ from emerging markets and MNEs' internationalisation activities. Firstly, this research finds that Chinese MNEs do possess a certain degree of FSAs that can be internalised through a greenfield entry, while host country local resources exert significant influence on Chinese films' <b>establishment</b> <b>mode</b> decision. In addition, the importance of home country institution as a driver for firm strategic decision is confirmed in the case of Chinese outward FOI. Secondly, the extended FSA/CSA framework sheds light on the subsidiary strategy in economic integration and local responsiveness. This study finds that the subsidiary's global integration is a function of non-location-bound (NLB) FSAs of Chinese firms, while location-bound (LB) FSAs encourage a subsidiary's local responsiveness. In addition, host country CSAs in trade openness is positivel'y related to the integration, and environment complexity leads to responsive strategyEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a communication-based {{theory of the}} choice by multinational enterprises (MNEs) between greenfield and acquisition entry. It argues that MNE parents communicate with their subsidiaries for reasons of knowledge exchange, coordination, monitoring, and socialization. The expected communication costs arising from these activities are argued to increase with the verbal communication barriers existing between a prospective subsidiary and its parent, but this increase is argued to be larger for acquisitions because they require more extensive parent-subsidiary communication than greenfields. I therefore hypothesize that verbal communication barriers have positive effects on the likelihood that MNEs choose greenfield over acquisition entry. I also hypothesize that these effects are weaker for prospective subsidiaries that will have more autonomy or local co-owners. An analysis of 231 entries by Dutch MNEs into 48 countries lends substantial support to these hypotheses, indicating that geographic and linguistic barriers to verbal communication play important roles in MNEs' <b>establishment</b> <b>mode</b> decisions...|$|E

We demonstrate that a parent firm's technological intensity, international strategy and experience determine both establishment and entry mode choices. Moreover, we apply Williamson's new institutional economics to investigate the influence of institution building on multinational enterprises' dual investment choice. In the context of transition economies, we test empirically the possible moderating effect of a host country's institutional environment. We conclude that the degree of the host country's institutional advancement moderates the effect of both technological intensity and international strategy on the establishment and entry mode choice.

We therefore examine and compare the effects of five cultural distance measures on the choice by multinational enterprises (MNEs) between expanding abroad through greenfield or acquisition. Two of these measures are based on Hofstede (1980), another two on Schwartz [(1994). Beyond individualism/collectivism: New cultural dimensions of values. In U. Kim, H. C. Triandis, C.

Analyzing a sample of foreign expansions by Dutch MNEs and controlling for other factors, we find that high scores on all cultural distance measures significantly {{increase the likelihood that}} MNEs choose greenfields, and that the explanatory power of the Hofstede and Schwartz-based measures is comparable, while that of the perceptual one is somewhat lower. We conclude that it may thus be premature to dismiss Hofstede's work as outdated or as inaccurately reflecting national cultures, and to consider Schwartz's framework to be superior.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to {{a deeper understanding of the}} way that institutions impact the internationalisation of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). To address this aim I examine different aspects of SME internationalisation decisions. Based on empirical methods, I analyse two different datasets regarding an SMEs entry mode choice, its <b>establishment</b> <b>mode</b> choice, its location choice and its entry timing. The thesis comprises six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces relevant background issues including the applied definition of SMEs as well as an overview of the main theoretical and methodological issues in research on SME internationalisation. After highlighting the research interest I present the two datasets applied in the empirical analyses. Finally, the last section of chapter 1 highlights the course of investigation. In chapters 2 to 5 I empirically examine different aspects of SME internationalisation. In detail, chapter 2 investigates the moderating effects of informal institutional distance and formal institutional risk on entry mode choice among German SMEs. Informal institutional distance represents the cultural and ideological differences between a firms home country and the host country. Firms are challenged to bridge these differences when entering foreign markets. The formal institutional risk refers to the constraints resulting from insufficiently developed market support institutions in the host country. Firms have to handle additional hazards, restrictions, and costs in case of high formal institutional risk. The empirical findings add to prior research on SME internationalisation showing that the influence of established variables on entry mode selection is contingent upon the informal institutional distance and formal institutional risk in the host country. Chapter 3 elaborates on the moderating role of the perceived institutional uncertainty on foreign <b>establishment</b> <b>mode</b> choice (i. e. the decision between Greenfield and acquisition) of German SME. Arguing that the level of institutional uncertainty is contingent upon the managers perception of hazards and risks the study shows that this is of particular importance in SMEs being often family businesses with centralised decision making by single persons. Empirical results confirm that the perceived institutional uncertainty moderates the relationships between international experience, knowhow intensity, investment volume as well as market growth and the SMEs decision between Greenfield and acquisition. Chapter 4 examines the role of firm-specific knowledge intensity and international experience on SME location choice. Using the database of the Institute of Management Development, I built a new index in order to measure the institutional development of the target countries. This new index allows for a comprehensive and differentiated consideration of the individual country-specific degree of institutional development. In this context, I test an empirical model which analyzes determinants of the location decision of small and medium-sized enterprises. Results confirm that in addition to firm-specific motivations also an SMEs knowhow intensity and international experience influence location choice. Thus, the study permits a more profound understanding of the effect that moderators have on SMEs and location choices considering the institutional development of the target country. Chapter 5 elaborates on the moderating role of institutional uncertainty on entry timing of early internationalising firms. The study draws on new institutionalism to examine in detail if entry timing is contingent on the institutional context in the host country. Hypotheses suggest that the institutional uncertainty in the host country moderates the relationships between international experience, network ties, learning capabilities and early internationalisation. The studys empirical results confirm that entry timing is contingent on the institutional context permitting a more profound understanding of the moderating effect institutional uncertainty has on entry timing. Chapter 6, finally, recapitulates and summarises the theoretical and empirical contributions of this dissertation. It further provides implications for the SME management. The thesis concludes showing limitations and directions for future research. Overall, the results of the empirical studies in this thesis show that SMEs are particularly sensitive to influences from the institutional set-up in the host country...|$|E
