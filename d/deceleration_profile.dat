An instrumented anthropomorphic test dummy was used in the current study to measure the <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles</b> of the head, thorax, and pelvis upon impact onto a tile surface or floor mat.

From this study, the mean maximum values were found to significantly increase with an increase in height regardless of fall direction.

Measures included speed and <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles,</b> braking, and lateral placement observations taken from video recordings at each site. Data were collected before treatment, immediately after treatment, and 12 months after treatment. The results obtained were quite variable across sites and treatments. At curves, speed effects were mixed with both speed reductions and increases observed immediately after and 12 -months later. Braking results tended to support travel speed findings and some improvement in lateral placement were also observed at these locations. At intersections, the results were more stable where speed reductions were more common both immediately after treatment as well as longer-term. There were no differences in braking and lateral placement at these straight-road locations.

We asked 15 participants to use an ACC at designated times while driving a track. When the ACC was activated, the car decelerated either strongly or softly, which was either according to expectation or not. Heart rate, eye blinks, and brain signals (EEG) were recorded. Heart rate and blink duration were the same following the announcement of an upcoming expected or unexpected <b>deceleration</b> <b>profile.</b> Heart rate and blink duration increased when a strong compared to a soft <b>deceleration</b> <b>profile</b> was announced, consistent with a state of arousal or startle.

40|$|During braking-to-stop {{manoeuvres}} in a fixed-base driving simulator, {{the paucity}} of visual and vestibular cues can lead to driver misperception and produce different patterns of braking response between real and simulated driving. For these reasons, drivers must adapt their behaviour in a simulator to affect a comfortable and efficient braking manoeuvre. Such behavioural adaptation {{is likely to have}} negative consequences by increasing a driver’s attentional demand. In this study, 48 participants underwent a series of braking-to-stop manoeuvres in an instrumented vehicle on a test-track. Each participant was instructed to drive at 40 mph. A set of traffic lights, on occasions, changed to red as the vehicle was 58 m from the lights. <b>Deceleration</b> <b>profiles</b> provided the baseline data.

Two groups, each of 24 participants, one familiar with the simulator from previous investigations and one with no prior simulator experience, underwent the simulated traffic light scenario ten times. This paper suggests a method of objectively assessing driver braking performance between the real and simulated environments. Results appear to suggest that in as little as five or six practice stops drivers can adapt their simulator driving style to closely match that observed in a real vehicle on a test track. However, any process of adaptation from prior exposure to the simulator is short-lived...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how a single data record (rather than several time-histories) {{may be used}} to characterize an impending two-car, rear-end collision in which a lead-vehicle and following-vehicle are initially separated by a range of Ro. The characterization process assumes an idealized deceleration profile: a vehicle initially traveling at velocity Vo decelerates instantaneously from zero to a constant level, do, at some brake application time, tb. Therefore, a set of seven single-valued covariates (VFo, dFo, tFb, VLo, dLo, tLb, and Ro) {{may be used to}} describe the actions of both vehicles. In driving simulator tests, the unit may be programmed to meet the ideal deceleration assumption. In naturalistic driving, however, the assumption rarely holds true. Nonetheless, many naturalistic braking events may be accurately represented by a carefully chosen set of covariates. The data reduction procedure described herein shows how the covariates are determined from just two measurements: following-vehicle velocity and inter-vehicle range. The validity of the process is demonstrated using data from the Iowa Driving Simulator, where the actual <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles</b> of both vehicles are shown for comparison. The process is then applied to naturalistic driving data from a field operational test of an Intelligent (Adaptive) Cruise Control system.

40|$|Drivers adopt nearly {{constant}} deceleration rates when {{intending to}} stop at a distant target. In driving simulators however we often observe different control strategies. Depending on simulator fidelity, <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles</b> range from saw-tooths to multi-modal profiles to profiles that do resemble those seen in reality. These deviations from reality suggest that drivers have difficulty controlling their vehicle {{based on the assumption}} that a constant deceleration rate (approximately constant brake pedal depression) is most efficient at least from a control and attention point of view. The discrepancy between reality and simulation is attributed to the fact that perception of distance, speed, and acceleration, as well as time-to-collision are biased in all current driving simulators (i. e. they are perceived at scaled magnitudes). We introduce a driver model for stopping behavior and demonstrate its capability to reproduce the braking profiles observed in various driving simulators by varying only two model parameters: i) control gain, and ii) the perceived time-to-collision at which braking is initiated. For a given set of simulator dependent perceptual biases in distance, speed, and acceleration estimation, it appears that drivers only need to adapt these two parameters to achieve efficient deceleration, which in some cases takes surprisingly much practice. The reason is attributed to the fact that such a simple adaptation is perceived as counter intuitive when the perceptual biases do not satisfy a particular ratio. If for example, acceleration perception is accurate but speed an...|$|R

Previous research has measured {{the effectiveness of these}} devices as driver compliance rates and driver understanding of the devices, but the effects of these devices on driver behavior have not yet been examined comprehensively. Therefore, the influence of remotely operated stop–slow traffic control devices on driver behavior was examined. Video-recorded traffic movements from a rural work zone in the Queensland state of Australia provided driver speeds, <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles,</b> stopping behavior, and compliance rates for a set of remotely operated devices new to Australia: static red–amber–green lights, static red–amber lights, static red–amber arrow lights, and mechanical stop–slow signs. Pneumatic tube traffic counters were used to collect driver speeds before and after the devices, and an on-road driver survey was conducted to elicit driver understanding of the devices. Results indicated that drivers had difficulty understanding the new devices, particularly the amber light and amber arrow options (which confused drivers about their meaning—to stop or to go). The new remotely operated devices resulted in higher approach speeds, greater variability in approach speeds, and faster deceleration rates than the flagger method. The good compliance rates observed with the remotely operated devices imply that the devices could improve flagger safety by reducing flagger exposure to traffic; however, the negative effects on driver behavior might indicate an increased risk of rear-end crashes in the advance warning area...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{exploration}} of planetary bodies by surface probes has entered a new phase of interest. The mechanical properties of the near-surface layers of cometary and planetary bodies, including their strength, texture and layering, are important parameters needed both for a proper physical understanding of these bodies and {{for the design of}} lander missions. The strength properties of such a surface can be determined either by measuring the penetration resistance encountered by a slowly penetrating tip (quasi-static penetrometry), or by impacting the surface with an artificial body whose mechanical properties and impact velocity are known. At low speeds (up to about 300 m s− 1), it is often feasible to measure the force or deceleration during penetration (‘impact’ or ‘dynamic’ penetrometry). If the event is better described in terms of hypervelocity impact cratering than penetration, analysis of the resulting crater is performed instead. Other uses of artificial impacts include the generation of seismic waves to aid the calibration of seismometers and the formation of a crater and / or ejecta for analysis or sampling of the target body. Such methods feature in many recent, current and forthcoming planetary missions. Examples include: the Surface Science Package of the Huygens probe, the anchoring harpoon of the Rosetta Lander, various Mars penetrators and landers, NASA's Deep Impact mission and ESA's planned Mercury cornerstone mission BepiColombo. A short overview of missions (past, present, future) featuring penetrometry experiments or artificial impacts is given.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} {{guidance}} algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the longitudinal guidance law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop longitudinal guidance commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit <b>deceleration</b> <b>profile.</b> Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions.

The study was initiated with data collection in the summer of 2013 in Stockholm. A number of commuter cyclists were recruited and then provided with GPS devices to record their daily cycling trips. The GPS devices were portable but qualified enough to measure cyclists’ position, speed and altitude with a time interval of one second. Before the winter, around 100 natural cycling trips made in the urban area of Stockholm were collected and a database was later established to manage the raw data. Prior to the data analysis, measurement noise cancellation and profile smoothing were performed by implementing multiple processing approaches, including the robust locally weight regression and the Kalman filtering. A cycling regime which separates the cyclist behavior into three different kinds (acceleration, deceleration and cruising) was constructed based on the data observation. According to this regime, a normal cyclist should always endeavor to achieve and maintain a desired speed which varies depending on a number of factors, such as the cyclist’s own demographics and the road grade. If a cyclist’s present speed was not corresponding to her present desired speed, she would accelerate or decelerate immediately. Based on this assumption, the GPS data were classified into three parts, including dedicated datasets for acceleration <b>profiles,</b> <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles</b> and cruising profiles. The profiles were analyzed statistically and some significant cycling characteristics were founded. Moreover, mathematical models were formulated to describe cyclists’ acceleration and deceleration behavior. The models were further estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator and evaluated by several goodness-of-fit measures...|$|R
40|$|Meteors with peak {{magnitudes}} fainter than + 2 {{are typically}} called faint meteors, {{resulting from the}} atmospheric entry and ablation of meteoroids less massive than 10 - 4 kg. The processes of luminous wake formation and fragmentation, which occur during ablation, are poorly understood for faint meteors, and are important constraints for models of meteoroid structure. The goal of this work is to improve understanding of these processes through analysis of high-resolution intensified video observations, and creation of a detailed meteoroid ablation model. In {{the first part of}} this work, thirty faint meteors observed with the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) are analysed, revealing meteor trails with widths up to 100 m at heights above 110 km. These widths vary with height as the inverse of the atmospheric density, suggesting that formation of the wake is related to collisions between evaporated meteoric atoms and atmospheric molecules. Next, nine fragmenting faint meteors captured with CAMO are examined. Fragments from eight of the nine meteors are found to have transverse speeds up to 100 m s- 1. These speeds are not explained by aerodynamic separation theory typically used for brighter meteors that fragment at lower heights. Instead, fragment separation by rotational breakup of the meteoroid or electrostatic repulsion are considered, giving meteoroid strength estimates up to 1 MPa. These strengths are typical of meteorite-producing meteoroids and are larger than expected for small meteoroids. Finally, a single-body ablation model, based on modelling collisions between the meteoroid, meteoric atoms, and atmospheric molecules, is devised to explain wake formation. Synthetic meteor trail widths and lengths, as well as light curves and <b>deceleration</b> <b>profiles,</b> are compared to observations of nine meteors from {{the first part of this}} thesis. The widths of simulated meteor wakes show good agreement with observations, but simulated wake lengths are too short. This suggests that collisional de-excitation of meteoric particles is a plausible process for wake formation, but also that meteoroid fragmentation likely increases the length of the meteor wake. Compared to observations, simulated light curves are longer, and simulated meteoroids experience less deceleration, suggesting that meteoroid fragmentation should be investigated in the next iteration of the model...|$|R

Application of this RP is also suggested when a railroad is considering changes to its operation (such as maximum authorized speed, <b>deceleration</b> rate, stopping <b>profile,</b> or station spacing) ...|$|R
