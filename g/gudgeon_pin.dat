5000|$|Bearings - the {{load-bearing}} assembly {{on which}} the headstock (and so the whole bell) turns about its <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins.</b> Modern hanging means the bell is hung on ball bearings, but were traditionally plain bearings.|$|R
50|$|Lubrication {{is fully}} forced {{including}} to the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins.</b> Cold starting conditions are provided for by splash lubrication to all vital parts. There are separate inlet and exhaust manifolds on the offside (left) with a hotspot. Cooling water circulates naturally to the radiator. A mechanical fuel pump delivers petrol from a tank {{at the back}} of the car.|$|R
50|$|The valvegear {{actuating}} the valve was very simple. Each piston had two parallel connecting rods, working on separated crankpin journals between the same crank webs. An eccentric {{between the two}} crankpins drove the centrally-mounted valve spindle by another short connecting rod. Because {{of the need to}} allow the valve rod to pass through between them, the piston had two overhung stub <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins,</b> rather than a single through pin.|$|R
50|$|Other compact {{alternatives}} to the return connecting rod or trunk engines were Maudslay's siamese engine and the rare annular piston engine. Like the trunk engine, these placed the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> within {{the length of the}} piston stroke by having a pair of pistons and a T-shaped crosshead that could relocate the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> behind its usual position.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> is {{typically}} a forged short hollow rod {{made of a}} steel alloy of high strength and hardness that may be physically separated from both the connecting rod and piston or crosshead. The design of the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin,</b> {{especially in the case}} of small, high-revving automotive engines is challenging. The <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> has to operate under some of the highest temperatures experienced in the engine, with difficulties in lubrication due to its location, while remaining small and light so as to fit into the piston diameter and not unduly add to the reciprocating mass. The requirements for lightness and compactness demand a small diameter rod that is subject to heavy shear and bending loads, with some of the highest pressure loadings of any bearing in the whole engine. To overcome these problems, the materials used to make the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> and the way it is manufactured are amongst the most highly engineered of any mechanical component found in internal combustion engines.|$|E
50|$|In engines, a <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> (UK, {{wrist pin}} US) joins the small {{end of a}} {{connecting}} rod to a piston or crosshead.|$|E
50|$|Flange-mounted steel barrels were {{bolted to}} the {{crankcase}} and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder head with integral cooling fins. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins.</b> The nine pistons drove the single throw crankshaft via one channel-section master rod and eight circular section auxiliary rods. The master rod had an integral, split type big-end. The crankshaft was machined from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights.|$|R
50|$|Timken roller {{bearings}} were used throughout, including on the three-axle tender bogies, the coupling and connecting rods {{as well as}} the crosshead <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins,</b> while the locomotive's leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. Compared to earlier SAR practice, a novelty was the adoption of mechanical lubrication. A sixteen-feed lubricator was driven off the reversing link trunnion. Since the Class 25 was entirely mounted on {{roller bearings}}, very little effort was required to move these huge locomotives.|$|R

5000|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> (UK, wrist pin US) connects the piston to the connecting rod {{and provides a}} bearing for the connecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves. [...] In very early engine designs (including those driven by steam and also many very large stationary or marine engines), the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> {{is located in a}} sliding crosshead that connects to the piston via a rod. A gudgeon is a pivot or journal. The origin of the word gudgeon is the Middle English word gojoun, which originated from the Middle French word goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|When used {{to retain}} piston wrist pins /gudgeon pins the clips {{are known as}} wrist pin clips or wrist pin {{retainers}} or <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> clips [...] The most commonly used circlip for this application is a simple spring steel circlip , or plain wire ring.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Early" [...] HA engine uses 31.75mm <b>gudgeon</b> (wrist) <b>pins,</b> has {{indirect}} fuel injection, {{and uses}} pressed sheet metal ("tin") rocker (valve) covers.|$|R
50|$|Steel {{cylinder}} liners were screwed into the heads, with their lower parts projecting into the crankcase. Steel seats for valves and sparking plugs were shrunk into the heads. The pistons were forged from alugir, with three compression and one scraper ring and floating bronze bushes for the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins.</b> The twelve pistons {{were connected to}} the six crankpins in pairs, each with a master and an auxiliary connecting rod. The master rods had forked big ends with white metal bearings; the auxiliary rod ends ran between the forks on bronze bushes.|$|R
50|$|The Class 25NC was {{superheated}} {{and used}} piston valves actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Timken roller bearings were used throughout, including on the three-axle tender bogies, the coupling and connecting rods {{as well as}} the crosshead <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins,</b> while the locomotive's leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. Compared to earlier SAR practice, a novelty was the adoption of mechanical lubrication. A sixteen-feed lubricator was driven off the reversing link trunnion. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. The steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. Being entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The A12A is a 1.2-liter (1,237 cc) engine. It used {{a casting}} {{similar to the}} A12 and same stroke, but used a 75 mm bore (up from 73 mm), for an {{increase}} of 66 cc capacity. It too was of an overhead valve design. Also used a different(stronger) conrod with a larger diameter <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A trunk engine {{locates the}} {{connecting}} rod within a large-diameter hollow piston rod. This [...] "trunk" [...] carries almost no load. The {{interior of the}} trunk is open to outside air, and is wide enough to accommodate the side-to-side motion of the connecting rod, which links a <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> at the piston head to an outside crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The intake ports are narrow {{enough to}} ensure that piston rings {{do not need to}} be pegged. Instead of using a <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin,</b> each piston is {{connected}} to its connecting rod via a ball and socket joint, to enable the piston to rotate. This feature has been abandoned for the Gen-2 version in favour of conventional gudgeon pins.|$|E
50|$|Empire Stores of Bradford was Britain's first {{mail order}} firm in 1890, bought by Redcats UK (French) and closed in 2009; {{it is now the}} site of Redcats UK in the north of the town centre. BASF Performance Products (Ciba Specialty Chemicals until 2008, then Allied Colloids before 1997) is in Low Moor; it makes many {{chemicals}} including thickening agents. Bowers Metrology Group, on the B6381 near the junction with A6177 at Bradford Moor, are a leading measuring instruments company, and part of Spear & Jackson. Equifax is off the A650 in central Bradford, opposite the Leisure Exchange; next door RBS Group have a call centre. Federal-Mogul, off the A650 in east Bradford, makes automotive parts (<b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins</b> and pistons). Princes Soft Drinks have their main factory south of the A650 at Tong Street; Next have a large warehouse nearby.|$|R
50|$|The Type CZ {{condensing}} tenders {{were slightly}} longer than their engines. One-third {{of the total}} length of the tender was {{taken up by the}} water tank and coal bunker, while the rest was taken up by eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five steam-driven roof-mounted fans. Roller bearings were used throughout on all these locomotives, including the coupling and connecting rods, the crosshead <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins</b> as well as the three-axle bogies of both the standard and condensing tenders. The leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece, while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frames of both locomotive types were also one-piece steel water-bottom castings. Since they were entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these big locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automobile Industry is {{the largest}} {{industry}} in the world. Automotive engines need to be reconditioned after certain running. The frictional torque of a half engine (which consists of cylinder block, pistons with rings and <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins,</b> connecting rods, crankshaft and bearings) is about 75 % to 80 % of the total frictional torque of that engine. The components of new engines are manufactured with high degree of automation and accuracy but the same is not available during their reconditioning. Obviously, due to difference in accuracy of CNC machines and GPMs, a newly manufactured half engine has comparatively less frictional torque than a reconditioned one. This results in somewhat poor performance of a reconditioned engine {{as compared with the}} new one. The objective of this research work is to design & develop a test rig which could measure the frictional torque of a reconditioned half engine accurately and to bring quality consciousness in engine reconditioning business...|$|R
50|$|A {{piston rod}} is {{attached}} to the piston and links it to the crosshead, which is a large casting sliding in crosshead guides (UK: slidebar), allowing it only to move {{in the same direction as}} the piston travel. The crosshead also houses the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> on which the small end of the connecting rod pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the crosshead and its bearings, not to the piston itself.|$|E
50|$|Their pistons {{are usually}} trunk pistons, where the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin</b> joint of the {{connecting}} rod {{is within the}} piston itself. This avoids the crosshead, piston rod and its sealing gland, but it also makes a single-acting piston almost essential. This, in turn, {{has the advantage of}} allowing easy access {{to the bottom of the}} piston for lubricating oil, which also has an important cooling function. This avoids local overheating of the piston and rings.|$|E
50|$|Large slow-speed Diesel engines {{may require}} {{additional}} {{support for the}} side forces on the piston. These engines typically use crosshead pistons. The main piston has a large piston rod extending downwards from the piston to what is effectively a second smaller-diameter piston. The main piston is responsible for gas sealing and carries the piston rings. The smaller piston is purely a mechanical guide. It runs within a small cylinder as a trunk guide and also carries the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1907 {{the company}} made its own narrow-angle V4 engine with {{desmodromic}} valves. The engine had a single cast iron T-head monobloc on a light alloy crankcase. This contained four cylinders in a square layout with a narrow 15° vee angle. Bore and stroke were 60 by 100mm, giving a capacity of 1.13 litres. It was rated at 8/10 fiscal horsepower. The crankshaft was short with disk webs, two main bearings and fork-and-blade connecting rods. Crankpins and main journals were held in the webs by tapers and a shallow nut, giving the effect of an undercut crankshaft. This made the engine extremely compact overall, [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall. The intention was to offer this compact engine as a replacement that would fit into {{a wide range of}} other vehicles. The crankshaft was drilled for a pressure oil feed to the crankpins, an advanced feature for this time, but the pistons and <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins</b> were still lubricated by splash.|$|R
2500|$|The G60 is a 1.8-litre {{internal}} combustion engine, which displaces [...] from a cylinder bore of , and a piston stroke of [...] [...] Its cylinder block is constructed from grey cast iron, and its cylinder head is cast aluminium alloy, with additional post-production heat treatment. [...] The crankcase contains a forged steel crankshaft which runs in five main bearings, and cast pistons with increased size <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins.</b> [...] It has two valves per cylinder (eight valves in total), which are {{operated by a}} toothed belt-driven forged steel single overhead camshaft (SOHC) via hydraulic valve lifters, with the valves being closed by two concentric valve springs. [...] Charged air is cooled via an intercooler, and the operation {{and control of the}} engine is managed by a Bosch Digifant engine control unit, which includes common rail electronic multi-point fuel injection and a knock sensor. [...] It produced a maximum rated motive power output of [...] at 5,800revolutions per minute (rpm), and could generate a turning force torque of [...] at 4,000rpm.|$|R
50|$|The {{new engine}} has a Lanchester {{vibration}} damper {{on the front}} end of its crankshaft. Its camshaft and valves are overhead, the valves being set at an angle of 45 degrees {{on either side of the}} spark plug. At the back of the engine there is a vertical shaft to drive the camshaft. The camshaft works the inlet valves through rockers and by horizontal pushrods works the exhaust valves on the opposite side. The whole mechanism is enclosed and the covers are easy to remove. The double springs on the valve stems have variable tension. Though removing the cylinder head is not as simple as on a conventional design its removal does not affect the timing of the engine or its magneto. The crankshaft has three bearings, the camshaft four. The air supply to the carburettor is routed through a tunnel in the crankcase and in this way the air is slightly warmed while cooling the crankshaft's central bearing. The pistons are manganese with tubular connecting rods and the <b>gudgeon</b> <b>pins</b> receive positive oiling.|$|R
