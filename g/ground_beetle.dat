25|$|A few {{species are}} {{nuisance}} pests. Zabrus {{is one of}} the few herbivorous <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> genera, and on rare occasions Zabrus tenebrioides, for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to grain crops. Large species, usually Carabinae, can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as camping; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for Carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their repugnatorial secretions, so it generally is not a good idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving at the University of Cambridge in January 1828, Darwin found [...] this elite {{theological}} {{training institution}} governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at Christ's College, {{so he took}} lodgings above a tobacconists in Sidney Street, across the road. [...] Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of beetles. Trainee clergymen scoured Cambridgeshire for specimens, referring to An Introduction to Entomology by William Kirby and William Spence. Charles joined his older cousin William Darwin Fox who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable. [...] They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about natural history from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix <b>Ground</b> <b>Beetle,</b> [...] Panagaeus cruxmajor. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three. The specimens he did not lose had to be mounted and identified, and his knowledge from Edinburgh of Lamarck proved useful. Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soirées, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the Revd. Adam Sedgwick and the new mineralogist the Revd. William Whewell.|$|E
2500|$|Insects {{include the}} {{intertidal}} <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> Dicheirotrichus gustavi which emerges from cracks or holes {{to feed on}} the salt marshes after dusk. Despite living in a coastal environment, it has no cycle of behaviour linked to the tides, simply scurrying for dry land when caught by the approaching sea.

40|$|Semi-natural {{habitats}} are {{key components}} of rural landscapes because they shelter {{a significant number of}} overwintering arthropods that are beneficial to agriculture. However, woodlots are semi-natural habitats with high patch-level heterogeneity and this aspect has been poorly studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the influence of woodlot heterogeneity on overwintering <b>ground</b> <b>beetles.</b> Woodlot heterogeneity was characterized in terms of distance from the woodlot boundary and date of the most recent logging operation. We used emergence traps to quantify the population density of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that overwintered in the different parts of the woodlot. In woodlot edges the densities and species richness of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were significantly higher than in the rest of the woodlot. <b>Ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that are active in crop fields overwintered in the edges but not in the inner zone of the woodlot. Species assemblages of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> overwintering in the edges were highly diverse. The date of the most recent logging operation did not explain the distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that overwintered in the woodlot. Our results show that woodlots, and in particular their edges, are used as a winter shelter by <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that spend part of their life in crops, which potentially favours biological control in adjacent crop fields...|$|R

2500|$|In Britain, {{there has}} been a large {{reduction}} in the area covered by heath lands over the past 150 years.

[...] There has been concern in the past that roadways disrupt the habitats of B. cephalotes and that the roads lead to the insects surviving but not breeding. [...] However, recent studies show that the [...] sandy roadsides can link habitats and create refuges for the beetles.

2500|$|There {{are several}} other karst {{invertebrates}} {{that are also}} endangered in Travis County and neighboring Williamson County. They include Texella reddelli (Bee Creek cave harvestman), Texella reyesi (Bone Cave harvestman), Tartarocreagris texana (Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion), Neoleptoneta myopica (Tooth Cave spider), Rhadine persephone (Tooth Cave <b>ground</b> <b>beetle),</b> Batrisodes texanus (Coffin Cave mold beetle). All of these karst invertebrates are considered troglobites, which are characterized by living their entire lives underground, have small or absent eyes, elongated appendages, and other adaptations to their subterranean environment. A widely accepted theory {{for the evolution of}} [...] troglobites is that during a series of climatic changes in the Pleistocene epoch, certain creatures wandered into the caves for a more stable environment and over time evolved into the invertebrates they are today. Troglobites prefer to inhabit the dark zone of the cave where the humidity and temperature are relatively constant. High temperatures nearly 100% humidity is required for most troglobites. There are some 7,700 species of troglobites, but this is probably {{only a small portion of}} the population because most of them have not been discovered. Even though they spend their entire life under ground in total darkness they depend very much on the world above. Rootlets from the trees above crawl down into the caves providing bug food. The bugs that feed on these rootlets are the troglobites prey. Moisture and heat from above and the natural springs within the caves provide the humidity that is needed to support their life. Because all of these invertebrates share similar habitats, they face many of the same threats as the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle that has led to their endangerment.|$|E
2500|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{are only}} an occasionally {{contributor to the}} diet in many regions. Most of the 30 or so species recorded have been taken as supplemental prey in Spain, i.e. several lizards (including geckos), frogs and toads, snakes and, to a lesser degree, turtles. One species widely and commonly reported in Europe outside of the Iberian region is the [...] common frog (Rana temporaria). It was the leading prey, making up 45% of the prey found at nests in Rogaland, Norway. Also, the common frog was the second most abundant prey species in studies from southern Sweden, Valais and Engadin in Switzerland, Verbano-Cusi-Ossola, Italy and an enormous study from Slovakia, in the latter 10,476 frogs recorded making up 28.2% of the prey. There are no records of vicious fights between snakes and Eurasian eagle-owls as there are with the great horned owl, with the horned owl sometimes losing its life after attacking a snake. Perhaps with their larger size and greater power, the eagle-owl can more easily overpower any snakes they encounter, although most snakes in Europe and temperate Asia are not particularly large. Like the golden eagle, the eagle-owl may attack spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). In Lebanon, a “large adult” tortoise, which {{would be at least}} as heavy as the eagle-owl itself, was among their food items, although how they handle and eat this large, hard-shelled prey is not clear. Eurasian eagle-owls also opportunistically prey on fish, although never in large numbers, as fish are likely to be taken incidentally while hunting for other prey such as water birds. This species is known to take a greater diversity of fish (more than 30 species verified) and is more widely reported to hunt them than the great horned owl. Most of the fish recorded are medium-sized, with at least 10 each of various kinds of carp or cod, but several species averaging more than [...] in mature mass have been taken, including common barbell (Barbus barbus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), northern pike (Esox lucius) and a few species of trout, even bigger marine predators like the anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and European conger (Conger conger). However, in many cases small, young specimens may be caught of these large fish species rather than full-grown adults. Several species of insect and invertebrate have been identified in eagle-owl pellets. In some cases, these may be undigested insects in the stomachs of birds eaten by the eagle-owl but Eurasian eagle-owls have been verified as actively hunting insects and aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crabs before. Especially diverse in the diet are ground-based beetles, at least 20 species have been identified mainly those in the Carabus (<b>ground</b> <b>beetle)</b> genus.|$|E
60|$|It {{is perhaps}} in insects {{that we may}} best study the varied means by which animals are defended or concealed. One of the uses of the {{phosphorescence}} with which many insects are furnished, is probably to frighten away their enemies; for Kirby and Spence state that a <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> (Carabus) has been observed running round and round a luminous centipede as if afraid to attack it. An immense number of insects have stings, and some stingless ants of the genus Polyrachis are armed with strong and sharp spines on the back, which must render them unpalatable {{to many of the}} smaller insectivorous birds. Many beetles of the family Curculionidæ have the wing cases and other external parts so excessively hard, that they cannot be pinned without first drilling a hole to receive the pin, and it is probable that all such find a protection in this excessive hardness. Great numbers of insects hide themselves among the petals of flowers, or in the cracks of bark and timber; and finally, extensive groups and even whole orders have a more or less powerful and disgusting smell and taste, which they either possess permanently, or can emit at pleasure. The attitudes of some insects may also protect them, as the habit of turning up the tail by the harmless rove-beetles (Staphylindidæ) no doubt leads other animals besides children to the belief that they can sting. The curious attitude assumed by sphinx caterpillars is probably a safeguard, as well as the blood-red tentacles which can suddenly be thrown out from the neck, by the caterpillars of all the true swallow-tailed butterflies.|$|E
