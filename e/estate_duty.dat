25|$|In 1950, the {{unexpected}} {{death of the}} 10th Duke of Devonshire and the subsequent death duties (rated at 80%) caused the sale {{of many of the}} Devonshire assets and estates, including Hardwick. The decision was made to hand the house over to HM Treasury in lieu of <b>Estate</b> <b>Duty</b> in 1956. The Duchess agreed to the plan despite her love for the estate. In 1959, the Treasury transferred the house to the National Trust. The Duchess remained in occupation until her death on 2 April 1960. Having done much to conserve the textiles in the house, she was to be its last occupant.|$|E
25|$|Harry Campion (later Sir Harry Campion) {{was born}} in Worsley, Lancashire, and was educated at Farnworth Grammar School and Manchester University. After leaving university, Campion joined the newly formed Cotton Trade Statistical Bureau, which {{collected}} data on output and sales of the cotton industry in the UK and also data on cotton industries of other countries and principal export markets and where he {{took part in the}} preparation of a regular digest of statistics. He spent 1932 in the United States, having been awarded a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship, then returned to Manchester University where he became Robert Ottley Reader in Statistics from 1933 to 1939 and set up an Economic Research Section carrying out applied research. While at Manchester he published research on the distribution of national capital using <b>estate</b> <b>duty</b> data and a book on public and private property. In 1939, Mr Campion joined the Central Economic Intelligence Service (CEIS), part of the War Cabinet Office, whose purpose was to provide economic and statistical material for a continuous survey of financial and economic plans and where Campion's role was to organise the statistics needed.|$|E

Fisher visited New Zealand during this time which saw Billy Hughes serve as acting Prime Minister for two months.

[...] Wartime legislation in 1914 and 1915 included the War Precautions acts (giving the Governor-General {{power to make regulations}} for national security), a Trading with the Enemy Act, War Census acts, a Crimes Act, a Belgium Grant Act, and an Enemy Contracts Annulment Act. In December 1914, a War Pensions Act was passed to provide for the grant of Pensions upon the death or incapacity of Members of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth and Members of the Imperial Reserve Forces residents in Australia whose death or incapacity resulted from their employment in connection with warlike operations.|$|E

2500|$|In 1853, {{a new tax}} was introduced, [...] "Succession duty." [...] This {{not only}} {{resulted}} in tax being payable on all forms of inheritance, but also removed several loopholes to avoid paying inheritance taxes. In 1881 [...] "Probate Duty" [...] became payable on all personal property bequeathed at death. The wording personal property meant {{that for the first}} time not only the house and its estate were taxed but also the contents of the house including jewellery – these were often of greater value than the estate itself. By 1884 <b>Estate</b> <b>Duty</b> taxed property of any manner bequeathed at death, but even when the Liberal government in 1894 reformed and tidied the complicated system at 8% on properties valued at over one million pounds, they were not punitive to a social class able to live comfortably off inherited wealth far below that sum. Death duties, however, slowly increased and became a serious problem for the country estate throughout the first half of the 20th century, reaching a zenith when assisting in the funding of World War II. This proved to be the deciding factor for many families when in 1940 death duties were raised from 50% to 65%, and following the cessation of hostilities they were twice raised further between 1946 and 1949. Attempts by some families to avoid paying death duties were both helped and hindered by war. Some estate owners gave their properties to their heirs thereby escaping duties; when subsequently that heir was killed fighting, death duties were not payable because a soldier's or sailor's (and later airman's) estate was not subject to the tax. However, if the heir had died single and intestate, the former owner would become the owner again, and when that owner died, the death taxes would have to be paid. (If however the serviceman had left an heir, death duties were avoided for at least one generation.) ...|$|E

50|$|When the Reverend Robert Holden died in 1926 his son Robert Millington Holden succeeded to the estate. Owing to falling {{agricultural}} rents and outstanding <b>estate</b> <b>duties</b> owed to {{the state}} {{he was forced to}} consider selling the property. Initially atauction on the 2 November 1927 the Temple and parkland of 650 acres was left unsold. By the inter-war period, high taxation, agricultural decline and decreasing social and political control meant that landowners now focused increasingly upon financial survival over social splendours. Nuthall and its remaining land were subsequently sold privately. Fittings sold at auction in 529 lots on 23 and 24 May 1929.|$|R

40|$|In the mid 1960 s {{there were}} about 22, 000 single-family {{leasehold}} homes in Honolulu. Dissatisfaction with leasehold led to reform legislation in 1967, allowing lessees to buy leased land. By 1991 less than 5000 lessees remained. This paper examines why landowners elected to lease rather than sell land and attributes the rise of leasehold to legal constraints on land sales by large <b>estates,</b> <b>duties</b> of <b>estate</b> trustees and the federal tax code. Idelogical forces initiated land reform in 1967, but rent-seeking forces captured the process in the mid 1970 s. It is concluded that Hawaii's experiment with leasehold was a failure due to the difficulties associated with specifying and enforcing long-term contracts in residential land. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys what {{is known}} about wealth {{distribution}} in Australia and concludes that our knowledge is scanty. The most reliable evidence comes from studies using probate returns and with the abolition of <b>estate</b> <b>duties,</b> these studies are becoming out of date. However, it is clear that wealth is very unequally distributed. The top 5 per cent of adult individuals own between 40 and 50 per cent of the wealth. This inequality is not just due to life cycle effects, and there is no strong evidence that wealth distribution has become more equal in Australia in the period since the First World War.

60|$|On many grounds we may commend this Budget to the House. It makes {{provision}} for the present. It makes greater {{provision for}} the future. Indirect taxation reaches the minimum. Food taxation reaches the minimum since the South African war. Certainly the working classes {{have no reason}} to complain. Nothing in the Budget touches the physical efficiency and energy of labour. Nothing in it touches the economy of the cottage home. Middle-class people with between £300 and £2,000 a year are not affected in any considerable degree, except by the <b>estate</b> <b>duties,</b> and in that not to a large extent, while in some cases they are distinctly benefited in the general way of taxation.
