40|$|The {{greenhouse}} {{industry is}} facing significant challenges {{such as the}} demand for more efficient use of energy and natural resources and prevention of detrimental environmental impacts. Reducing negative environmental impacts {{can be achieved by}} utilizing recycled and environmentally friendly products and by optimizing the use of water and root zone substrates. New and advanced root zone substrates are currently tested as substitute for natural soils in greenhouse agriculture. They can be inert non-organic materials such as rockwool and perlite. These are mined products from the earth, and are difficult to dispose after use. Natural substrates such as peat are being consumed faster than being regenerated. A new potential substrate that consists of recycled <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates is considered an alternative, as it is environmentally friendly, non-toxic and disposable. Experiments with <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates and with <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregate/coconut coir mixtures indicated that the yield of greenhouse tomatoes was not statistically significant different (α= 0. 05) when compared to rockwool. To investigate the potential application of recycled glass as a root zone substrate, physical and hydraulic properties were measured. For comparison, the same measurements were completed for rockwool, coconut coir, perlite, and PET/PE fibers as well as for a mixture of coconut coir and recycled glass. The water characteristics (WC) determined for each substrate exhibited distinct air entry potentials, which provided information for irrigation scheduling, water storage and aeration for optimum plant growth conditions. Coconut coir and rockwool exhibited a unimodal shaped water retention curve, while <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates and perlite exhibited bimodal shaped curves.

30|$|It {{also could}} be seen that <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks in both {{the first and second}} group {{experienced}} no significant change in weight as well as appearance.

The minimal corrosion rates were 0.0580 and 0.0583  mm/y, denoting that <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks were very stable and were not selective to the outer environments. The excellent corrosion resistance could be explained by the protective silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) layer formed above the surface during the experimental process (Soo Park et al. 1999).

The carbon fibers addition used for this study is 1, 2, 3. 5 and 5 wt% in relation to the <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> load.

Since 1972 blocks of Expanded Polystyrene have been used extensively in road projects for a variety of applications also including blocks produced from re-circulated EPS material.

We now see both a wider use of this material on a global scale and the introduction of a number of different design applications. In addition to reduced vertical loads, advantages from using EPS may also include reduced horizontal loads, simplified designs, foundations placed directly on EPS blocks and increased speed and ease of performing construction activities.
