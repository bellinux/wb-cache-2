5|$|The banded sugar ant is {{considered}} a household pest and is occasionally seen in houses at night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; carbon <b>disulphide</b> is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray formic acid, however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the formic acid they spray is corrosive to human skin. The eggs of this species were consumed by the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

The bitumen {{is found in}} the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon <b>disulphide),</b> with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120°C.

25|$|The {{production}} of free immunoglobulin light chains in normal individuals is approximately 500mg/day from bone marrow and lymph node cells. There is approximately 40% excess immunoglobulin light-chain production over immunoglobulin heavy-chain synthesis. Possibly {{this is simply}} to allow proper conformation of the intact immunoglobulin molecules, but an immunological role for the free light chains has also been proposed. There are approximately twice as many kappa-producing plasma cells as lambda plasma cells. Kappa free-light chains are normally monomeric, while lambda free-light chains tend to be dimeric, joined by <b>disulphide</b> bonds. Polymeric forms of both types of free light chain can also occur.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that the aging process is associated with a pro-oxidizing shift in the cellular redox state. The amounts of the redox-sensitive free aminothiols (glutathione, cysteine, Cys-Gly and methionine) and protein mixed <b>disulphides</b> were measured at different ages and ambient temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster. GSH/GSSG ratios decreased significantly with increasing age of the flies, due to an increase in GSSG content. Concentrations of Cys-Gly increased and methionine decreased with age. The amounts of protein mixed <b>disulphides,</b> measured as protein-cysteinyl, protein-Cys-Gly and protein-glutathionyl mixed <b>disulphides,</b> increased as a function of age. The pattern of changes in free aminothiol content, glutathione-redox state and protein mixed <b>disulphides</b> varied in proportion to the ambient temperature, which is inversely related to the life expectancy of the flies. Collectively, these results support the idea that the pro-oxidizing shift in the glutathione-redox state, the decrease in methionine content and increase in abundance of protein mixed <b>disulphides</b> are associated with the life expectancy of flies, and are indicative of enhanced oxidative stress during aging...|$|R

25|$|The first {{experiment}} on spatial optical solitons {{was reported in}} 1974 by Ashkin and Bjorkholm in a cell filled with sodium vapor. The field was then revisited in experiments at Limoges University in liquid carbon <b>disulphide</b> and expanded in the early '90s with the first observation of solitons in photorefractive crystals, glass, semiconductors and polymers. During the last decades numerous findings {{have been reported in}} various materials, for solitons of different dimensionality, shape, spiralling, colliding, fusing, splitting, in homogeneous media, periodic systems, and waveguides. Spatials solitons are also referred to as self-trapped optical beams and their formation is normally also accompanied by a self-written waveguide. In nematic liquid crystals, spatial solitons are also referred to as nematicons.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are held}} in their {{tertiary}} structure by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). Epistatic interactions occur whenever one mutation alters the local environment of another residue (either by directly contacting it, or by inducing changes in the protein structure). For example, in a <b>disulphide</b> bridge, a single cysteine {{has no effect on}} protein stability until a second is present at the correct location at which point the two cysteines form a chemical bond which enhances the stability of the protein. This would be observed as positive epistasis where the double-cysteine variant had a much higher stability than either of the single-cysteine variants. Conversely, when deleterious mutations are introduced, proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby as stabilising interactions are destroyed the protein still functions until it reaches some stability threshold at which point further destabilising mutations have large, detrimental effects as the protein can no longer fold. This leads to negative epistasis whereby mutations that have little effect alone have a large, deleterious effect together.|$|E
25|$|Galectins are {{a family}} of {{proteins}} defined by their binding specificity for β-galactoside sugars, such as N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-3GlcNAc or Galβ1-4GlcNAc), which can be bound to proteins by either N-linked or O-linked glycosylation. They are also termed S-type lectins due to their dependency on <b>disulphide</b> bonds for stability and carbohydrate binding. There have been 15 galectins discovered in mammals, encoded by the LGALS genes, which are numbered in a consecutive manner. Only galectin-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12 and -13 {{have been identified in}} humans. Galectin-5 and -6 are found in rodents, whereas galectin-11, -14 and -15 are uniquely found in sheep and goats. Members of the galectin family have also been discovered in other mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, nematodes, sponges, and some fungi. Unlike the majority of lectins they are not membrane bound, but soluble proteins with both intra- and extracellular functions. They have distinct but overlapping distributions but found primarily in the cytosol, nucleus, extracellular matrix or in circulation. Although many galectins must be secreted, {{they do not have a}} typical signal peptide required for classical secretion. The mechanism and reason for this non-classical secretion pathway is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino acid level {{as well as on the}} <b>disulphide</b> bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E
25|$|For ricin to {{function}} cytotoxically, RTA must be reductively cleaved from RTB {{in order to}} release a steric block of the RTA active site. This process is catalysed by the protein PDI (protein <b>disulphide</b> isomerase) that resides in the lumen of the ER. Free RTA in the ER lumen then partially unfolds and partially buries into the ER membrane, where it is thought to mimic a misfolded membrane-associated protein. Roles for the ER chaperones GRP94, EDEM and BiP have been proposed prior to the 'dislocation' of RTA from the ER lumen to the cytosol {{in a manner that}} utilizes components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD normally removes misfolded ER proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. Dislocation of RTA requires ER membrane-integral E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, but RTA avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with ERAD substrates because of its low content of lysine residues, which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin. Thus, RTA avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins (destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes). In the mammalian cell cytosol, RTA then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and their co-chaperones, as well as by one subunit (RPT5) of the proteasome itself, that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation, which de-purinates ribosomes, thus halting protein synthesis.|$|E
