40|$|Growth by {{molecular}} beam epitaxy of MnSb on InP(001) has been studied over a range of substrate temperatures (250 - 425 degrees C) and Sb:Mn flux ratios (2 : 1 to 8 : 1). Two growth phases were observed, their predominance mainly dependent on substrate temperature. These {{have been identified as}} MnSb (found preferentially at low temperatures) and InSb (found preferentially at high temperatures). The latter phase forms due to In out-diffusion from the substrate, leading to a granular film with increased total thickness and a very rough buried interface. This reaction only occurs in the presence of both Mn and Sb incident fluxes: when exposed to an Sb flux alone, very small islands of InSb are formed at the surface of InP due to residual In clusters but no disruption of the substrate occurs. No such effect was observed for growth on GaAs (001) and (111) B. Implications for the growth of <b>hybrid</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>systems</b> for semiconductor spintronics are discussed.

This paper reviews mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation of growth, structure and pattern formation for <b>epitaxial</b> <b>systems,</b> using an island dynamics/level set method for growth and a lattice statics model for strain. Epitaxial growth involves physics on both atomistic and continuum length scales. For example, diffusion of adatoms can be coarse-grained, but nucleation of new islands and breakup for existing islands are best described atomistically. In heteroepitaxial growth, mismatch between the lattice spacing of the substrate and the film will introduce a strain into the film, which can significantly influence the material structure, for example leading to formation of quantum dots. Technological applications of epitaxial structures, such as quantum dot arrays, require a degree of geometric uniformity that {{has been difficult to}} achieve.

Besides being able to induce the 1 D crystallization of new material, it is highly beneficial if the NPs {{can be used to}} dictate the position and diameter of the final nanowire structure. To achieve well-defined NP arrays of varying diameter and pitch distances for nanowire growth, it is necessary to understand and control the effect that a pre-growth annealing process may have on the pre-defined NP arrays. Recently, it has been demonstrated that silver (Ag) may be an alternative to using gold (Au) NPs as seed for particle-seeded nanowire fabrication. This work brings light onto the effect of annealing of Au, Ag and Au-Ag alloy metal NP arrays in two commonly used <b>epitaxial</b> <b>systems,</b> the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and the metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The metal NP arrays are fabricated with the aid of electron beam lithography on GaAs 100 and 111 B wafers and the evolution of the NPs with respect to shape, size and position on the surfaces is studied after annealing using scanning electron microscopy. We find that while the Au NP arrays are found to be stable when annealed up to 600 °C in a MOVPE system, a diameter and pitch dependent splitting of the particles is seen for annealing in a MBE system.
