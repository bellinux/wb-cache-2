The objective of the present study is to introduce a validation approach assessing the correlation between the FIRISK and seven independent <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> and quantifying the similarity in their spatial distribution in a study area (Attica, Greece) characterized by high fire risk and fragmented land-use structure. The FIRISK correlated positively with four out of seven <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> (average <b>fire</b> size, percentage of burnt area on the total municipal area, percentage of cropland and pastures burnt in each fire) in a non-linear fashion. Cluster analysis indicates that FIRISK spatial distribution was coherent with variables describing both fire size and the use of land endangered by fire. Results of the present study demonstrate that the FIRISK is a reliable <b>indicator</b> of <b>fire</b> risk within the ESAI framework.

30|$|As forests burn, the {{physiological}} responses of trees to stress or injury {{result from a}} combination of simultaneous processes, and fire behavior can vary from tree to tree. More frequent and robust indicators of the 1985 event suggest that fire severity and intensity affect tree responses. Post-fire measurements of char height, crown scorch, tree mortality, basal sprouting, and fire severity (e.g., Ramage et al. 2010, Lazzeri-Aerts and Russell 2014) coupled with increment cores collected several years later from standing redwoods could link growth and anatomical indicators to specific drivers. Although tree size may influence responsiveness to fire due to bark thickness (Sillett et al. 2015), epicormic sprouting (Abbott 1987), and ability to survive fire (Ramage et al. 2010, Douglas and Bendure 2012), no size-related trend in <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> is evident in this study of trees 93 cm f-DBH to 481 cm f-DBH.

40|$|Gaining {{insight into}} the origins and nature of fire use in the Palaeolithic has {{important}} implications for the understanding of various aspects of hominin behaviour and cognition. Major topics within the field of fire research include: the timing of the first (controlled) use of fire, fuel use (bone vs. wood) and its relation to different tasks and adaptive strategies, pyrotechnology (i. e. fire use as a tool), and cooking. Within the study of fire use in the Palaeolithic there is a strong reliance on patterns of presence and absence of <b>fire</b> <b>indicators.</b> Therefore, understanding the way in which fire traces are affected by taphonomy and being able to correctly identify them in the Palaeolithic record are important prerequisites for valid interpretations of hominin fire-related behaviour and cognition. While most other post-depositional processes are nowadays taken into account, diagenesis (i. e. chemical processes) is often still overlooked. This is unfortunate since a recent study by Braadbaart et al. (2009) indicated that exposure to alkaline conditions (pH values > 7) can severely affect the preservation potential and temperature signal of charcoal in the archaeological record. This will affect interpretations based on patterns of <b>fire</b> <b>indicators,</b> as well as interpretations linking temperatures to specific uses of fire. This thesis aims to contribute to the study of fire use in the Palaeolithic by exploring the influence of pH on the preservation potential and temperature signal of charred bone and wood. Bone and wood samples were charred to a range of temperatures (unheated, 190 º, 250 º, 340 º, 600 ºC), and exposed to pH solutions representing acidic (pH 3), neutral (pH 7) and alkaline (pH 12) conditions. The samples were incubated for a period of approximately six months. After incubation, the samples were analysed to determine chemical composition (using XRF and TGA), temperature signal (using TGA and reflectance analysis), and mass loss. Results were compared to existing data on unexposed charred bone and wood. This study indicated that charred bone and wood are affected by all pH values, resulting in mass loss, fragmentation, and colour and consistence changes. Temperature inferences for charred bone, based on TGA and/or colour, were deemed unreliable. Temperature inferences for charred wood, based on reflectance analysis, were only affected under alkaline conditions. Based on these results, it is suggested that more attention should be paid to the influence of pH on the preservation potential of fire remains, and that pH should be recognised as a legitimate cause for absence of evidence of fire use...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} spatio-temporal {{patterns of}} wildfires in Greece using a multidimensional statistical framework based on non-parametric correlations, principal component analysis, clustering and stepwise discriminant analysis. Specifically, we assess the frequency, seasonal profile, severity and land-use type of 135 178 wildfires which occurred between 2000 – 2012 in Greece, {{one of the}} countries most affected by fire in Europe. Our results show that both the number of fires and the average size of the area covered by fire show a specific seasonal pattern with a marked increase during the dry season. Principal component analysis identifies three dimensions linked with the main type of land-use affected by the fires: (i) medium and large fires primarily affected landscapes composed of forests, mixed woodlands/shrublands and croplands; (ii) small fires mainly affected fragmented landscapes, i. e. those with mosaics of different crops, market gardens and non-vegetated, abandoned or marginal areas; (iii) fires affecting wetlands and pastures occurred particularly in late summer and showing medium-low severity. Hierarchical clustering highlights similarities in spatio-temporal patterns between <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> (ignition date, burnt land cover classes, fire size, fire density). K-means clustering allows us to distinguish between low-severity fires occurring in the wet season from intense and frequent fires occurring in the dry season but with distinct land-use selectivity.

40|$|Sphagnum peatlands in the oceanic-continental {{transition}} zone of Poland are currently influenced by climatic and anthropogenic factors {{that lead to}} peat desiccation and susceptibility to fire. Little {{is known about the}} response of Sphagnum peatland testate amoebae (TA) to the combined effects of drought and fire. To understand the relationships between hydrology and fire dynamics, we used high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological data to reconstruct 2000 years of mire history in northern Poland. We employed a new approach for Polish peatlands – joint TA-based water table depth and charcoal-inferred fire activity reconstructions. In addition, the response of most abundant TA hydrological <b>indicators</b> to charcoal-inferred <b>fire</b> activity was assessed. The results show four hydrological stages of peatland development: moderately wet (from ∼ 35 BC to 800 AD), wet (from ∼ 800 to 1390 AD), dry (from ∼ 1390 to 1700 AD) and with an instable water table (from ∼ 1700 to 2012 AD). Fire activity has increased in the last millennium after constant human presence in the mire surroundings. Higher fire activity caused a rise in the water table, but later an abrupt drought appeared {{at the onset of the}} Little Ice Age. This dry phase is characterized by high ash contents and high charcoal-inferred fire activity. Fires preceded hydrological change and the response of TA to fire was indirect. Peatland drying and hydrological instability was connected with TA community changes from wet (dominance of Archerella flavum, Hyalosphenia papilio, Amphitrema wrightianum) to dry (dominance of Cryptodifflugia oviformis, Euglypha rotunda); however, no clear <b>fire</b> <b>indicator</b> species was found. Anthropogenic activities can increase peat fires and cause substantial hydrology changes. Our data suggest that increased human fire activity was one of the main factors that influenced peatland hydrology, though the mire response through hydrological changes towards drier conditions was delayed in relation to the surrounding vegetation changes...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{observable}} increase in the fitting of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on the roofs of buildings in the UK over the last decade. The origin of some fires in domestic and commercial properties {{has been attributed to}} PV systems. This thesis examines the ability of fire examiners to recognise and record details of fires believed to have originated from PV systems, as well as investigating the effect of internal heating in direct current (DC) isolators to the point at which they fail. National fire data was examined along with the methods for collecting and collating these data. This clarified that national fire data cannot identify the specifics of electrical fires. Validity of these data was then tested by identifying the confidence and competence in the recognition of the origin of fire, (especially when associated with PV systems), of some fire staff responsible for collecting fire data. This suggests that some fire scenes examiners are not confident in their own ability to recognise fires originating from PV systems. Evidence for fires occurring in PV systems in Kent between 2009 and 2014 was then examined, including a cold case forensic review of the evidence. This provided an indication that a potential common point of failure, which may lead to fire originating from a PV system, was to be found within the DC section of the PV circuits and probably within the DC isolator switch itself. Experimentation revealed that internal heating of a terminal connection can lead to changes of the phase of the insulating material, causing failure of structural integrity and therefore allowing an arc to be established. Observable post <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> associated with this mechanism of failure have been identified as well as hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of isolator insulating material. Finally, areas for further experimental research and training of fire staff are suggested as well as the modification of recording mechanisms and building regulations...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} and testing facility {{has been developed}} at Simtars to allow the spontaneous combustion testing of coal on a large scale. In this adiabatic reactor, the coal particle sizing is closer to that which {{could be found in}} the goaf and therefore the reaction is more likely to simulate the underground situation. This allows aspects of the spontaneous combustion process and methods for detecting a heating to be investigated which cannot be done in an operational mine. Up to 18 tonnes of run of mine or crushed coal is loaded into the reactor and allowed to self-heat while the temperature and gas profiles within the coal pile are monitored. The gases evolved from the coal are analysed using a fixed gas monitor system and gas chromatography to determine which of the common mine <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> and ratios can be used to predict the onset and progress of coal heatings. Benchmarking of the inherent propensity of a coal to spontaneously combust at both the large- and laboratory-scale is also possible by comparing the sample against previously tested samples. It has been found that the coal particle size affects both the time it takes for the coal to react and the location of the developing heating. The heatings generate approximately one metre from the inlet but in the crushed coal case do not progress to an advanced heating stage until the ‘hot spot’ migrates towards the coal surface where there is an increased oxygen supply. Physical properties such as the compressive strength of the coal also affect the heating size and the time it takes for a heating to develop. Higher strength coals appear to oxidise more slowly and therefore take longer to self-heat as oxidation of the coal is the heat-generating step in the spontaneous combustion process. The best indicators {{of the state of the}} heating were found to be CO make and Graham’s ratio which are independent of air flow. Investigation of a potential spontaneous combustion should begin as soon as the CO make or Graham’s ratio exceed the background levels.

40|$|The {{experience}} {{of anxiety and}} worry often carries negative connotations. However, anxiety can be a highly motivating force which encourages behavioural action in response to legitimate limiting the likelihood of adverse consequences when this focuses on identifying ways and means of averting such negative outcomes. Yet, these processes can also disrupt preparation for potential threat. When anxiety is unrelated to real sources of danger, and worry focuses only on {{the negative consequences of}} a potential threat, they may in fact reduce preparatory behaviours for potential danger by motivating people to avoid actions that remind them of potential threats. This presentation will briefly outline the possible causal relationships between anxiety, worry, and behavioural preparedness for potential threat. These theoretical perspectives will then be discussed in relation to recent data collected from bushfire affected communities. Following the February 6 th fires in Roleystone, Kelmscott and Red Hill in Perth this year, a collaborative project was launched to sample 400 community members within these fire affected areas. The scale and locations of the February 6 fires meant that affected areas included rural, semi-rural, and urban regions. By sampling from these different areas {{we have been able to}} perform unique comparisons of individuals within these different communities in terms of their level of anxiety and worry about bushfires, their level of bushfire preparedness, and symptoms of traumatic stress following the event. Questionnaire measures used in this study included a modified version of the Worry Domains Scale to examine individual differences in the tendency to worry about a number of different areas in life (e. g. finances, environment), including the risk of bushfires. General anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety inventory which examines the frequency andintensity with which people experience symptoms of anxiety. The Acute Stress Disorder Scale was also used to examine the presence of posttraumatic stress symptoms following the recent <b>fires.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of preparatory actions before the fire, and behaviours on the day of the fire were also gathered via interviews.

This prototype was then applied to the Portuguese situation considering a management unit: the forest intervention zone (FIZ) Arade-Alte/ S. B. Messines. Results of the model for the FIZ allowed obtaining a complete management plan, with detailed data on the several aspects important for management. Alternative scenarios of profit maximization for each one of the farm types were also achieved, as well as, optimum biodiversity and fire risk scenarios. Future developments and being now carried out, that will improve this model in a more complex framework, and that will try to apply it to other management areas of the PROTECT partners...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} extreme fire weather days (EFWD) in Victoria for the twenty-nine fire seasons (November to April) from 1970 / 71 to 1998 / 99 {{inclusive}} {{was carried out}} in order to provide objective information about: (a) the frequency of EFWDs; and (b) the synoptic patterns and wind directions associated with EFWDs. Data from East Sale, Melbourne Airport, Mt Gambier and Mildura were used to calculate the fire danger rating using the McArthur Mark 4 grasslands fire danger meter and the McArthur Mark 5 forest fire danger meter. Days that had a fire danger rating of 50 or greater were labelled EFWDs. The number of EFWDs per year was compared to the number of high risk Haines Index days (HRHID), another <b>fire</b> risk <b>indicator.</b> It was found that EFWDs occur most in the northwest and central parts of Victoria while Melbourne Airport had the largest number of extreme days. Extreme fire danger ratings usually occurred at 1500 h local time, however at Melbourne Airport, extreme grass fire danger ratings usually occurred at 1200 h local time. Most extreme events occurred in north to northwesterly flow. HRHIDs were found to be well correlated with EFWDs...|$|R
40|$|Fire is {{the most}} {{important}} natural disturbance driving vegetation dynamics in the Mediterranean Basin. However, studies relating fire-induced tree responses to both fire severity and plant traits are still scarce in this region. We aimed to investigate such relationships further and to develop simple models that could help improve forest management in these fire-prone ecosystems. We compiled data from 16 fire sites in different regions and used models to relate post-fire responses of 4155 trees from 14 species with <b>fire</b> severity <b>indicators</b> and tree characteristics. The influence of several spatiotemporal factors at the site level was also considered. Results showed that pine mortality was usually high and mainly determined by fire severity, whereas plant traits played a minor role. In contrast, mortality of broadleaved trees was usually low, even for high-severity fire, but most trees were top-killed. Stem mortality increased with fire severity and decreased with bark thickness and tree size. The models for predicting individual mortality of pines and stem mortality of broadleaves showed very good performance, including when validated against independent datasets. Our results suggest {{that it is possible to}} accurately predict the most common post-fire responses of Mediterranean species based on simple fire and tree characteristics. © IAWF 2013.
