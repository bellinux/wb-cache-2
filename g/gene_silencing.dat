5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>silencing</b> aims {{to reduce}} the {{production}} of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. <b>Gene</b> <b>silencing</b> experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression.|$|E
40|$|Destruxin A (DA), a cyclodepsipeptidic {{mycotoxin}} of entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, has anti-immunity activity against insects, but {{the mechanism}} of immune regulation is not clear yet. In our previous experiment, the significant expression changes of Bm_nscaf 2838 _ 045, Bm_nscaf 2674 _ 066, and Bm_nscaf 2767 _ 133 genes in a silkworm’s hemocytes were found, which suggested that these genes might be involved in insect’s innate immunity. In the current experiment, the silkworm cell line Bm 12 was used to survey the expression levels of these genes after the cells were treated with DA and the transcription factors BmRel, BmRelish 1 and BmRelish 2 were silenced by specific siRNA. The results indicated that, after the cells were treated by DA, the gene expression level of BmRelish 2 was significantly downregulated, but BmRel and BmRelish 1 were not changed. The results also showed that the gene expression levels of Bm_nscaf 2838 _ 045 and Bm_nscaf 2674 _ 066 had similar phenomena, i. e., downregulation with individual BmRelish 1 <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> or DA treatment, upregulation with combination of BmRelish 1 <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> and DA treatment, upregulation with individual BmRelish 2 <b>gene</b> <b>silence,</b> and downregulation with combination of BmRelish 2 <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> plus DA treatment, but no changes in the BmRel <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> combined with DA treatment. For the Bm_nscaf 2767 _ 133 gene, the downregulated expressions were found in individual BmRelish 2 <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> or DA treatment, upregulation in the combination treatment of BmRelish 2 <b>gene</b> <b>silence</b> plus DA, and the individual treatment of BmRel or BmRelish 1 silence. It is suggested that expressions of the Bm_nscaf 2838 _ 045 and Bm_nscaf 2674 _ 066 genes {{are closely related to}} the Imd signal pathway, but Bm_nscaf 2767 _ 133 genes might involve in both Toll and Imd pathways. Furthermore, the BmRelish 1 gene acts as an activator and the BmRelish 2 gene acts as a repressor for both Bm_nscaf 2838 _ 045 and Bm_nscaf 2674 _ 066 gene expressions. It also implies that DA may participate in the splicing process of BmRelish where BmRelish 2 was promoted.

40|$|Aim. Ubiquitn (UBB) and {{proteasome}} 7 subunit (PSMB 7) <b>genes</b> <b>silencing</b> {{is interesting}} {{due to the}} crucial role of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system (UPS) in turnover of functional proteins, which controls program cell death (apoptosis, auophagy). Methods. We used methods of RNA interference (for UBB and PSMB 7 <b>genes</b> <b>silencing),</b> fluorescence microscopy and real-time PCR. Results. It was shown that small interference RNA injection in cell culture decreased ubiquitin expression in 2, 4 (P 0. 05). At the same time, there was augmented level of necrotic cells with no change in number of apoptotic cells. Cells with signs of autophagy were much augmented as consequence of UPS impairment and intracellular proteins accumulation, which degrade in lysosomes. Conclusions.

5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing,</b> which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> {{process that}} is {{controlled}} by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

50|$|Reciprocal {{silencing}} on {{the population}} level has been proposed {{as a means of}} allopatric speciation following a polyploid event. Allopatric speciation occurs when two populations of the same species become spatially separated and accumulate enough genetic differences to lose the ability to interbreed. As redundant <b>genes</b> are <b>silenced</b> in allopolyploids there is the potential for rapid genetic differences to accumulate through reciprocal silencing. These differences can lead to the loss of ability to interbreed between separated populations at a faster rate than other methods of speciation, given the relative speed with which <b>genes</b> are <b>silenced</b> following a polyploid event. Faster still, redundant <b>genes</b> can be <b>silenced</b> through epigenetic means, although the importance of this phenomenon is not fully understood.|$|R

Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|R
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is a {{vital part}} of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material, especially in plants where it may also prevent the self-propagation of transposons. Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses. Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood, it was known that induced <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> in plants could spread throughout the plant in a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting. This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter. In response, many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response. These include viral proteins that bind short double-stranded RNA fragments with single-stranded overhang ends, such as those produced by dicer. Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria. These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that downregulates any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process.|$|E
5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs <b>gene</b> <b>silencing.</b> The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

50|$|A {{different}} approach targets {{the production of}} a protein required {{for the development of the}} disease. RNAi was discovered to be a natural mechanism for <b>silencing</b> <b>genes</b> through cleavage and degradation of mRNA, first discovered in C. elegans in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello. Genes encode the information necessary for cells to synthesize proteins, and proteins made abnormally cause many human diseases. When a mutant <b>gene</b> is <b>silenced,</b> the cell stops making the abnormal protein specified by that gene, potentially improving the course of the disease.

25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} <b>genes</b> are <b>silenced</b> by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have}} been attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor <b>genes</b> <b>silenced</b> by DNA methylation.|$|R

40|$|The fate of {{redundant}} genes {{resulting from}} genome duplication is poorly understood. Previous studies indicated that ribosomal RNA genes from one parental origin are epigenetically silenced during interspecific hybridization or polyploidization.

25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> targeting transposons. Transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> is {{a product}} of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
