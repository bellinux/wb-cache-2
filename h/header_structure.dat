Visualization of its metadata would benefit digital forensic investigator to view embedded data including corrupted image where no graphics can be displayed in order to assist in evidence collection for cases such as child pornography or steganography.

40|$|Spreadsheets {{are widely}} used to manage {{statistical}} data, and a massive amount of valuable spreadsheets are now public as open data. Spreadsheet headers may contain hierarchical structures, and values in spreadsheets are associated with not only headers at the same column or row but also those corresponding to their ancestors. When integrating spread-sheets with other datasets, {{it is necessary to}} extract hierar-chical <b>header</b> <b>structures</b> and associate this information with values. In this paper, we propose three algorithms to extract hier-archical structures from spreadsheets based on the relation of values. Since our algorithms are focused only on values, they can be applied to heterogeneous spreadsheets such that the structures of row or column headers are not explicitly in-dicated by specic header features such as space, indent, or keywords. Our experiments showed that the F-measure for extractions with one of our algorithms is 0 : 73. The runtimes of our algorithms are practical for most datasets; therefore, they can process 995 real spreadsheets of up to 105 rows, which accounts for 99. 5 % of 1000 spreadsheets randomly chosen from PublicData. eu, within 16200 seconds (the aver-age runtime per le is 16. 28 seconds). 1...|$|R

30|$|Consistency: {{determines how}} {{agreeable}} {{the data is}} with the overall structure of its type. Incompatibility of attributes in terms of measurement rates or header labeling between datasets results in outliers, leading to an inconsistent result from an application. The attributes of consistency are as follow. ① Header frame consistency: consistency of the header frame of the device. This could be categorized into: persistence of PMU header that states whether the PMU <b>header</b> <b>structure</b> is consistent over time, and persistence of PDC header that states whether the PDC <b>header</b> <b>structure</b> is consistent over time. ② Data frame consistency: consistency of data frames of the device. This could be categorized into: persistence of PMU data frame that states whether the PMU data frame structure is consistent over time, and persistence of the PDC data frame that states whether the PDC data frame structure is consistent over time. ③ Order consistency of data frames: whether {{the order in which}} the data frames are recorded is consistent in the device. ④ Consistency in compliance to standards recommended for PMU and all the devices associated with it. ⑤ Consistency of reporting rate: whether data reporting rate is consistent across all devices.|$|E

To retrieve information about created or received packets, network services interact with packets through a 'packet facade' (Figure 2 b, interaction 2). Through this packet facade, standardized packet attributes (metadata) can be added, updated or requested.

40|$|AbstractIEEE 802. 11 n {{standard}} is introduced {{to enhance the}} throughput to more than 100 Mbps at the MAC service access point. This high throughput is achieved through several enhancements at the physical and MAC layers. Frame aggregation is a key enhancement at the MAC later in which multiple frames are concatenated and then sent in one channel access. In error free channels the 802. 11 n MAC service data unit aggregation (A-MSDU) performs better than the MAC protocol data unit aggregation (A-MPDU) due to its smaller headers. However, the performance of A-MSDU at erroneous channels is poor {{due to lack of}} sub-frames integrity check. In this paper, we proposed an A-MSDU frame aggregation with sub-frame integrity check and retransmission at the MSDU level without altering the original MAC frames <b>header</b> <b>structure.</b> The results show that the proposed scheme improves the system performance in terms of throughput and delay even under highly erroneous channels...|$|E

For a meaningful role in Big Data analytics, the facts reported in these tables must {{be brought into}} a uniform framework.

Experimental evaluations substantiate the algorithmic approach to processing heterogeneous tables.

The novel optical correlator <b>structures</b> for <b>header</b> recognition, are based on the use of Opto-VLSI processors, fibre Bragg gratings, and arrayed waveguide gratings, respectively, and are demonstrated at IOGb/s by generating auto-correlation functions of high peaks whenever the optical header bit pattern matches a predetermined pattern in the lookup table, while for other bit patterns, only low intensity (below a threshold level) cross-correlation functions are produced. As a result, these structures eliminate the bottleneck that exists in the conventional ortical packet switching networks, thus greatly enhancing the performance of such networks...|$|R
