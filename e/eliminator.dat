5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead <b>Eliminator</b> uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the <b>Eliminator,</b> but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E

50|$|A {{subset of}} the Ferengi culture are known as <b>Eliminators,</b> and they {{routinely}} hire themselves out as assassins to anyone {{willing to pay for}} their services. Most Ferengi, however, view <b>Eliminators</b> as eccentric at best (since <b>Eliminators</b> appear to enjoy the sport of killing more than the profits gained thereby) or dangerous psychopaths at worst (killing potential customers, which is not good for business), and avoid them whenever possible.|$|R

5|$|Timmy makes a wish {{to star in}} his own movie trilogy (In parodies of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter). He is {{interrupted}} by Jorgen, who takes his fairy godparents away and sends Timmy home. When he gets there, Timmy's parents and school friends don't remember him, and an <b>Eliminator</b> appears after Timmy calls out his own name. In an alley, the <b>Eliminator</b> projects a space vortex through its mouth to inhale Timmy. Jorgen saves him, and the two arrive at Fairy World. Meanwhile, the fairies are hidden as gumballs inside a truck stop bar by Jorgen. After being blown into a bubble from a kid's mouth, Cosmo takes Wanda and Poof {{with him as he}} floats away. The rest of the fairies use Cosmo's method as their escape plan.|$|E

The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an <b>Eliminator,</b> dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

ECW promoter Paul Heyman quickly abandoned plans to give them a sadism and masochism character and instead booked them as an unstoppable force in the ECW tag team division. They were managed by Jason.

25|$|Drift (or windage) is {{the term}} for water {{droplets}} of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge.

A typical drift <b>eliminator</b> provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift <b>eliminator</b> can greatly reduce water loss and potential for Legionella or water treatment chemical exposure.|$|E
