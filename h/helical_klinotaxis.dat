40|$|Observations of free-swimming Thiovulum majus cells {{show that}} these {{bacteria}} exhibit a phobic response {{as well as}} true chemotaxis in oxygen gradients. Both phenomena of their chemotactic behavior are integrated into a single model of <b>helical</b> <b>klinotaxis,</b> which is demonstrated by computer simulations. Many motile prokaryotes are able to accumulate in regions which are favorable for their physiological adaptations. In or-der to achieve this they have to sense physical parameters (e. g., light, magnetic fields, gravity, or concentrations of chemical substances) of their environment. If bacteria change their mo-tility patterns in response to chemical substances, this behavior is called chemotaxis. Following the terminology given by Dusenbery (9), chemotaxis can on principle be realized in two different ways. True taxis is given if responses to chemical gradients are directional, i. e., the moving direction of the or-ganism is correlated to {{the direction of the}} chemical gradient. If the responses are undirectional, the behavior is called...|$|E
