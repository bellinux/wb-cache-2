5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, <b>ecophysiology,</b> and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, <b>ecophysiology,</b> metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of lianas has punctuated {{the history of}} land plants, with the angiosperm lineages representing the most recent stage of liana exploration. The model of lianas as fast-growing, disturbance-loving plants emerges largely from the function of eudicot and magnoliid angiosperms. This chapter looks at some specific properties of ecology and function, derived from functional aspects of stem hydraulics, which appear to be restricted to lianas. It charts the broad picture of xylem structure and function of angiosperm lianescence framed by {{what is known about}} the comparative <b>ecophysiologies</b> of eudicot/magnoliid and monocot lianas from temperate/ tropical zones. The chapter reviews the liana hydraulic paradigm illustrated by these angiosperm climbers. Finally, it explores how other climber lineages differ from generally accepted views about how lianas function hydraulically...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of organic substrates represents {{an important part}} of the global carbon cycle and affects its global change through CO 2 release. In temperate forests, deadwood represents a large carbon stock, its amount and decomposition is crucial for ecosystem biodiversity and functioning. The fungi are omnipresent powerful decayers in all terrestrial ecosystems. Their ability to decompose all deadwood compounds, mainly lignocellulose, is highly important. Without fungi, the wood decompositions and the release of withheld nutrients back to nutrient cycles couldn't be performed. While many studies were concerned with the estimation of decomposition rates of deadwood, still deeper knowledge about microbial decomposition processes and the diversity of saproxylic species and their interaction is needed. The fungi are still underrepresented in dead wood studies. This study had two main objectives. First was to describe the fungal community on downed deadwood of Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba in natural forest of Salajka in the Czech Republic, to reflect the substrate changes during the different decay stages, and to link the enzyme activities to fungal community composition and their described <b>ecophysiologies.</b> Second aim was to describe the fungal communities on standing and downed dead logs of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the already {{characterized}} and potential two-component protein sequences {{that exist in the}} nine complete and seven partially annotated cyanobacterial genome sequences available (as of May 2005) showed that the cyanobacteria possess a much larger repertoire of such proteins than most other bacteria. By analysis of the domain structure of the 1, 171 potential histidine kinases, response regulators, and hybrid kinases, many various arrangements of about thirty different modules could be distinguished. The number of two-component proteins is related in part to genome size but also to the variety of physiological properties and <b>ecophysiologies</b> of the different strains. Groups of orthologues were defined, only a few of which have representatives with known physiological functions. Based on comparisons with the proposed phylogenetic relationships between the strains, the orthology groups show that (i) a few genes, some of them clustered on the genome, have been conserved by all species, suggesting their very ancient origin and an essential role for the corresponding proteins, and (ii) duplications, fusions, gene losses, insertions, and deletions, as well as domain shuffling, occurred during evolution, leading to the extant repertoire. These mechanisms are put in perspective with the different genetic properties that cyanobacteria have to achieve genome plasticity. This review is designed to serve as a basis for orienting further research aimed at defining the most ancient regulatory mechanisms and understanding how evolution worked to select and keep the most appropriate systems for cyanobacteria to develop in the quite different environments that they have successfully colonized...|$|R
25|$|Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of {{environmental}} physiology {{is on the}} one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology {{and on the other hand}} one of the oldest.

It is roughly synonymous with <b>ecophysiology,</b> crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.|$|E

40|$|In estuaries, rivers, {{streams and}} coastal marine waters, the {{nitrogen}} cycle can be substantially altered due to anthropogenic activities resulting in increased amounts of inorganic nitrogen (mainly nitrate). Here, {{we want to}} unravel the key organisms responsible {{for the removal of}} this anthropogenically derived inorganic nitrogen via benthic dissimilatory nitrate reduction in estuarine sediments in a tidal flat. Detailed insight in the community structure of the whole bacterial diversity as well as the denitrifying guild was generated through barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and the genes nirK and nirS, two key genes encoding dissimilatory nitrite reductase. The interrogation of both nir genes is important, as most studies only include one or the other, led by a false assumption that the denitrifiers carrying either gene have different <b>ecophysiologies.</b> In addition, the relative abundance of the nirK and nirS denitrifiers in the total community was assessed via qPCR. Unfortunately, attempts to develop novel, broad range primers for both nir genes based on newly available whole genomes sequences failed due to their extreme divergence. Consequently, we used widely applied primers. An enormous diversity was revealed by 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing, with the majority of all OTUs belonging to the Proteobacteria and unclassified phyla. Multiple OTUs (6 %) belonged to the Planctomycetes phylum, which may indicate that anammox, another important nitrate removing process, could possibly play a role in dissimilatory nitrate removal in this ecosystem. Preliminary data showed that diversity and abundance are higher for nirS genes compared to nirK genes...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{different}} strategies {{to cope with}} drought, involving alternative <b>ecophysiologies</b> and different levels of plasticity. These strategies are critical for species of limited distribution, which are especially vulnerable to the current rates of rapid environmental change. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the water strategy of two species with limited distribution, Cneorum tricoccon L. and Rhamnus ludovici-salvatoris Chodat., and evaluate their interpopulation variability along an aridity gradient to estimate their vulnerability to a drier climate. We measured different ecophysiological traits influenced by drought - stomatal conductance, maximum photochemical efficiency of photosynthesis II, carbon isotope ratio and chlorophyll concentration - in two climatically contrasting years, before and during summer drought. Both species were vulnerable to drought at the aridity limit of the gradient, but showed contrasting water strategies: while C. tricoccon was consistent in its water conservation strategy across the aridity gradient, R. ludovici-salvatoris was not, displaying higher and more variable stomatal conductances and being able to increase water-use efficiency at the most xeric sites. Changes in length and intensity of drought events may favor one species' strategy to the detriment of the other: C. tricoccon is more vulnerable to chronic and prolonged droughts, whereas short but acute droughts might have a stronger effect on R. ludovici-salvatoris. In those communities where these two species coexist, such different strategies might lead to changes in community structure under climate change scenarios, with unknown cascade effects on ecosystem functioning. © 2013 The Author 2013.

40|$|To broaden {{perspectives}} and stimulate research on migration, I survey the bird species that breed {{in the northern}} hemisphere and migrate to the southern hemisphere and species that migrate within the southern hemisphere, comparing routes, seasonal patterns and life histories. Differences {{in the area and}} latitudinal extent of land masses on {{the two sides of the}} Equator influence patterns of bird migration. In contrast to birds breeding in the northern hemisphere, no land or freshwater birds breeding in the southern hemisphere migrate between continents and only a very few cross the Equator. Furthermore, except for shorebirds, few northern intercontinental migrants reach the southern hemisphere in regions south of the equatorial forest belt, because most encounter, and are filtered out by, suitable habitats en route. Australasia is an extreme case because only 10 land or freshwater migrants from the northern hemisphere regularly occur there (most are uncommon or rare) compared with 42 in Africa and 28 in South America, and no Australasian breeders enter Asia beyond Wallace’s Line. Historical geographical and oceanic barriers may be an additional factor limiting migration to Australasia. There are generally no or only slight differences in frequencies of austral migrants within foraging guilds or families across southern continents. Exceptions are rallids, with more migrants in Africa, and cuckoos and nectarivores, with more Old World than New World migrants. Austral migrations are of shorter distances than most of those of the northern hemisphere, and they appear to vary more with respect to routes and patterns. Breeding and non-breeding ranges frequently overlap. Partial migration is common, but there is no evidence that it differs in frequency from that in northern regions. Because climate is generally milder and drier in the southern hemisphere, rainfall is a more important influence on migration than in the north especially in some nomadic birds, but temperature also predicts migration frequency and pathways for many species. These patterns are similar across southern continents, but each continent has its own characteristics. Southern hemisphere migrants seem to display <b>ecophysiologies</b> and orientation mechanisms similar to those found in northern hemisphere species, but very few southern species have been studied. I argue that the variation present among southern hemisphere migrations provides exceptional opportunities to understand the evolution and ecology of migration systems. In order to take advantage of these systems, we need to focus on variation in movement behaviour, on associated syndromes of traits, and on the particular features of natural selection and ecology setting thresholds that lead to the diverse migration patterns observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{inspiration for}} this dissertation was {{to resolve the}} over two hundred year-old debate regarding the trophic nature of the leafless and non-photosynthetic species of Pyrola, Pyrola aphylla Sm. (Ericaceae). To do this, I integrated the use of molecular methods and the analysis of stable isotopes to examine the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the carbon acquisition strategies of P. aphylla {{as well as its}} closely related and leafy-green sister taxa P. picta Sm. and Chimaphila umbellata (L.) W. Bartram. My goals were to: 1) determine if P. aphylla was fully mycoheterotrophic and therefore dependent on mycorrhizal fungi to meet all of its carbon and nutrient demands (Chapter 1); 2) identify the mycorrhizal fungi associated with P. aphylla and P. picta (Chapter 2); 3) determine if P. picta and C. umbellata were partially mycoheterotrophic meeting their carbon demands both through photosynthesis and mycorrhizal fungi (Chapters 2 and 3) and; 4) examine the role of increased shade on the degree of mycoheterotrophy in P. picta and C. umbellata (Chapter 3). 	The novel findings of this work include a new example of full mycoheterotrophy in Ericaceae based on the similarity of the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values of P. aphylla to other full mycoheterotrophs that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Surprisingly, unlike all other fully mycoheterotrophic plants within Ericaceae based on the DNA sequence analysis of the fungi associated with P. aphylla, this species has not specialized on a particular lineage of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Rather, P. aphylla associates with a phylogenetically broad suite ectomycorrhizal fungi and there is little to no overlap in fungal symbionts of this species across its geographic range. Pyrola picta was also found to associate with a diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi indicating that fungal specificity is not necessarily a precursor to the loss of photosynthesis among mycoheterotrophic plants. Furthermore, both P. picta and C. umbellata have nitrogen stable isotope values that are indistinguishable from fully mycoheterotrophic species in Ericaceae, while their bulk leaf carbon stable isotope values are most similar to autotrophic plants in the forest understory. These findings led to the final experiment of this dissertation where leaf soluble sugars of P. picta and C. umbellata were extracted and analyzed for their carbon stable isotope values. This experiment was conducted on populations of P. picta and C. umbellata {{in the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. In the field, light availability and access to mycorrhizal networks were manipulated to determine if the degree of dependency on fungal carbon gains in the two test species increased under decreased light availability. This study revealed that P. picta and C. umbellata have disparate <b>ecophysiologies</b> that are potentially related to their C-acquisition strategies. Based on the out-put of an isotope mixing model C. umbellata showed no indications of mycoheterotrophy while P. picta is partially mycoheterotrophic, but a decrease in light availability did not significantly increase the fungal-C sink strength of this species. 	Based on the outcomes of this dissertation, future work on mycoheterotrophic plants should include: examining within an coevolutionary framework the significance of fungal specificity for mycoheterotrophy, determining what factors-environmental or physiological, lead to the nitrogen stable isotope values of these plants, and gaining a better understanding of the biochemical pathways and transformations of carbon and nutrients in this symbiosis. The tribe Pyroleae provides a useful group with which to explore these lines of research, as it is the only group of eudicots found thus far that contains species across the spectrum from autotrophy to full mycoheterotrophy...|$|R
