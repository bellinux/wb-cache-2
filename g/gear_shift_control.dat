40|$|Vehicles {{equipped}} with Automated Manual Transmissions (AMT) for <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>control</b> show many advantages {{in terms of}} reduction of fuel consumption and improvement of driving comfort and shifting quality. In order to increase both performance and efficiency, an important target {{is focused on the}} minimization of the typical torque interruption during the gear shift, especially in front of the conventional automatic transmission. Recently, AMT are proposed to be connected with planetary gears and friction brakes, {{in order to reduce the}} torque gap during the gear change process. This paper is focused on a block-oriented simulation methodology developed in Matlab/Simulink/ Stateflow environment, able to simulate the performance of a complete FWD powertrain and in particular to predict dynamic performance and overall efficiency of the AMT with innovative Torque Gap Filler devices (TGF). A comparison between traditional Manual Transmission (MT) system and AMT with TGF device is presented, focusing in particular on the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>control</b> strategies able to improve the performance of these systems. Some dynamic simulations are discussed in order to validate the proposed model and to simulate performance and limitations of this mechanical solution. Copyright © 2008 SAE International...|$|E

40|$|Control {{theory is}} often {{interested}} in studying stability and stabilization of dynamical systems in an infinite time horizon. However, in many practical situations, {{focusing on the}} system behavior in a finite time interval {{is more important than}} requiring the system to reach a given equilibrium. Analysis on finite time horizon can be useful, for example, to study state and output transients due to disturbances or {{to examine the effects of}} sudden changes of the state variable due to external or internal system perturbations. Moreover, some systems naturally evolve in a finite time interval, as for example earthquakes or animal and vegetal systems. Furthermore, only qualitative behavior of dynamical systems are usually taken into account, as in Lyapunov Asymptotic Stability and classic Input-Output Lp-Stability. In many applications though, it is necessary to provide specific bounds to the system state and/or output variables. When dealing with linear models obtained linearizing nonlinear systems around an equilibrium, for example, it is important to keep the state trajectory close to the equilibrium point to avoid the effects of nonlinearity; the presence of variables physical constraints, like actuators saturations, is another example. Two different concepts of stability over a finite time horizon are dealt with in this thesis, namely Finite-Time Stability (FTS) and Input-Output Finite-Time Stability (IO-FTS). Their aim is to provide quantitative bounds, during a finite time interval, on the state and output trajectories, respectively. These quantitative bounds can be very useful for hybrid systems, e. g. Switching Linear Systems (SLSs), which present jumps in the state space in particular instants of time called resetting times. Hybrid systems exhibit both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics and are used to model systems such as a thermostat turning the heat on and off, a server switching between buffers in a queueing networks, the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>control</b> in a car. This thesis extends the FTS results already present in the previous literature, i. e. necessary and sufficient condition to check finite-time stability, to a larger class of hybrid systems, namely SLS. It also copes with the very useful case of uncertainty on the resetting times. In the context of IO-FTS, this thesis provides necessary and sufficient conditions to check the stability of Linear Time Varying (LTV) systems and sufficient conditions to check the stability of SLSs, also in the case of resetting times not a priori known. For both FTS and IO-FTS, dfferent stabilization problems are solved for SLSs and LTV systems. The new concept of Structured IO-FTS is introduced, which makes possible to limit the effort on the actuators by introducing quantitative bounds on the control inputs. Some applications are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control techniques...|$|E

To lower the production cost, Terra Crusher had two channel radio system included, instead of the three channel set offered with T-Maxx. Lacking this extra gear meant that reverse was done with a differential gear. T-Maxx reversed by using a <b>gear</b> <b>shift,</b> <b>controlled</b> by third channel. In Terra Crusher, however, one of the central gears had a set of differential gears inside. When the brake is applied, this gear is also stopped, and differential engaged to rotate the connected gears in opposite direction.

However, it also deals with the subject of microcontroller and electronics implementation in automobiles {{as well as a}} description of the Formula Student event, at which the electronics will are used. During a short project course in the late fall / early winter of 2005, the author came in contact with computer aided design of electronics and programming of microcontrollers. Design of the hardware for the steeringwheel was also begun. This led to the fact that a bachelors thesis project focusing on the software and hardware for the steering wheel and the software for the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> and clutch <b>control</b> ECU as well as the implementation of these systems in the racing car, would make a natural follow-up. The hardware in the steering wheel consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) with various components mounted, the main one being the Atmel AVR AT 90 CAN 128 microcontroller. This microcontroller is an excellent choice for use in autmotive systems because it offers a wide variety of functions, among these a CAN controller and it is affordable and it is easy to use. The hardware for the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> and clutch <b>control</b> unit was made by two members of the previous year's Formula Student team, as an upgrade for this year's car.

40|$|Heavy duty powertrains {{are complex}} systems with {{components}} from various domains, different response times during transient operations and different efficient operating ranges. To ensure efficient transient {{operation of a}} powertrain, e. g. with low fuel consumption or short transient duration, {{it is important to}} come up with proper control strategies. In this dissertation, optimal control theory is used to calculate and analyze efficient heavy duty powertrain controls during transient operations in different applications. This is enabled by first developing control ready models, usable for multi-phase optimal control problem formulations, and then using numerical optimal control methods to calculate the optimal transients. Optimal control analysis of a wheel loader operating in a repetitive loading cycle is the first studied application. Increasing fuel efficiency or reducing the operation time in such repetitive loading cycles sums up to large savings over longer periods of time. Load lifting and vehicle traction consume almost all of the power produced by a diesel engine during wheel loader operation. Physical models are developed for these subsystems where the dynamics are described by differential equations. The model parameters are tuned and fuel consumption estimation is validated against measured values from real wheel loader operation. The sensitivity of wheel loader trajectory with respect to constrains such as the angle at which the wheel loader reaches the unloading position is also analyzed. A time and fuel optimal trajectory map is calculated for various unloading positions. Moreover, the importance of simultaneous optimization of wheel loader trajectory and the component transients is shown via a side to side comparison between measured fuel consumption and trajectories versus optimal control results. In another application, optimal control is used to calculate efficient <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>controls</b> for a heavy duty Automatic Transmission system. A modeling and optimal control framework is developed for a nine speed automatic transmission. Solving optimal control problems using the developed model, time and jerk efficient transient for simultaneous disengagement of off-going and engagement of in-coming shift actuators are obtained and the results are analyzed. Optimal controls of a diesel-electric powertrain during a <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> in an Automated Manual Transmission system are calculated and analyzed in another application of optimal control. The powertrain model is extended by including driveline backlash angle as an extra state in the system. This is enabled by implementation of smoothing techniques in order to describe backlash dynamics as a single continuous function during all <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> phases. Optimal <b>controls</b> are also calculated for a diesel-electric powertrain corresponding to a hybrid bus during a tip-in maneuver. It is shown that for optimal control analysis of complex powertrain systems, minimizing only one property such as time pushes the system transients into extreme operating conditions far from what is achievable in real applications. Multi-objective optimal control problem formulations are suggested in order to obtain a compromise between various objectives when analyzing such complex powertrain systems...|$|R
