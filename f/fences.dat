5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution.

5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} <b>fences</b> to the river.

The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E

5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some <b>fences,</b> but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the course has been widened to allow more <b>fences</b> to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 <b>fences</b> were jumped.|$|E
