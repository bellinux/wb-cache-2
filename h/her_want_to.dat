500|$|Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its {{composition}} {{and noted that}} the disco and gospel genres are where middle-aged woman can [...] "thrive", whereby Carey [...] "fits in unsurprisingly well". He was, however, critical {{of the decision to}} include Wale on the song. Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required. Conversely, fashion designer Donatella Versace, a friend of Carey's, told Vogue that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as [...] "poetry", and that it made <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get up and dance [...] "all summer".|$|E

500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which {{proved to be the}} sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Other comics by Romano Scarpa {{have the}} Queen in her {{youthful}} form.

The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more [...] "honorable" [...] witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds" [...] (I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti), Jiminy Cricket is deeply enamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good, but the Queen refuses to be redeemed and orders her soldiers to steal the throne the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old woman. Eventually, the Queen is defeated by another witch Tardona and Snow White is saved.

She takes on many forms trying to thwart them in various ways, and one-by-one the dwarfs sacrifice their lives, until only Dopey remains but he manages to get hold of magical water that brings back all of them to life. The freed fairy's magic makes the cavern collapse down on the helpless Queen to make sure she will never hurt anyone again. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Birtch Ring" [...] (I Sette Nani e l'anello di betulla by Romano Scarpa), the Queen learns about the eight Dwarf named Ginger (Zenzero), who has left the his companions to go in search of fortune traveling the world, and transforms into a pixie named Fagottina to send him home and sow discord among his brothers. The Queen also transforms into a pixie, named Fogliolina, in [...] "Snow White and Easter in the Woods" [...] (Biancaneve e la Pasqua nel bosco), where, after her attempt to kill Snow White with magic is foiled by woodland creatures, she is so enraged that she calls upon the infernal powers to [...] "take her" [...] and her castle burns into flames and crumbles [...] around her. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Wolf's Cliff" [...] (I Sette Nani e la balza del lupo), she sends three of her bandit minions (Bragia, Sghembo and Schidione) to kidnap Snow White. [...] "Snow White and the Bewitched Dress" [...] (Biancaneve e l'abito stregato) has the Queen magically disguise herself as an old gypsy to give Snow White a cursed dress and capture her, then start her work on the spell to rid of the dwarfs and all the forest creatures. But Dopey infiltrates her castle, frees Snow White, and locks up the Queen in her laboratory set ablaze, after which the whole castle is consumed by fire and explodes after the dwarf and the princess escape.|$|E
6000|$|She went on {{for some}} little time longer, she appealed to them with all the {{strength}} of her honest purpose to help her to make this possible good thing a real good thing, not to suspect, not to be hard on her--"and my husband"--not to make a difficult thing impossible, {{it was so easy}} to do that, and when she finished she was in the happiest possession of her meeting. They came thronging round her with flushed faces and bright eyes, they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come near <b>her,</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> touch <b>her,</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assure <b>her</b> that for her they were quite prepared to live in any kind of place.

2500|$|When {{making the}} song, Ochi {{wanted to make}} it the {{signature}} song on Force, as well as creating a work similar to her 2008 single [...] "Ai o Komete Hanataba o", that had been used for her previous tie-up with a TBS drama, Edison no Haha. After creating the song, Ochi felt the song was very representative of how she felt as a person at that moment. The song, as well as much of the Force album, was inspired by someone close to Ochi who made <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> expose more of her true self.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson pegged [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as a {{follow-up}} song to her 2004 track [...] "Because of You" [...] and the album's [...] "most personal" [...] record, saying that [...] "once you've worked through {{that and you}} find love {{and the kind of}} happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You. She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, [...] "I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!". Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were {{in stark contrast to the}} cliché about people with [...] "abandonment issues" [...] dating [...] "losers". She also said that [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Susan Hill {{from the}} Daily Star {{reported}} that Lynsey {{would become the}} next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office {{to tell her that}} she would be involved in a [...] "really big storyline", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's [...] "steeliness" [...] helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she heard his voice which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes <b>her</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid.|$|E
