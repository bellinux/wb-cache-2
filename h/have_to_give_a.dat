25|$|Baker never {{publicly}} contested {{the close}} points verdict which Douglas, who scored a second-round knockdown over him, won in their Olympic final. But, in a 1952 interview, {{he claimed that}} Douglas’s father had refereed the fight, leading to widespread suspicion of a dodgy decision, but in fact John Douglas senior was only at ringside, from where refs worked in those days, to present the medals, {{in his role as}} president of the ABA. The real ref was Eugene Corri who did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> casting vote as the two judges agreed that Douglas was a narrow winner. Douglas Jr, his father and his younger brother, Cecil ('Pickles') were all prominent referees and officials in the ABA, the last also being the leading referee in the professional sport in the 1930s. Douglas also won the 1905 ABA Middleweight title.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 March, President Chirac {{announced}} in {{an address to the}} nation that he would promulgate the law, but asked the government {{at the same time to}} prepare a new law including two modifications: the trial period would be reduced to one year, and employers would now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> reason for the dismissal of the employment. However, Chirac did not specify whether this reason would be a juridical motive or a simple letter without any juridical value. He also asked employers not to start using the contract until these modifications came into force, but suggested no means of enforcement. Chirac's paradoxical call (officially promulgating the law while unofficially asking at the same time for its suspension) has only baffled both partisans and opponents of the text. The president's move was widely analyzed by the press as support for his prime minister Dominique de Villepin against his 2007 election rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was the leader of Chirac's political party, the UMP. Villepin had declared that he would have resigned had Chirac refused to promulgate the law. Some 2,000 students were waiting on the Place de la Bastille for Chirac's address to the nation. After hearing it, they carried out a night demonstration, which collected as many as 6,000 persons between the Hôtel de Ville and the Opéra. A few hundred demonstrators continued until four in the morning.|$|E

60|$|Yet {{the escape}} was narrow. The {{government}} only missed censure in the Lords {{by a majority}} of one. In the Commons the evening was anxious. “You will see,” says Mr. Bruce (Feb. 20, 1872), “that we got but a small majority last night. The fact is that our victory in the Lords made men slack about coming to town, and Glyn got very nervous {{in the course of the}} evening. However, Palmer’s and Gladstone’s speeches, both of which were excellent, improved the feeling, and many who had announced their intention to go away without voting, remained to support us.” At one moment it even looked as if the Speaker might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> casting vote, and he had framed it on these lines: “I have concluded that the House while it looks upon the course taken by government as impolitic and injudicious, is not prepared at the present juncture to visit their conduct with direct parliamentary censure.”(253) In the end, ministers had a majority of twenty-seven, and reached their homes at three in the morning with reasonably light hearts.|$|E
60|$|While I {{was writing}} The Way We Live Now, I was called {{upon by the}} proprietors of the Graphic for a Christmas story. I feel, with regard to literature, {{somewhat}} as I suppose an upholsterer and undertaker feels when he is called upon to supply a funeral. He has to supply it, however distasteful it may be. It is his business, and he will starve if he neglects it. So have I felt that, when anything {{in the shape of}} a novel was required, I was bound to produce it. Nothing can be more distasteful to me than to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> relish of Christmas to what I write. I feel the humbug implied by the nature of the order. A Christmas story, in the proper sense, should be the ebullition of some mind anxious to instil others with a desire for Christmas religious thought, or Christmas festivities,--or, better still, with Christmas charity. Such was the case with Dickens when he wrote his two first Christmas stories. But since that the things written annually--all of which have been fixed to Christmas like children's toys to a Christmas tree--have had no real savour of Christmas about them. I had done two or three before. Alas! at this very moment I have one to write, which I have promised to supply within three weeks of this time,--the picture-makers always require a long interval,--as to which I have in vain been cudgelling my brain for the last month. I can't send away the order to another shop, but I do not know how I shall ever get the coffin made.|$|E
6000|$|In {{his latest}} work ("An Introduction to the Classification of Animals,") {{published}} in 1869, Professor Huxley unhesitatingly adopts the [...] "well founded doctrine, {{that life is}} the cause and not the consequence of organization." [...] In his celebrated article [...] "On the Physical Basis of Life," [...] however, he maintains, that life is a property of protoplasm, and that protoplasm owes its properties to the nature and disposition of its molecules. Hence he terms it [...] "the matter of life," [...] and believes that all the physical properties of organized beings are due to the physical properties of protoplasm. So far we might, perhaps, follow him, {{but he does not}} stop here. He proceeds to bridge over that chasm which Professor Tyndall has declared to be [...] "intellectually impassable," [...] and, by means which he states to be logical, arrives at the conclusion, that our [...] "thoughts are the expression of molecular changes in that matter of life which is the source of our other vital phenomena." [...] Not having been able to find any clue in Professor Huxley's writings, to the steps by which he passes from those vital phenomena, which consist only, in their last analysis, of movements of particles of matter, to those other phenomena which we term thought, sensation, or consciousness; but, knowing that so positive an expression of opinion from him will have great weight with many persons, I shall endeavour to show, with as much brevity as is compatible with clearness, that this theory is not only incapable of proof, but is also, as it appears to me, inconsistent with accurate conceptions of molecular physics. To do this, and in order further to develop my views, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> brief sketch of the most recent speculations and discoveries, as to the ultimate nature and constitution of matter.|$|E

It was a queer sort o' day in the fall, dry and hot as if thar might hev bin {{a fire in the}} woods, only thar wasn't no wind. Not a breath of air anywhar. The leaves of them alders hung straight as a plumb-line. Except for that thar stream and that thar wheel, nuthin' moved. Thar wasn't a bird on the wing over that canyon; thar wasn't a squirrel skirmishin' in the hull wood; even the lizards in the rocks stiffened like stone Chinese idols. It kept gettin' quieter and quieter, ontil I walked out on that ledge and felt as if I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> yell just to hear my own voice. Thar was a thin veil over everything, and betwixt and between everything, and the sun was rooted {{in the middle of it}} as if it couldn't move neither. Everythin' seemed to be waitin', waitin', waitin'. Then all of a suddin suthin' seemed to give somewhar! Suthin' fetched away with a queer sort of rumblin', as if the peg had slipped outer creation. I looked up and kalkilated to see half a dozen of them boulders come, lickity switch, down the grade. But, darn my skin, if one of 'em stirred! and yet while I was looking, the whole face o' that bluff bowed over softly, as if saying 'Good-by,' and got clean away somewhar before I knowed it. Why, you see that pile agin the side o' the canyon! Well, a thousand feet under that there's trees, three hundred feet high, still upright and standin'. You know how them pines over on that far mountain-side always seem to be climbin' up, up, up, over each other's heads to the very top? Well, Mr. Key, I SAW 'EM climbin'! And when I pulled myself together and got back to the mill, everything was quiet; and, by G--d, so was the mill-wheel, and there wasn't two inches of water in the river!" ...|$|E
60|$|And now as {{to gossip}} about this place. The Abyssinians are celebrated by {{travellers}} {{in their country}} as being an intelligent people. Intelligent {{is by no means}} the word, nor is sharp nor cute; they are simply the most extortionate thieves that the sun’s light ever shone on. Formerly the necessaries of life were extraordinarily cheap here. Mercher, the Tigre chief who acts as interpreter, tells me that, as an example, fowls could be purchased at forty for a dollar. I venture to say that, at the present moment, it is the dearest place in the habitable globe. I have seen three eggs offered for a dollar. This was, however, too much to be stood, and at present seven is the tariff; that is, as nearly as possible, eightpence apiece for very little eggs. An ordinary-sized fowl costs a dollar; and with great bargaining two very small and skinny ones can be obtained for that sum. Two pumpkins can be bought for a dollar: for a quart of milk a dollar is demanded, and I have seen it given. The commissariat give a dollar for about seventeen pounds of grain: if we buy it for our horses in the camp—which we are obliged to do, as there are no rations issued for our baggage-animals—we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> dollar for about twelve pounds. The price of a good mule before we came here was seven or eight dollars; this had risen to thirty-two or thirty-three, at which the 3d Cavalry bought a considerable number, and to thirty-seven, the average price at which Captain Griffiths, of the Transport Train, purchased a good many. General Merewether, however, by one of those masterly coups for which he is so distinguished, has suddenly raised the market price 25 per cent, by giving fifty dollars each for a lot of forty, among which were some very indifferent animals. After this, of course, fifty will be the current price, until General Merewether makes another purchase for the public service, after which there is no predicting the price at which they will probably arrive. It is all very well to say that they are cheaper here than they are in Egypt; that has, as far as I can see, nothing whatever to do with the question, any more than it would be to say they are cheaper than at the North Pole. The people were willing to sell them at thirty-seven dollars for picked animals; why, then, spoil the market by giving fifty? It is urged that we are in want of mules, and that, by offering even more than they ask, we shall induce them to send in larger quantities; but I cannot agree that it is so. We were before paying 700 per cent more than their ordinary price, and this would be sufficient temptation to owners of any mules within a hundred miles—and good mules are not common—to have brought them in. Every mule fit for the purpose would have come in, and by paying 900 per cent we can obtain no more. One source of irritation has been, I am happy to say, if not put down, at least rebuked. After the parade the other day the Commander-in-chief rode to the church, attended by most of the mounted officers. The usual demand of a dollar a-head was made, which Sir Robert very properly refused to pay, and through the interpreter said a few appropriate words to the priest as to money-changers in the temple. He refused, he said, upon that ground to allow the charge of a dollar a-head to be paid, but promised that upon his return from Magdala he would present an altar-cloth at the church.|$|E
