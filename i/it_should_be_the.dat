5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only trophy {{that they should be}} hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942, with Allied forces {{advancing}} through Tunisia, the North African {{campaign was}} coming to a close; victory in North Africa being imminent, discussions began between the Allies over what their next objective should be. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of France, while the British believed that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> island of Sardinia, as did General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January 1943 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, met at the Casablanca conference and settled the debate: the island of Sicily would be the Allies' next objective. The invasion and occupation of Sicily would benefit the Allies by opening Mediterranean sea routes for Allied shipping and allowing Allied bombers to operate from airfields that were much closer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was eventually decided on for the invasion, and planning began in February. The British Eighth Army, {{under the command of}} General Bernard Montgomery, would land on the south-eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse, while the US Seventh Army, commanded by General George Patton, would land on the south coast and move towards the port of Palermo on the western corner of the island. The landings would be made simultaneously along a 100-mile (160-km) stretch of the island's south-eastern coastline.|$|E

Democrats supported the joint resolution 58% and 39% in the Senate and House respectively. The resolution asserts the authorization by the Constitution of the United States and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism. Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.|$|E
25|$|Rutledge {{also argued}} that if either house of the {{legislature}} {{was to have the}} sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Senate. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to think clearly about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded {{that there would be no}} danger of the Senate ruling the country.|$|E

500|$|An {{exemplar of}} Ruisdael's early style is Dune Landscape, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} works, dated 1646. It breaks with the classic Dutch tradition of depicting broad views of dunes that include houses and trees flanked by distant vistas. Instead, Ruisdael places tree-covered dunes prominently at centre stage, with a cloudscape concentrating strong light on a sandy path. The resulting heroic effect is enhanced by the large size of the canvas, [...] "so unexpected in the work of an inexperienced painter" [...] according to Irina Sokolova, curator at the Hermitage Museum. The art historian Hofstede de Groot said of Dune Landscape: [...] "It is hardly credible that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> work of a boy of seventeen".|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} called 64 separate witnesses. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame {{claimed that}} {{their involvement in}} the coup was {{due to a lack}} of development in the Gabonese army. [...] Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if [...] "that is the only reason for your coup d'état, you deserve a severe penalty." [...] Essone said that almost all Gabonese military officers knew of an imminent coup beforehand, while Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, and at the request of some [...] "putschists". He reasoned that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference, an assertion which Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Marc Ekoh, shared. Ekoh had served as Foreign Minister during the coup. The Gabonese actor said that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> French troops being tried, not he and his comrades: [...] "If we'd been able to put up a few more Gabonese soldiers against the French, we'd have won— and we shouldn't be here today." ...|$|E

[...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue.

500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is everything you could want in a game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E
