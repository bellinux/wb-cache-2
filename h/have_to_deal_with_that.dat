6000|$|Now, {{this year}} is a memorable anniversary. It is fifty years within a month or two, since the Crown took over the Government of India from the old East India Company. Whether {{that was a good}} move or a bad move, it would not become me to discuss. The move was made. (A voice, [...] "It was a good move.") My veteran friend says {{that it was a good}} move. I hope so. But at the end of fifty years we are at rather a {{critical}} moment. I read in The Times the other day that the present Viceroy and Secretary of State had to deal with conditions such as the British in India never before were called upon to face. (A voice, [...] "That is so.") Now, many of you sitting around me at this table are far better able to test the weight of that statement, than I can pretend to be. Is it true that at the end of fifty years since the transfer to the Crown, we have to deal with conditions such as the British in India never before were called upon to face? ("Yes.") I cannot undertake to measure that; but what is clear is that decidedly heavy clouds have suddenly risen in our horizon, and are darkly sailing over our Indian skies. That cannot be denied. But, gentlemen, having paid the utmost attention that a man can in office, with access to all the papers, and seeing all the observers he is able to see, I do not feel for a moment that this discovery of a secret society or a secret organisation involves any question of an earthquake. I prefer to look upon it, to revert to my own figure, as clouds sailing through the sky. I do not say you will not have to take pretty strong measures of one sort and another. Yes, but strong measures in the right direction, and with the right qualifications. I think any man who lays down a firm proposition that all is well, or any man who says that all is ill--either of those two men is probably wrong. Now this room is filled, and genially filled, with men who have had enormous experience, vast and wide experience, and, not merely passive experience, but that splendid active experience which is the real training and education of men in responsibility. This room is full of gentlemen with these qualifications. And I will venture to say that the theories and explanations that could be heard in the palace of truth from all of you gentlemen here, would be countless in their differences. I hear explanations of the present state of things all day long. I like to hear them. You think it may become monotonous. No: not at all; because there is so much, I will not say of random variety, but there is so much independent use of mind upon the facts that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with,</b> <b>that</b> I listen with endless edification and instruction. But, I think, and I wish I could think otherwise with all my heart--that to sum up all these theories and explanations of the state of things with which we have to deal, you can hardly resist a painful impression that there is now astir in some quarters a certain estrangement and alienation of races. ("No no.") Gentlemen, bear with me patiently. It is our share in the Asiatic question.|$|E
60|$|This is {{to speak}} of {{literature}} at its highest; and with the four great elders who are still spared to our respect and admiration, with Carlyle, Ruskin, Browning, and Tennyson before us, it would be cowardly to consider it at first in any lesser aspect. But while we cannot follow these athletes, while we may none of us, perhaps, be very vigorous, very original, or very wise, I still contend that, in the humblest sort of literary work, we have it in our power either to do great harm or great good. We may seek merely to please; we may seek, having no higher gift, merely to gratify the idle nine days' curiosity of our contemporaries; or we may essay, however feebly, to instruct. In each of these we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> remarkable art of words which, {{because it is the}} dialect of life, comes home so easily and powerfully to the minds of men; and since that is so, we contribute, in each of these branches, to build up the sum of sentiments and appreciations which goes by the name of Public Opinion or Public Feeling. The total of a nation's reading, in these days of daily papers, greatly modifies the total of the nation's speech; and the speech and reading, taken together, form the efficient educational medium of youth. A good man or woman may keep a youth some little while in clearer air; but the contemporary atmosphere is all-powerful in the end on the average of mediocre characters. The copious Corinthian baseness of the American reporter or the Parisian chroniquear, both so lightly readable, must exercise an incalculable influence for ill; they touch upon all subjects, and on all with the same ungenerous hand; they begin the consideration of all, in young and unprepared minds, in an unworthy spirit; on all, they supply some pungency for dull people to quote. The mere body of this ugly matter overwhelms the rare utterances of good men; the sneering, the selfish, and the cowardly are scattered in broad sheets on every table, while the antidote, in small volumes, lies unread upon the shelf. I have spoken of the American and the French, not because they are so much baser, but so much more readable, than the English; their evil is done more effectively, in America for the masses, in French for the few that care to read; but with us as with them, the duties of literature are daily neglected, truth daily perverted and suppressed, and grave subjects daily degraded in the treatment. The journalist is not reckoned an important officer; yet judge of the good he might do, the harm he does; judge of it by one instance only: that when we find two journals on the reverse sides of politics each, on the same day, openly garbling a piece of news for the interest of its own party, we smile at the discovery (no discovery now!) as over a good joke and pardonable stratagem. Lying so open is scarce lying, it is true; {{but one of the things}} that we profess to teach our young is a respect for truth; and I cannot think this piece of education will be crowned with any great success, so long as some of us practise and the rest openly approve of public falsehood.|$|E

50|$|Weeks {{before he}} leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, his mother dies of scarlet fever; Victor buries himself in his {{experiments}} {{to deal with the}} grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about 8 ft in height and proportionally large. Despite his intentions, the beautiful creation of his dreams is instead hideous, with yellow eyes and skin that barely conceals the muscle tissue and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees and dismisses him when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. Victor does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> issue, however, because the monster has escaped.|$|E
5000|$|A {{publisher}} in a pub/sub system may {{assume that a}} subscriber is listening, when {{in fact it is}} not. A factory may utilize a pub/sub system where equipment can publish problems or failures to a subscriber that displays and logs those problems. If the logger fails (crashes), equipment problem publishers won't necessarily receive notice of the logger failure, and error messages will not be displayed or recorded by any equipment on the pub/sub system. It should be noted that this is also a design challenge for alternative messaging architectures, such as a client/server system. In a client/server system, when an error logger fails, the system will receive an indication of the error logger (server) failure. However, the client/server system will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> failure by having redundant logging servers online, or by dynamically spawning fallback logging servers. This adds complexity to the client and server designs, {{as well as to the}} client/server architecture as a whole. However, in a pub/sub system, redundant logging subscribers that are exact duplicates of the existing logger can be added to the system to increase logging reliability without any impact to any other equipment on the system. In a pub/sub system, the feature of assured error message logging can be added incrementally, subsequent to implementing the basic functionality of equipment problem message logging.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{theoretical}} approach but also practice of planning environmental protection brought forth {{the issue of}} citizens’ participation. Active citizens’ participation is particularly stressed at the local environmental protection system because local community is considered as a framework of citizens’ everyday life. At the same, capacity for citizens’ participation is determined by interactions of three factors: a) general social conditions, b) characteristics of environmental protection system and c) characteristics of citizens’ environmental awareness. The analysis, {{based on the results}} of the empirical research, is focused on role of citizens as social actors in environmental protection system at the local community level (city of Novi Sad). The research starts from the premise that although there is an elementary citizens’ environmental awareness, its manifest dimension is not well developed primarily due to the to lack of tradition in political participation, but also inadequate cooperation with relevant institutions within the system, as well as hierarchy of everyday life problems that citizens <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> for the most of them, do not leave enough space and motives for the engagement of this kind.
