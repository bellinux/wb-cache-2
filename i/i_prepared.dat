25|$|With {{the death}} of the infirm and childless Charles II of Spain on 1 November 1700, the {{succession}} of the Spanish throne and subsequent control over her empire once again embroiled Europe in war—the War of the Spanish Succession. On his deathbed Charles II had bequeathed the entire Spanish inheritance to Louis XIV's grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou. This threatened to unite the Spanish and French kingdoms under the House of Bourbon—something unacceptable to England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold I, who had himself a claim to the Spanish throne. From the beginning, the Emperor had refused to accept the will of Charles II, and he did not wait for England and the Dutch Republic to begin hostilities. Before a new Grand Alliance could be concluded Leopold <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> to send an expedition to seize the Spanish lands in Italy.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E

2500|$|About the Gnostic Mass, Crowley {{wrote in}} The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, [...] "... the Ritual of the Gnostic Catholic Church ... <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> {{for the use}} of the O.T.O., the central {{ceremony}} of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church." [...] It is the single most commonly performed ritual at O.T.O. bodies, with many locations celebrating the Mass monthly or more frequently. Most O.T.O. bodies make some or all of these celebrations open to interested members of the public, so the Mass is often an individual's first experience of the O.T.O.|$|E

But recall the Fulham election, the peace ballot, Singapore, sanctions, Malta. The English will only learn by example. When I first heard of Hitler, when Ribbentrop came to see me, I thought they were all crazy. I think I brought Ramsay and Simon to meet Ribbentrop. Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen IV's death {{transformed}} the conflict into a plain Byzantine–Hungarian war over Sirmium and Dalmatia; both areas were re-occupied by the Hungarians in 1166, after achieving major successes against the imperial forces. In response, Manuel <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> a major counter-attack in 1167, appointing Andronikos, who months before {{had been named}} megas doux, commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy, {{as the leader of}} the campaign, although he also gave him detailed instructions for the campaign. The Hungarian army, commanded by the palatine Denis, met the Byzantine army near Zemun on the feast day of St. Procopius, 8 July 1167. As the battle was about to begin, according to Niketas Choniates Andronikos received a message from Manuel, who forbade the battle to take place on that day due to unfavourable astrological omens. Andronikos ignored the order and kept it secret from his officers. The ensuing Battle of Sirmium resulted in [...] "the most spectacular military victory [...] during Manuel's reign" [...] (Paul Magdalino), thanks in large part to the crucial intervention of the reserves under Andronikos himself.|$|E

2500|$|Around this time, Hou Cheng sent {{a trader}} to {{purchase}} 15 horses, {{but the man}} escaped with the horses and headed towards Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) {{with the intention of}} defecting to Liu Bei. Hou Cheng personally pursued the trader and retrieved all the horses. Lü Bu's officers then threw a feast to celebrate Hou Cheng's achievement. Hou Cheng prepared 5-6 hu (斛) of wine and about ten roasted hogs, and he presented half a hog and five dou (斗) of wine to Lü Bu before the feast started. He knelt down and said, [...] "With your grace, I managed to retrieve the stolen horses. The others came to congratulate me, so <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> some wine and hogs for a feast. I don't dare to start first, so now I present the food and wine to you." [...] Lü Bu was furious and he said, [...] "I banned alcohol, but you and the others dare to throw a party! Are you plotting with them to kill me?" [...] Hou Cheng was shocked and he immediately left. He also discarded the wine he prepared and returned the gifts he received from the other officers. Later, Hou Cheng, along with his colleagues Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續), captured Lü Bu's strategist Chen Gong and general Gao Shun, and led their troops to surrender to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. <b>I</b> <b>prepared</b> it myself. I haven't tried it myself when I heard that you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
