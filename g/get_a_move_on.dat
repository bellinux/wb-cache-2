25|$|Surely the cry to the stonewallers, {{who are now}} tiresomely {{occupying the}} Test crease, is {{to get on with}} it. 'Wake up and entertain, or you could be drawing {{unemployment}} benefits next week'...remind yourself that England's selectors dropped first Ken Barrington and later Geoff Boycott from England sides after they had refused to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Isolated punishments such as these clearly were not effective. Those drawbridges of defences were brought back {{as soon as it was}} thought to be politic.|$|E
500|$|Raymond Benson {{considered}} the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil. This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and do something"; Black notes {{that the image of}} St. George is an English, rather than British personification.|$|E
500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George had better <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and do something". Jeremy Black notes {{that the image of}} the [...] "latter-day St. George [...] again an English, rather than British image." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1940, the German Luftwaffe began bombing Southampton, {{where the}} OS offices were located. Crawford removed {{some of the}} old OS maps and stored them in the garage of his house at Nursling, while also unsuccessfully urging the Director-General to remove the OS' archive of books, documents, maps and {{photographs}} to a secure location. Subsequently, the OS headquarters were destroyed in the bombing, resulting in the loss of most of their archive. The refusal of the OS administration to take his warnings seriously infuriated Crawford, exacerbating his anger about the civil service's red tape and bureaucracy. In his words, [...] "trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> in the Civil Service was like trying to swim in a lake of glue". Resigning his membership in various British societies, he unsuccessfully tried to find employment abroad.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} at the Welsh Kennel Club {{championship}} {{two days after the}} programme aired, Kennel Club Chairman Ronnie Irving said that [...] "If this programme teaches us anything, I hope it will teach the 'purists' in some breeds that they simply must <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and realise that in these politically correct and well informed days, some old attitudes are simply no longer sustainable." [...] Maintaining that the majority of dogs are healthy he said that [...] "the roughly 90% of us who thankfully have healthy breeds must continue to guard against exaggeration and must bring pressure to bear on the laggards, otherwise we will – all of us – continue to be tarred with the same brush".|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense. What {{was there}} to be peeved about? I took the whole thing as a great compliment, proud to feel that any drink from my cellars could have {{produced}} such a majestic jag. It restores one's faith in post-war whisky. Besides, I couldn't be peeved at anything tonight. I am like a little child clapping its hands and dancing in the sunshine. For though it has been some time <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on,</b> Bertie, the sun has at last broken through the clouds. Ring out those joy bells. Anatole has withdrawn his notice." ...|$|R
50|$|Harry Stanley Griffiths (17 November 1912 - 11 June 1981) was an English footballer and {{baseball}} international. He played in defence for Everton between 1930 and 1935, but {{after failing to}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> game <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> to Port Vale between 1935 and 1947, playing 190 games in all wartime and peacetime competitions. Outside of the game he was a police offer, and later became a park keeper.|$|R
60|$|London is like {{nature in}} its vastness, simplicity, and deliberation, {{and if it}} hurried or worried, {{it would be like}} the {{precession}} of the equinoxes <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on,</b> and would shake the earth. The street events are few. In my nine or ten weeks' sojourn, so largely spent in the streets, I saw the body of only one accident worse than a cab-horse falling; but that was early in my stay when I expected to see many more. We were going to the old church of St. Bartholomew, and were walking by the hospital of the same name just as a cab drove up to its gate bearing the body of the accident. It was a young man whose bleeding face hung upon his breast and whose limp arm another young man of the same station in life held round his own neck, to stay the sufferer on the seat beside him. A crowd was already following, and it gathered so quickly at the high iron fence that the most censorious witness could hardly see with what clumsiness the wounded man was half-dragged, half-lifted from the cab by the hospital assistants, and stretched upon the ground till he could be duly carried into the hospital. It may have been a casualty of the many incident to alcoholism; at the best it was a result of single combat, which, though it prepared us in a sort for the mediaeval atmosphere of the church, was yet not of the tragic dignity which would have come {{in the way of a}} more heroical imagination.|$|R

6000|$|... "Your turn," [...] {{he called}} across. [...] "But just keep a-coming and don't look down. That's what got my goat. Just keep a-coming, that's all. And <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> It's almighty rotten." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{saddening}} me {{to a great}} extent, Comrade Jackson," [...] he said, [...] "this perpetual parting of the ways. When I {{think of}} the happy moments we have spent hand-in-hand across the seas, it fills me with a certain melancholy to have you flitting off in this manner without me. Yet there is another side to the picture. To me there is something singularly impressive in our unhesitating reply to the calls of Duty. Your Duty summons you to Philadelphia, to knock the cover off the local bowling. Mine retains me here, to play my part in the great work of making New York sit up. By the time you return, with a century or two, I trust, in your bag, the good work should, I fancy, be <b>getting</b> something of <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> I will complete the arrangements {{with regard to the}} flat." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Live Playoffs {{comprises}} episodes 15, 16, and 17 (the results show). The top 24 artists perform, {{with two}} artists from each team advancing {{based on the}} viewers' vote, and each coach completing their respective teams with their own choice.
