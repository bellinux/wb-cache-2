40|$|Activated factor Vila (FVTIa), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), D-dimer and thombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were {{measured}} to monitor coagulation status {{in patients with}} juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Subjects included 14 patients with systemic JCA, 16 with pauciarticular JCA and 16 with polyarticular JCA without disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombosis or liver dysfunction. All types of JCA showed an increase of FVIIa, D-dimer and TAT, indicating enhanced activation of coagulation. In systemic JCA only there was also characteristically an elevation of vWF: Ag. We conclude that all types of JCA constitute a state of subclinical hypercoagulopathy caused by tissue damage and that additionally systemic JCA involves a prothrombotic state associated with or precipitated by vasculitis.

40|$|DEK is {{a nuclear}} phosphoprotein implicated in {{oncogenesis}} and autoimmunity {{and a major}} component of metazoan chromatin. The intracellular cues that control the binding of DEK to DNA and its pleiotropic functions in DNA- and RNA-dependent processes have remained mainly elusive so far. Our recent finding that the phosphorylation status of DEK is altered during death receptor-mediated apoptosis suggested a potential involvement of DEK in stress signaling. In this study, we show that in cells committed to die, a portion of the cellular DEK pool is extensively posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation. Through interference with DEK expression, we further show that DEK promotes the repair of DNA lesions and protects cells from genotoxic agents that typically trigger poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. The posttranslational modification of DEK during apoptosis is accompanied by the removal of the protein from chromatin and its release into the extracellular space. Released modified DEK is recognized by autoantibodies present in the synovial fluids of patients affected by <b>juvenile</b> rheumatoid arthritis/juvenile <b>idiopathic</b> <b>arthritis.</b> These findings point to a crucial role of poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation in shaping DEK's autoantigenic properties and in its function as a promoter of cell survival...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 9 S {{patients}} withjuvenile idiopathic scoliosis have been analysed. This showed {{that between the}} ages offour and six there was a higher incidence in boys whereas between seven and nine years of age, the proportion ofgirls was higher. Regardless ofsex and age the majority ofthe curves were convex {{to the right and}} the single thoracic curve was the commonest pattern. Spontaneous resolution occurred in seven patients: in four the curves resolved within two years; in the three others the curves resolved in three, four and five years respectively. Forty-four per cent of all patients were managed conservatively and in 56 per cent spinal fusion was carried out. The characteristics of an idiopathic scoliosis first appearing between four and nine years of age and designated “juvenile idiopathic scoliosis ” are not dissimilar from those of scoliosis of later onset but, because of the different prognosis, separation from the other groups of “infantile ” and “adolescent ” is now generally accepted (James 1954; Wynne-Davies 1968; James 1 976). Despite the great progress made in the study of scoliosis over the past 20 years, little has been said. of <b>juvenile</b> <b>idiopathic.</b> scoliosis as an entity. The series previously published differ regarding the sex incidence, the area and the side of the curves.
