40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a device}} and {{a method for}} reverse flow elimination. The device for reverse flow elimination comprises a flux and flow direction detector, an <b>electric</b> water <b>valve,</b> a differential pressure gauge and a controller, wherein the flux and flow direction detector and the <b>electric</b> water <b>valve</b> are connected onto a bypass pipe in series; two ends of the differential pressure gauge are connected with two ends of the bypass pipe respectively; the flux and flow direction detector and the <b>electric</b> water <b>valve</b> are connected in parallel to the two ends of the differential pressure gauge after being connected in series; and the flux and flow direction detector, the <b>electric</b> water <b>valve</b> and the differential pressure gauge are separately connected with the controller. By adopting the device and the method for reverse flow elimination in the invention, no additional water flow needs {{to be added to}} offset the impact of reverse flow and what needs to do is to timely close the bypass pipe when reverse flow appears so that extra power consumption is not added to the central air conditioning system. 本发明公开了一种逆向回流消除装置及方法。其中逆向回流消除装置包括流量流向检测器、电动水阀、压差计以及控制器；其中：所述流量流向检测器和所述电动水阀以串联方式联接在旁通管上；所述压差计的两端分别与所述旁通管的两端联接，与所述流量流向检测器和所述电动水阀形成的串联联接构成并联；所述流量流向检测器、所述电动水阀和所述压差计分别与所述控制器联接。采用依据本发明的逆向回流消除装置及方法，不需要额外增加水流量来抵消逆向回流造成的影响，只需要在出现逆向回流时及时关闭旁通管即可，因此不会给中央空调系统增加额外的功耗。Department of Building Services EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 王盛卫Title in Traditional Chinese: 逆向回流消除裝置及方法Chin...|$|R

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} and {{optimize}} soft magnetic materials for use in solenoids for automotive components such as: <b>electric</b> injectors, <b>electric</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>electric</b> pumps [...] . etc. The work seeks to produce soft magnetic materials with higher magnetic permeability to produce higher magnetic forces in solenoids. Powder metallurgy was used to produce the magnetic solenoid parts with a wide array o f possible material combinations. Different mixtures o f Fe-Si, Fe-Co and Fe-Si-Co were developed. A cold-isostatic compacting technique was used with a pressure of 180 MPa. Then the samples were sintered twice at a temperature o f 1315 °C for 45 min after compacting, and after the final machining. Density, compression, hardness and microstructure were investigated for all samples {{before and after the}} second sintering. The results showed that the mechanical properties and the microstructure were improved after the second sintering. The magnetic density and intensity (B-H) was determined for each material. A sample o f each new material was sent to an American Lab. Finite element simulations were carried out using commercial software (ANSYS) to simulate the magnetic field o f a common rail electro-injector solenoid. The maximum magnetic force was determined for each developed material. Different models were built-up by varying the magnetic material properties and the working parameters such as the coil turn - current for a fixed gap between the armature and the back iron...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} part of the 20th century, Great Baddow grew through ribbon {{development}} towards Chelmsford and Galleywood. In 1936, Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company opened the Marconi Research Laboratory in Great Baddow (now BAE Systems Applied Intelligence Laboratories), bringing together their various radio, television and telephony research teams in a single location. As the electronics industry developed the campus expanded during the 1940s and 1950s to include research into radar, general physics, high voltage, vacuum physics and semiconductors. Great Baddow expanded considerably in the 1950s with the construction of Rothmans Estate, which provided housing for workers at Marconi's and English <b>Electric</b> <b>Valve</b> Company in Chelmsford.

5000|$|This {{work was}} further {{developed}} at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in the UK when they discovered mercury cadmium telluride {{could be used as}} a conductor that required much less cooling. Honeywell in the United States also developed arrays of detectors which could cool at a lower temperature, but they scanned mechanically. This method had several disadvantages which could be overcome using an electronically scanning system. In 1969 Michael Francis Tompsett at English <b>Electric</b> <b>Valve</b> Company in the UK patented a camera which scanned pyro-electronically and which reached a high level of performance after several other breakthroughs throughout the 1970s. [...] Tompsett also proposed an idea for solid-state thermal-imaging arrays, which eventually led to modern hybridized single-crystal-slice imaging devices.|$|E

The company was first registered as a separate company in Chelmsford, Essex in 1947 under Semyon Aisenstein. Its initial name was the Phoenix Dynamo Co Ltd, though it immediately changed its name to English <b>Electric</b> <b>Valve</b> Company Ltd. In 1959 Bob Coulson established Traveling-wave tube and Microwave tube sections and they were producing ceramic hydrogen thyratrons as well. By this time EEV was the largest hi-tech manufacturing company in the UK. A year later they won an EMMY award for outstanding contribution to Electronics Technology in developing the 4½"orthicon tube. In 1961 they acquired Associated Electrical Industries Valve business based in Lincoln. Sir Charles Oatley was a director of the company from 1966 to 1985. In 1962, EEV opened its first office in America in Buffalo, NY. The company has received 13 Queen's Awards for Technology in its history, most recently in 2006 for low light imaging devices and in 2004 for thyratrons for cancer radiotherapy treatment. Also, in 1972, they opened an office in Paris, France and in 1977 they opened another office in NY but this time in Elmsford. Keith Attwood, e2v's CEO from 1999 to 2013 led e2v through a short period as Marconi Applied technologies, and then in 2002 he led a management buy out supported by 3i following the collapse of the Marconi group. Following further growth under 3i, in 2004 the company floated on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Current Thermal cycling units fail to {{simulate}} the drinking behaviors, and oral balancing temperature. They cannot also simulate other oral conditions such as drink coloring, and chemicals like tea, coffee, carbonated and noncarbonated, citrus juices as well as alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks and also saliva and milk itself.  The main objective {{of this study is}} to introduce the designing and manufacturing the first Drinking Simulator Unit (DSU) that reproduces the thermal, color and chemicalcycling as well as the drinking behavior and oral temperature in lab conditions uniquely. Methods: The invented system generally has two parts: the hardware and the software parts. The hardware consists of the mechanical and electronic parts. The software part is responsible for controlling the heating and cooling systems, <b>electric</b> <b>valves,</b> the pumps, and automatic filling systems of tanks as well as the sensors of the machine. Results: DSU is the first unit can reproduce the thermal, color and chemical cycling as well as the drinking behavior and oral temperature in lab conditions. Different kinds of colored and acidic drinks and also other chemical materials such as bleaching substances as well as detergents and antiseptics used for dentistry, industrial and medical purposes can be tested by DSU. DSU has also to be considered as an appliance performing in-vitro researches on dental structures. Conclusion: The invented system can greatly improve and validate the results of such researches. ...|$|R
