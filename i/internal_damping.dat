[...] Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter (Dant). [...] This is called [...] "mid-range" [...] transfer, in contrast to the [...] "short range" [...] of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent. [...] Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.|$|E

Shrink or press fit components in built-up rotors are known sources of <b>internal</b> friction <b>damping.</b> The <b>internal</b> friction <b>damping</b> increases with speed, and becomes a destabilizing mechanism once the rotor speed exceeds its first critical speed. The main objective of this thesis is to find an improved procedure to accurately determine the correct numerical value of the <b>internal</b> friction <b>damping</b> for use in rotordynamic models. Tests show that the free-free rap tests yield a better way to obtain the numerical approximate values of the <b>internal</b> friction <b>damping</b> of built-up rotors. These results were verified by comparing the rotordynamic models with running tests. It was found that the <b>internal</b> friction <b>damping</b> increases with decreasing interference fit and with increasing rotor speed. The threshold speed of instability appears at low interference fits but not at tight fits...|$|R

This metal combination produces a tough, long-wearing material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina on the surface of bells which coats it against further oxidation.Specifically, it is the combination of low <b>internal</b> <b>damping</b> and low internal sound velocity that makes bell metal specially suitable for resonant percussion instruments.|$|E

40|$|The {{landing of}} the ROSETTA-mission lander Philae on November 12 th 2014 on Comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was planned as a descent with passive landing and {{anchoring}} by harpoons at touch-down. Actually the lander was not fixed at touch-down {{to the ground}} due to failing harpoons. The lander <b>internal</b> <b>damper</b> was actuated at touch-down for 42. 6 mm with a speed of 0. 08 m/s while the lander touch-down speed was 1 m/s. The kinetic energy before touch-down was 50 J, 45 J were dissipated by the lander <b>internal</b> <b>damper</b> and by ground penetration at touch-down, and 5 J kinetic energy are left after touch-down (0. 325 m/s speed). Most kinetic energy was dissipated by ground penetration (41 J) while only 4 J are dissipated by the lander <b>internal</b> <b>damper.</b> Based on these data, a value for a constant compressive soil-strength of less than 1. 7 kPa is calculated. This paper focuses on {{the reconstruction of the}} touch-down at Agilkia over a period of around 20 s from first ground contact to lift-off again. After rebound Philae left a strange pattern on ground documented by the OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera (NAC). The analysis shows, that the touch-down was not just a simple damped reflection on the surface. Instead the lander had repeated contacts with the surface over a period of about 20 s +/- 10 s. This paper discusses scenarios for the reconstruction of the landing sequence based on the data available and on computer simulations. Simulations are performed with a dedicated mechanical multi-body model of the lander, which was validated previously in numerous ground tests. The SIMPACK simulation software was used, including the option to set forces at the feet to the ground. The outgoing velocity vector is mostly influenced by the timing of the ground contact of the different feet. It turns out that ground friction during damping has strong impact on the lander outgoing velocity, on its rotation, and on its nutation. After the end of damping, the attitude of the lander can be strongly changed by the additional ground contacts even with the flywheel still running inside the lander. The simulation shows that the outbound velocity vector and the lander rotation were formed immediately at touch-down during the first 1. 5 s. The outbound velocity vector is found to be formed by the ground slope and the lander damping characteristic, especially the nearly horizontal flight out...|$|R

2500|$|The Type A1 cabinet, {{formerly}} known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75ft/min. The downflow air, considered contaminated, splits just above the work surface (the BSCs smoke split) and mixes with the inflow. This air is drawn, through ductwork, {{up the back of}} the cabinet where it is then blown into a positive pressure, contaminated plenum. Here, the air is either recirculated, through a HEPA filter, back down over the work zone, or exhausted out of the cabinet (also through a HEPA filter).

50|$|This {{unsprung}} weight is cushioned from uneven road surfaces {{only by the}} compressive resilience of the tire (and wire wheels if fitted), which aids the wheel in remaining {{in contact with the}} road surface when the wheel inertia prevents close-following of the ground surface. However, the compressive resilience of the tire results in rolling resistance which requires additional kinetic energy to overcome, and the rolling resistance is expended in the tire as heat due to the flexing of the rubber and steel bands in the sidewalls of the tires. To reduce rolling resistance for improved fuel economy and to avoid overheating and failure of tires at high speed, tires are designed to have limited <b>internal</b> <b>damping.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{follows that}} initially, only W and Δ {{should be taken}} into account for the {{morphological}} design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its <b>internal</b> <b>damping</b> is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to dynamic stress. The volume V of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force F which is applied to it, to its length L and to the morphological factor W; it is inversely proportional to the stress σ to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ρ of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement δ remains proportional to the span L and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its working stress σ and the modulus of elasticity E.|$|E

The industry unique dampening technique manages energy dissipation in a desired, controlled manner within the enclosure while keeping the cabinet musically alive. Perhaps what might put all this into the best perspective of Totem’s uncompromising construction is time. While some competitive companies like to brag about how many they can build in an hour, even a compact model like the Model 1 Signature, takes nine hours of labor to build. It’s also important to note that we’re talking about a product built in North America where the cost of labor is exponentially higher than anywhere in Asia, and yet our product still punches well above its weight and is always considered to offer competitively incredible value and performance.|$|E

The system is described by four independent parameters and exhibits a variety of behaviors including rigid motion, super stability/instability and zero damping. The solution is obtained by applying the Laplace transform to the equation of motion and computing the Green's function of the transformed problem. This leads to an unconventional eigenvalue-like problem with the spectral variable in the boundary conditions. The eigenmodes of the problem are necessarily complex-valued and are not orthogonal in the usual inner product. Nonetheless, in generic cases we obtain an explicit eigenmode expansion for {{the response of the}} bar to initial conditions and external force. For some special values of parameters the system of eigenmodes may become incomplete, or no non-trivial eigenmodes may exist at all. We thoroughly analyze physical and mathematical reasons for this behavior and explicitly identify the corresponding parameter values.
