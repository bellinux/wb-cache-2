5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take {{up to two years}} to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E
5|$|England batted {{first to}} score 362, {{but when the}} West Indies batted, Ganteaume and his opening partner, George Carew shared a {{partnership}} of 173. Once more, Ganteaume was criticised for slow batting, although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in-form partner to face the bowling. On the third day, he carried on batting to reach his century, {{the first in a}} Test match by a Trinidadian in Trinidad. The innings took around 270 minutes, but <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> down as he neared three-figures, and the West Indies' captain sent out a note asking the batsmen to score faster. Other batsmen also batted slowly, and Ganteaume later claimed that England used negative, run-saving tactics to slow the scoring rate. He did not bat in the second innings, when the West Indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win the game. The match was drawn, having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut the playing time, but in the knowledge that quick scoring was vital, Ganteaume's slow batting adversely affected the West Indies' chances of victory.|$|E

5|$|Herta retired on lap 55 when <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> on the frontstrech {{after his}} car {{developed}} {{a voltage regulator}} problem which caused his engine to cut out. Da Matta moved back into first place on the next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place. Da Matta fell to fourth after he was passed by Vasser around the outside of turn one and Castroneves moved into second five laps later. Papis retook the first position on lap 86. Castroneves pulled off the track at turn four and stopped at the pit road exit to retire with an engine failure on the following lap. Mears moved into the lead on lap 87, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Da Matta and Papis traded the first position over laps 91 to 98. Tagliani took over the lead on the 99th lap.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> and later pulled {{to the side of}} the track with fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on track with an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted to get past Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 All-Africa Games {{represented}} a double landmark victory for Zersenay: {{he became the}} first Eritrean medallist in the competition's history, and won his first ever gold medal on the track, sealing victory in the 10,000 m final with a Games record time of 27:00.30. The following month he competed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, and he edged closer to a podium finish – he led the 10,000 m race up to the 8km mark, setting a fast pace, but ultimately ended up in fourth position. Preparing for the road championships that year, he ran the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race in September and won in 45:51 (the world's fastest that season), finishing some distance ahead of runners up Bernard Kipyego and James Rotich. Zersenay emphasised his position as one of the world's most dominant half marathon runners with a second victory at the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. Although he was close to world record pace at the 15km point, <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> behind the leading pack of Makau Musyoki, Evans Kiprop Cheruiyot and Deriba Merga. In the final kilometre, he burst away to take the lead and the gold medal, setting a national and championship record time of 58:59 in the process. Following these achievements, a medical team did a study of his running economy and found him {{to be one of the}} most efficient runners ever to be tested.|$|E

25|$|Pironi was 15 laps {{from the}} end, {{when he noticed}} a front wheel wobble on his Ligier. <b>He</b> <b>slowed</b> the car to approx 50km/h (30mph) before the wheel came off, and he pulled off the track {{at the end of}} the start/finish {{straight}} to retire, giving Jones the lead. Jones continued to keep a fairly constant distance between himself and second placed Jochen Mass to win the race, with Elio de Angelis, the only other car to be on the lead lap, finishing third. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi finished in fourth and fifth place respectively, both one lap down. Sixth placed Patrick Gaillard was the last driver to be classified as finishing the race, five laps down after his earlier collision with John Watson's car.|$|E

25|$|Jordan wrote {{full-time}} at breakneck {{speed for}} the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, A Crown of Swords, at which point <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called New Spring, so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters {{at the expense of the}} main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, Crossroads of Twilight (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, Winter's Heart, from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned. Knife of Dreams, the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title A Memory of Light, would conclude the series.|$|E
25|$|Asafa {{opened his}} 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200m {{where he came}} in third after {{what looked to be}} a good first 140m, slowing down {{significantly}} at {{the last quarter of the}} race. His time was 20.55s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4x100m relay USA vs The World at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted off like a bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.|$|E
25|$|Asafa Powell {{opened his}} 2010 season on 20 February at the UWI Invitational Meet in Jamaica, by {{competing}} in the 400m. He won his heat {{in a time of}} 47.56s, but he was placed 3rd overall according to his time. He then ran the 200m at the UTech Classic on 17 April 2010, also in his homeland. He competed in the 200m in heavy rain and cold conditions. Powell opened up a huge lead in the first 100m after which <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> drastically and won his heat in 21.27s in a 1m/s headwind. Later it was reported that Powell had suffered minor cramps on his left calf muscles, which was why he had to slow down. Powell was next scheduled to run in the highly anticipated 4x100m Penn Relays featuring Jamaica Yellow, and competing against Usain Bolt (Jamaica Black). But he pulled out of the race as it was reported by his assistant coach that he had an injured toe which would need some time to heal. At the IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Powell made a wind aided time of 9.75s in the heat and 9.81s in the final,also wind-aided. He subsequently set a 100m world leading time of 9.83s. En route to this performance, he also set the rarely run 100 yards dash world best at 9.07 s, beating the previous record of 9.21 set by Charlie Greene.|$|E

25|$|An {{improvement}} in form {{came at the}} Italian Grand Prix where the cars ran without wings and Goodyear brought their new G9 specification tyre. McLaren qualified on the front row and led to begin with until <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> {{at the scene of}} an accident and was caught by Stewart, Hulme and Jo Siffert in a Lotus. A slipstreaming battle ensued; McLaren retired with an oil leak at mid-distance but Hulme went on to win. From the Canadian Grand Prix onwards, a third M7A was driven by Dan Gurney whose Anglo American Racers team – for whom Bruce McLaren had driven for three races in 1967 – had run out of funding for their own Eagle cars. Gurney retired with overheating in Canada, but Hulme and McLaren continued their success by finishing first and second respectively, albeit after their strongest challengers had all retired. Hulme was then jointly in the lead of the drivers' championship with two races to go. He ran competitively towards the beginning of the United States Grand Prix but ultimately retired via a spin, pit stops to repair damaged brake lines and a gearbox output shaft failure which spun him again, this time into a crash. McLaren was sixth, Gurney fourth. Going into the final race in Mexico, Hulme retained a chance of defending his title. McLaren finished second there, but Hulme crashed out because of a broken suspension damper allowing Hill to win the drivers' championship.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Hooper read a book {{entitled}} How to Make Film and Television and {{decided he wanted to}} become a director. For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts. Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled Runaway Dog, using a clockwork 16mm Bolex camera his uncle had given to him. Hooper said: [...] "The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds, so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds. I could only afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome reversal film, which cost about twenty-five , and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed. I could only make silent movies, because sound was too expensive and complicated." [...] <b>He</b> <b>slowed</b> down the frame rate of the camera so he could maximise what little film stock he had. Hooper classified the short, about a dog which kept running away from its owner, as a comedy, and filmed it on location in Oxfordshire.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his third}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. While he had written complete annual cycles for many occasions of the liturgical year {{the first two years}} in the position, <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> down in the third. For the Reformation Day, he composed this new cantata, his first extant work for the occasion. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, [...] "be steadfast against adversaries" [...] (...) , and from the Book of Revelation, fear God and honour him (...) [...] The writer of the text – an unknown poet – was not concerned about the readings, and began with a quotation from Psalm 84 (...) [...] He included the first stanza from Martin Rinckart's hymn [...] "" [...] and as the closing chorale the final stanza of Ludwig Helmbold's hymn [...] "". According to the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann, the first of these hymns was sung regularly after the sermon on Reformation Day in Leipzig.|$|E
500|$|Otter and Staunch both fell rapidly behind Boadicea, while Africaine pulled far ahead. By 18:20, lookouts on Africaine {{could no}} longer see the other British ships, and by 18:30, Boadicea was {{similarly}} alone. Bouvet realised the lack of cohesion in the British squadron, and also recognised that Africaine was faster than either of his ships and would soon catch them. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>slowed</b> and prepared to meet the British frigate as night fell. Corbet now found himself outnumbered and began to launch rockets and flares in the hope of attracting Rowley's attention and as the French closed with Africaine, he readied his ship for action. [...] behind, Rowley could see the flares and flashes but was powerless to intercede in the darkness. At 01:50 on 13 September, the gap had closed between Africaine and the French ships, and at 02:20 Corbet opened fire on Astrée, with Bouvet returning the fire immediately.|$|E
