500|$|... 1997 {{also saw}} lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, {{prompting}} {{speculation about the}} band's survival; McCrea noted that [...] "Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that it (their departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world", {{and said that he}} had considered dissolving the band. Brown and Damiani formed the [...] "new-wave influenced" [...] Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.|$|E
500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race [...] "today <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> I could have done something more". Cyclingnews.com suggested after the race that he had the potential to win a Monument in the future.|$|E

5000|$|She said, [...] "I {{thought it}} would be like a summer holiday job ...then one film led to another and {{suddenly}} I was an actor and <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> had made the decision ... I felt at home in the language of acting."" [...] Her breakthrough role was in the 1986 Danish film directed by Astrid Henning-Jensen, Early Spring.|$|R
500|$|Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> at {{that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{was highly}} {{acclaimed}} by critics upon release. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine recognized the song to be Swift's best {{and added that}} once the lyrics are learned, {{it is impossible to}} not sing along. Sean Dooley of About.com credited the song for transitioning Swift from a [...] "fresh-faced star to crossover superstar". Dooley attributed the song's commercial success due to her departure from her past lyrical themes, which summarized [...] "I wish this boy knew how <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> about him”. While reviewing Fearless, Dooley selected [...] "Love Story" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks on the album. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine admired how Swift attempted to incorporate sophisticated elements, like Romeo and Juliet and The Scarlet Letter, although it was not successful because of its awkwardness, inexplicable nature, and pointless conceit. Keefe credited its success to its prominent hook. James Reed of The Boston Globe thought otherwise, stating Swift's charm was in her songwriting skills.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E

500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. So, <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|R
60|$|While {{the aspect}} under which Sir Percival {{presented}} himself to-night was unhappily but too familiar to me, the aspect {{under which the}} Count appeared was, on the other hand, entirely new in my experience of him.

500|$|In 1954, Thatcher was {{defeated}} when she sought selection {{to be the}} Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: [...] "I really just felt the twins were... only two, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> {{that it was too}} soon. I couldn't do that." [...] Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill (the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required somebody who had {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied who I am as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control (1986), Jackson was motivated {{to take a}} larger role in her album's creative process. According to Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits (2002), A Records requested she record an album similar to Control. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal, which would have centered around her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a [...] "Control II." [...] Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control, stating [...] "that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something that I really believed in and that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> strong about." [...] She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album's theme to social consciousness, but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept. Jam stated that her inspiration for the album's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "State of the World".|$|E
500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E
500|$|Mauboy grew up {{listening}} to country singers Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Slim Dusty; she credits country music as her first love of music, saying the genre [...] "is who I really, really am deeply." [...] Mauboy also grew up {{listening to}} hip-hop rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Mauboy cites Mariah Carey as her main influence and inspiration, stating that she has [...] "drawn a lot of inspiration from watching and listening to her live performances". She grew {{up listening to}} many of Carey's songs and was inspired by her vocal style and songwriting, [...] "I loved 'Dreamlover' and 'Fantasy' – and picked up loads of tips from her style of singing. She taught me that the lyrics you write have to come from personal experiences – <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> her music. Now I aspire to writing honest lyrics with real feelings that people can relate to." [...] Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that she looks up to her and Carey [...] "for their outstanding vocal performances". Her other musical influences are John Farnham and Beyoncé. Mauboy is also inspired by fellow Indigenous Australian women such as Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman and actress Deborah Mailman.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] that I really believed in and that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E

Christopher would pay tribute to his father's contribution to the war: [...] "Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done."

500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time.

2500|$|After {{seeing them}} at SXSW, Robin Hilton of NPR's All Songs Considered {{described}} their sound as [...] "gloriously loud fuzzy rock." [...] All Songs Considered featured the band's song “Yeah, I’m Okay With My Shit Life.” Hilton went on saying that there's been lot of comparisons between Generation X and the Millennials over the years, they’re exactly the same, nothing’s changed. He expanded, [...] "The complaint about Gen Xer's were they’re lazy and don’t care. They’re the whatever generation. And I felt like when I {{was watching a}} lot of the younger bands at South by this year <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> like that vibe is coming back. The whatever rock, and I loved it." [...] Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton coined the genre name of 'Whatever Rock'/Shrug Rock, naming Bethlehem Steel as their source.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant {{sold the}} Copping farm for $143,000 {{and kept the}} Hobart mansion. While living at Copping, the white {{overalls}} he habitually wore were replaced with clothing {{more in line with}} Harvey's financial status. Now that he was alone, his dress became more bizarre. He often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling anyone who would listen that he had a well-paying career. He often wore an electric blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: [...] "It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> suddenly quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn't really have any friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

The howl and roar, the rattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning. But there was now a great darkness besides; and that invested the storm with new terrors, real and fanciful.|$|R
