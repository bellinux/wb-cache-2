50|$|Pakistan has blocked {{negotiation}} of a <b>Fissile</b> <b>Material</b> Cutoff Treaty as {{it continues to}} produce <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> for weapons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fissile</b> <b>Material</b> Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) is a {{proposed}} international treaty to prohibit the further production of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{for nuclear weapons}} or other explosive devices. The treaty has not been negotiated and its terms remain to be defined. According to a proposal by the United States, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> includes high-enriched uranium and plutonium (except plutonium that is over 80% Pu-238). According to a proposal by Russia, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{would be limited to}} weapons-grade uranium (with more than 90% U-235) and plutonium (with more than 90% Pu-239). Neither proposal would prohibit the production of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> for non-weapons purposes, including use in civil or naval nuclear reactors.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear engineering, <b>fissile</b> <b>{{material}}</b> is material {{capable of}} sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction. By definition, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> can sustain {{a chain reaction}} with neutrons of any energy. The predominant neutron energy may be typified by either slow neutrons (i.e., a thermal system) or fast neutrons. <b>Fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{can be used to}} fuel thermal-neutron reactors, fast-neutron reactors and nuclear explosives.|$|R
50|$|Proposed {{applications}} for fertile material includes a space-based facility for {{the manufacture of}} <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> for spacecraft nuclear propulsion. The facility would notionally transport fertile materials from Earth, safely through the atmosphere, and locate them at a space facility at the Earth-Moon L1 Lagrangian point where manufacture of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> would occur, eliminating the safety risk of transport of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> from Earth.|$|R
40|$|At this time, the Office of <b>Fissile</b> <b>Materials</b> Disposition {{within the}} DOE, is {{assessing}} alternatives for {{the disposition of}} excess <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b> To facilitate the assessment, the Plutonium-Bearing Materials Feed Report for the DOE <b>Fissile</b> <b>Materials</b> Disposition Program Alternatives report was written. The development of the material categories and the derivation of the inventory quantities associated with those categories is documented in this report...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} terrorist threats and illegal proliferation of nuclear material and technology, {{there is a}} need for increased research in the area of detection of smuggled <b>fissile</b> <b>material,</b> some of which is designated by the International Atomic Energy Agency as special <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> This thesis focuses on a hypothetical scenario in which a terrorist organization has managed to smuggle an amount of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> onto a personal recreational watercraft and sail it into a marina. If the boat could be forced to go through a detector system, then the contents could be interrogated and a determination made of whether any special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> was aboard. This thesis examines the hypothesis that active interrogation may be used successfully in the detection of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in such an environment. It shows that it is feasible to use an active neutron system to detect a significant quantity of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> onboard a small boat via the differential dieaway technique. The MCNP Monte Carlo transport code was used to simulate the use of a pulsed neutron generator to induce fission in the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> and then estimate the detector response. The detector modeled was based on elastic scattering-induced recoil protons using pure hydrogen gas. There was a significant difference between the system with and without the presence of <b>fissile</b> <b>material,</b> and the estimated detector response for the system with <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> present was shown to be sufficiently greater than the response due to background radiation only. Additionally, dose was estimated and found to be small enough that the system would not likely pose a significant radiological health risk to passengers on the boat...|$|R
50|$|Geometry/shape of the fissile material: If {{neutrons}} escape (leak from) the fissile {{system they}} are not available to cause fission events in the <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, {{the shape of the}} <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> affects the probability of occurrence of fission events. A shape with a large surface area, such as a thin slab, favors leakage and is safer than the same amount of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in a small, compact shape such as a cube or sphere.|$|R
25|$|As the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{growth rate}} {{does not meet}} this objective, it becomes {{necessary}} to look at alternative approaches for obtaining the <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> This conclusion is mostly independent of future technical breakthroughs, and complementary to the eventual implementation of the three-stage approach. It was realised {{that the best way}} to get access to the requisite <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> would be through uranium imports, which was not possible without ending India’s nuclear isolation by U.S. and the NSG.|$|R
50|$|For a given mass of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{the value}} of k can be {{increased}} by increasing the density. Since the probability per distance traveled for a neutron to collide with a nucleus {{is proportional to the}} material density, increasing the density of a <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> can increase k. This concept is utilized in the implosion method for nuclear weapons. In these devices, the nuclear chain reaction begins after increasing the density of the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> with a conventional explosive.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the need}} for a fission primary, and the {{difficulty}} of purifying weapons-grade <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> the majority of arms control efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> and the equipment needed to obtain it.|$|R
40|$|Pressures are {{mounting}} for {{a regime}} {{to verify the}} dismantlement of US and Russian warheads, {{as well as a}} system of international control over the weapons' <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> to assure irreversibility. There are at least four motivating factors for these measures: • As the United States and Russia lower their numbers of nuclear weapons, each side seeks assurance that the warheads are actually being dismantled. • By accounting for the <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> and placing them under effective controls, the potential for smuggling and theft is reduced. • A <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> cutoff is being discussed at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Verification of a US-Russian cutoff, as well as substantial reductions in <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> stockpiles, are seen as integral to the cutoff. • Calls for total nuclear disarmament have greatly increased. Dismantlement verification and international control of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> are widely viewed as requisite steps toward this goal. There are many questions to be answered before the United States can agree to a warhead verification regime and international control over excess <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> let alone total nuclear disarmament. Two of the most important are: What are the prospects for effective verification? and How much <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> can be declared as excess, and possibly be, given over to international control? These topics - compliance weaknesses and excess materials - are the focus of this paper. Naval Postgraduate SchoolUnited States Strategic CommandU. S. Department of EnergyContract no.

25|$|Low fissile inventory. Because the fissile fuel is {{concentrated}} in a small core fluid, the actual reactor core is more compact. There is no <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in the outer blanket that contains the fertile fuel for breeding. Because of this, the 1968 ORNL design required just 315 kilograms of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> to start up a 250 MW(e) two fluid MSBR reactor. This reduces {{the cost of the}} initial fissile startup charge, and allows more reactors to be started up on any given amount of <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R

5000|$|According to Moir and Teller, [...] "once {{started up}} it needs no other fuel except thorium {{because it makes}} {{most or all of}} its own fuel."
