500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what it was like}} to be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how it feels to be an ornament. I had nothing to do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E

500|$|Assata Shakur {{was born}} Joanne Deborah Byron, in Flushing, Queens, New York City, on July 16, 1947. She lived {{for three years}} with her mother, school teacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill. In 1950, Shakur's parents {{divorced}} and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. Shakur moved back to Queens {{with her mother and}} stepfather after elementary school, attending Parsons Junior High School. However, she still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. The family struggled financially, and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker, who lived in Manhattan. She has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was [...] "very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i [...] was forever asking all kinds of questions. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> everything." [...] Williams often took her to museums, theaters, and art galleries, and the conflicts that did rise between the two were typically due to Shakur's habit of lying.|$|E
