It attempts to explore (1) what the general learning trategy profile {{is in terms of}} six strategy categories, namely, the memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective, and ocial strategies; (2) how gender, age, educational background and rea of knowledge influence use of learning strategies; and (3) whether there are any interactions among those learner factors in use flearning strategies. A total of 154 respondents who were course akers at P 3 B UNY were invited to complete a set of questionnaires bout use of learning strategies. To analyze the obtained data, escriptive statistics were administered to describe the general earning strategy profile; univariate statistical analyses were mployed to showthe influence ofthe individual factorson strategy se, and multivariate analyses were also applied to examine the nteractions among the learner factors. Based on the analyses, some indings were obtained as follows. First, in general, respondents eported use of the six strategy categories above themean line of the nstrument scale. Quantitatively, themetacognitive strategywas the most frequently used <b>strategy</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 3, 4430), followed onsecutively by the affective <b>strategy</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 3, 3026), the ompensation <b>strategy</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 3, 3019), the memory <b>strategy</b> <b>Mean</b> = 3, 0426), the cognitive <b>strategy</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 2, 9859), and the ocial <b>strategy</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 2, 8571).

40|$|Abstract—Studies {{investigating}} chair rise (CR) {{strategies in}} older adults, including {{the identification of}} CR strategies in the clinical setting, are limited. We identified biomechanical dif-ferences between CR strategies performed by older adults. The “healthy ” momentum transfer (MT), the exaggerated trunk flexion (ETF), and the dominant vertical rise (DVR) CR strate-gies were observed in 29 women and 17 men (64 – 88 yr) with functional limitations. The DVR strategy required the greatest knee torque (mean = 12. 76 moment– % body weight). Maxi-mum knee torque occurred significantly earlier for the ETF <b>strategy</b> (<b>mean</b> = 47 % CR time). Lift-off time was earliest for the ETF <b>strategy</b> (<b>mean</b> = 32 % CR time). Peak trunk flexion was the primary distinguishing biomechanical measure for classifying CR strategy.
