This ten fold increase in rate is due to climate change and is dominated by melting of land ice and warming of ocean water.

In this article, we review recent advances in our understanding of past sea-level changes on decadal to millennial timescales to consider how well future changes can be constrained. The majority of studies suggest that global mean sea-level rise will most likely be less than 1 m over the 21 st century. Importantly, there will be significant departures from the global mean by several <b>decimetres</b> in many areas.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} effects of wave patterns on 3 D point coordinate accuracy in LiDAR bathymetry. The finite diameter refracted laser pulse path passing the air/water interface is modelled differentially and in a strict manner. Typical wave patterns are simulated {{and their impact on}} the 3 D coordinates {{at the bottom of the}} water body are analysed. It can be shown that {{the effects of}} waves within small LiDAR bathymetry footprints on the depth and planimetry coordinates is significant. Planimetric effects may reach several <b>decimetres</b> or even metres, and depth coordinate errors also reach several <b>decimetres,</b> even in case of horizontal water body bottom. The simplified assumption of averaging wave effects often made in many ALB applications is not only fulfilled in cases of a very large beam divergence under certain wave pattern conditions. Modern smaller beam divergence systems will mostly experience significant wave pattern dependent coordinate errors. The results presented here thus form a basis for a more strict coordinate correction if the wave pattern can be modelled from the LiDAR bathymetry water surface reflections or other observations. Moreover, it will be shown that the induced coordinate errors contain systematic parts in addition to the local wave surface dependent quasi-random part, which allows for the formulation of wave pattern type dependent correction terms...|$|R
