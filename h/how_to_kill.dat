5|$|Cú Roí, {{again in}} disguise, joins the Ulstermen on {{a raid on}} Inis Fer Falga (probably the Isle of Man), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct Blathnát, {{daughter}} of the island's king, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathnát. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathnát with him. Like other heroes such as the Biblical Samson, Duryodhana in the Mahabharata and the Welsh Llew Llaw Gyffes, Cú Roí can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in {{different versions of the}} story. Blathnat discovers <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him and betrays him to Cú Chulainn, who does the deed.

Bilbo tricks Smaug (James Horan) into showing him his stomach, which is coated in diamonds, except for one small spot, where his skin is exposed.

It's less a video game and more a weapon of personal destruction. This is about stacking bodies.

500|$|Thompson has {{rejected}} arguments that such video games {{are protected by}} freedom of expression, saying, [...] "Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech.

In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, {{saying that it was}} looking [...] "for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller [...] "gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill.

500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E
