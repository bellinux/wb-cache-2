5000|$|In addition, Gestalt {{theory can}} be used to explain the illusory {{contours}} in the <b>Kanizsa's</b> <b>Triangle.</b> A floating white triangle, which does not exist, is seen. The brain has a need to see familiar simple objects and has a tendency to create a [...] "whole" [...] image from individual elements. Gestalt means [...] "form" [...] or [...] "shape" [...] in German. However, another explanation of the <b>Kanizsa's</b> <b>Triangle</b> is based in evolutionary psychology and the fact that in order to survive it was important to see form and edges. The use of perceptual organization to create meaning out of stimuli is the principle behind other well-known illusions including impossible objects. Our brain makes sense of shapes and symbols putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle, formulating that which isn't there to that which is believable.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} visual search for illusory figures have {{provided}} equivocal results, with efficient search for Kanizsa squares (eg Davis and Driver, 1994 Nature 371 291 - 293) contrasting with inefficient search for <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangles</b> (eg Grabowecky and Treisman, 1989 Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science 30 457). Here, we investigated whether shape orientation can explain these differences. The results from three experiments replicated previous findings: Kanizsa squares in experiment 1 could be detected {{more efficiently than}} <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangles</b> in experiment 2. In addition, when controlling for stimulus complexity in experiment 3, we found search for Kanizsa diamonds intermediate in efficiency. Taken together, these results suggest an oblique effect in search for Kanizsa figures with cardinal shape orientations leading to more efficient performance than oblique shape orientations. Our findings indicate that both shape orientation and stimulus complexity affect search for illusory figures...|$|R

5000|$|Visual illusions proper {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from some related phenomena. Some simple targets such as the Necker Cube are capable {{of more than one}} interpretation, which are usually seen in alternation, one at a time. They may be called ambiguous configurations rather than illusion, because what is seen at any time is not actually illusory. The configurations of the Penrose or Escher type are illusory in the sense that only on a detailed logical analysis it becomes apparent that they are not physically realizable. If one thinks of an illusion as something out there that is misinterpreted, and of a delusion when a demonstrable substrate is lacking, the distinction breaks down for such effects as the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> and illusory contours.|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} exists showing V 1 /V 2 cortical activity {{in response to}} illusory contours (e. g. <b>Kanizsa's</b> <b>triangle)</b> [1]. V 1 represents information that correlates with visual perception but does not arise from the ordinary feedforward pathways (retina and LGN), suggesting this response is driven by feedback connections from higherlevel areas. At the same time, several authors have emphasized the important role played by feedback connections in visual perception and have suggested hierarchical Bayesian inference as a plausible underlying interpretation [2 - 5]. The proposed model aims at providing a functional interpretation of the illusory contour phenomenon and, more generally, {{of the role of}} feedback connections in visual perception under the perspective of a Bayesian inference framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{cortical}} {{representation of}} {{figure and ground}} {{still seems to be}} a partly solved puzzle. Based on psychophysically mapped contrast sensitivity fields within closed boundaries, it has been suggested earlier that symmetry related surface representations might be relevant in addition to co-linear activation along the path of a contour (Kovacs and Julesz, 1994). Here we test the classic illusory figures (<b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangles)</b> with a test probe that appears near the illusory edge. The task is to decide whether the probe appears inside or outside of the illusory triangle. Assuming an equilateral triangle, and that the illusory edge spans a straight path between the inducers, our results are surprisingly asymmetrical for inside and outside test probes. While there is no difficulty to judge outside targets, probes appearing on the alleged contour, or inside the assumed triangle are very clearly judged to be outside for up to a distance that is about 3 % of the illusory contour length. The bent illusory contours seem to be more curved for diagonal than for horizontal or vertical edges. We interpret these results as a new indication for the necessity to couple medialness structure (Aparajeya and Fol Leymarie, 2016) with lateral propagation of contour completion...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} evoked and induced {{responses in}} event-related fields and gamma {{activity in the}} magnetoencephalogram (MEG) during a visual classification task. The objective {{was to investigate the}} effects of target classification and the different levels of discrimination between certain stimulus features. We performed two experiments, which differed only in the subjects’ task while the stimuli were identical. In Experiment 1, subjects responded by a button-press to rare Kanizsa squares (targets) among <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangles</b> and non-Kanizsa figures (standards). This task requires the processing of both stimulus features (collinearity and number of inducer disks). In Experiment 2, the four stimuli of Experiment 1 were used as standards and the occurrence of an additional stimulus without any feature overlap with the Kanizsa stimuli (a rare and highly salient red fixation cross) had to be detected. Discrimination of collinearity and number of inducer disks was not necessarily required for task performance. We applied a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis to the data and calculated topographical maps of the 40 Hz activity. The early evoked gamma activity (100 – 200 ms) in Experiment 1 was higher for targets as compared to standards. In Experiment 2, {{no significant differences were found}} in the gamma responses to the Kanizsa figures and non-Kanizsa figures. This pattern of results suggests that early evoked gamma activity in response to visual stimuli is affected by the targetness of a stimulus and the need to discriminate between the features of a stimulus...|$|R
50|$|Gregory progressed {{this idea}} {{with a key}} analogy. The process whereby the brain puts {{together}} a coherent view {{of the outside world}} is analogous {{to the way in which}} the sciences build up their picture of the world, by a kind of hypothetico-deductive process. Although this takes place on a quite different time-scale, and inside one head instead of a community, nevertheless, according to Gregory, perception shares many traits with scientific method. A series of works by Gregory developed this idea in some detail.Gregory's ideas ran counter to those of the American direct realist psychologist J.J. Gibson, whose 1950 The Perception of the Visual World was dominant when Gregory was a younger man. Much in Gregory's work can be seen as a reply to Gibson's ideas, and as the incorporation of explicitly Bayesian concepts into the understanding of how sensory evidence is combined with pre-existing ("prior") beliefs. Gregory argued that optical illusions, such as the illusory contours in the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle,</b> demonstrated the Bayesian processing of perceptual information by the brain.|$|E
40|$|Much {{information}} could be processed unconsciously. However, {{there is no}} direct evidence on whether perceptual grouping could occur without awareness. To answer this question, we investigated whether a <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> (an example of perceptual grouping) is processed differently from stimuli with the same local components but are ungrouped or weakly grouped. Specifically, using a suppression time paradigm we tested whether a <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> would emerge from interocular continuous flash suppression sooner than control stimuli. Results show a significant advantage of the Kanizsa triangle: the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> emerged from suppression noise significantly faster than the control stimulus with the local Pacmen randomly rotated (t(9)  = - 2. 78, p =  0. 02); and also faster than the control stimulus with all Pacmen rotated 180 ° (t(11)  = - 3. 20, p< 0. 01). Additional results demonstrated that the advantage of the grouped <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> could not be accounted for by the faster detection speed at the conscious level for the Kanizsa figures on a dynamic noise background. Our results indicate that certain properties supporting perceptual grouping could be processed in the absence of awareness...|$|E
40|$|Illusory {{contours}} are intrinsic {{phenomena in}} human vision. Many {{methods have been}} proposed to identify illusory contours. In this paper, we present a level set based variational model to capture a typical class of illusory contours such as <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle.</b> The model consists of two parts: the first part drives the zero level set to the inside desired solid boundaries and keeps it sticking to the L-junctions while the second one employs the Euler's Elastica to complete the missing boundaries in a curvature continuity and short length way which {{has been shown to}} conform with human perception. The illusory contour is just the limit zero level curve. The listed experiments, including classical ones such as <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> and square, validate our model...|$|E
40|$|It {{is a part}} of {{the common}} belief in many cultures, as the European culture, that human beings make {{mistakes}} and errors when they think and reason. However, when people talk about cognitive illusions barely they are thinking to memory functions (for an extensive review see: Pohl, 2010). The reason is that the better-known domain of the cognitive illusions are the optical illusions. The main characteristic of whatever kind of illusion is the involuntariness, i. e. they occur without a deliberate will and are hard to avoid. However, they are all different for the cognitive function involved (perception, memory, thinking, judgment and decision-making). Let us consider some famous perceptual illusions discovered by the pioneer authors of the Gestalt psychology. In Figure 1 are reported three famous visual illusions. The first is the Ponzo’s illusion (1911), which consists in seeing the lower horizontal line as shorter than the higher line. Actually, the two line are equal. The second illusion consists in perceiving a brightness changing in the horizontal bar due to the background gradient (Kanizsa, 1955). Actually, the horizontal bar is monochromatic. The third illusion consists in perceiving a triangle with a more intense white than the background white (Tanca, Grossberg, & Pinna, 2010). In the case of the optical illusions, the discrepancy between reality and illusion created is immediately evident and costs low effort, because the subjective perception can be immediately compared with the external stimulus. The reader can control the illusions measuring the length of the two bars in the Ponzo’s illusion, isolating the central grey bar from the background in the simultaneous contrast illusion, and simply shifting the attention focus from the <b>Kanizsa’s</b> <b>triangle</b> to one side of it. This is not always possible when we refers to memory, judgments and decision-making. In the former case, we could check whether we remembered something right just when the external source is still available or captured in some modern storage technology (a book, a movie, a picture, a data-file, etc.). When this is not possible, the memory illusion could be considered a specific case of judgment illusion. When we have a doubt on what we have recollected from our memory, we decide to trust or not of our memory basing that decision on our confidence (i. e., memory judgment). When we talk about pure judgment and illusion in decision domain, instead, we need a normative theory that tells us how to decide rationally, in order to define where we make a mistake (Gigerenzer, 1996; Rumiati & Bonini, 2001). Nevertheless, it is crucial to do not confuse the cognitive illusion from simple errors, misunderstandings or ordinary forms of forgetting. Generally, to distinguish cognitive illusions from simple distortions we need to observe robustness in replicating that illusion (Roediger, 1996). This is way cognitive illusions attract our attention and makes meaningful for the researcher to explain the unexpected finding as a cognitive illusion. The main aim of this dissertation is to describe the psychological processes involved in the production of false memories as measured by the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). It is a particular case of the associative memory illusion (Roediger, 1996) consisting in remembering words not presented in a previous study phase. This paradigm has been widely used in the laboratory settings to study the memory process that cause false memories (for a review see: Gallo, 2010). The present dissertation consist in three main sections. An introductory section in which I reported the theoretical background and the questions that I tried to answer during my PhD. In the first section, I included also a paragraph on methodology used and in which I explain the methodological background of few statistical tools that I adopted. In the middle section, I reported all the experiments with the respective sub-section relative to introduction, method, results and discussion.

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} fish to {{perceive}} subjective (or illusory) contours, ie contours that lack a physical Counterpart {{in terms of}} luminance contrast gradients, was investigated. In the first experiment, redtail splitfins (Xenotoca eiseni), family Goodeidae, were trained to discriminate between a geometric figure (a triangle or a square) oil various backgrounds and a background without any Figure. Thereafter, the fish performed test trials in which illusory squares or triangles were obtained by (i) interruptions of a background of diagonal lines, (ii) phase-shifting of a background of diagonal lines, and (iii) pacmen spatially arranged to induce perception of Kanizsa subjective surfaces. In all three conditions, fish seemed to generalise their responses to Stimuli perceived as subjective contours by humans. Fish chose, correctly, squares or triangles made of interrupted or phase-shifted diagonal lines from uniform backgrounds of diagonal lines, as well as illusory square or <b>triangle</b> <b>Kanizsa</b> figures from figures in which the inducing pacmen were scrambled. In the second experiment, fish were trained to discriminate between a vertical and a horizontal bar with luminance contrast gradients, and then tested with vertically and horizontally oriented illusory bars, created either through interruption or spatial phase-shift of inducing diagonal lines. Fish appeared {{to be able to}} generalise the orientation discrimination to illusory contours. These results demonstrate that redtail splitfins are capable of perceiving illusory contours...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium griseum) {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to {{perceive}} subjective and illusionary contours as well as line length illusions. Individuals were first trained to differentiate between squares, triangles and rhomboids in a series of two alternative forced-choice experiments. Transfer tests then elucidated whether <b>Kanizsa</b> squares and <b>triangles,</b> grating gaps and phase shifted abutting gratings were also perceived and distinguished. The visual systems of most vertebrates and even invertebrates perceive illusionary contours despite the absence of physical luminance, colour or textural differences. Sharks are no exception to the rule; all tasks were successfully mastered within 3 to 24 training sessions, with sharks discriminating between various sets of Kanizsa figures and alternative stimuli, as well as between subjective contours in > 75 % of all tests. However, in contrast to Kanizsa figures and subjective contours, sharks were not deceived by Müller-Lyer (ML) illusions. Here, two centre lines of equal length are comparatively set between two arrowheads or –tails, in which case the line featuring the two arrow tails appears to be longer to most humans, primates and birds. In preparation for this experiment, lines of varying length, and lines of unequal length randomly featuring either two arrowheads or -tails on their ends, were presented first. Both sets of lines were successfully distinguished by most sharks. However, during presentation of the ML illusions sharks failed to succeed and succumbed either to side preferences or chose according to chance...|$|R
40|$|A regular, grouped <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> {{has been}} shown to break through interocular {{suppression}} faster than an ungrouped, random <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> [Wang et al., 2012, PLoS ONE, 7 (6) : e 40106]. In an earlier neuropsychological study Conci et al. [2009, Neuropsychologia, 47, 726 - 732] showed that low-level collinear contour facilitation and high-level surface filling-in both contribute separately to a reduction in extinction in patients with visual neglect when viewing Kanizsa stimuli. Since Wang et al. (2012) did not include control conditions similar to Conci et al. (2009), {{it is not clear whether}} the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> broke through suppression due to collinear contour facilitation or higher-level surface completion mechanisms [Kogo et al., 2010, Psychological Review, 117 (2), 406 - 439]. In this study, we compared suppression times of regular and random versions of a Kanizsa square, a cross stimulus (allowing collinear contour facilitation but no surface completion) and a surface stimulus (allowing surface completion but no collinear contour facilitation). Our results suggest that neither collinear contour facilitation nor surface completion mechanisms play a primary role in determining suppression times. Rather, the regularity of the stimulus seems to play a crucial role. This hypothesis was tested further by breaking down the regularity of the different classes of stimuli...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSynchronized {{high-frequency}} gamma band oscillations (30 – 100 Hz) {{are thought}} to mediate the binding of single visual features into whole-object representations. For example, induced gamma band oscillations (iGBRs) have been recorded ∼ 280 ms after the onset of a coherent <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle,</b> but not after an incoherent equivalent shape. However, several recent studies have provided evidence that the EEG-recorded iGBR may be a by-product of small saccadic eye movements (microsaccades). Considering these two previous findings, one would hypothesis {{that there should be}} more microsaccades following the onset of a coherent <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle.</b> However, we found that microsaccade rebound rate was significantly higher after an incoherent triangle was presented. This result suggests that microsaccades are not a reliable indicator of perceptual binding, and, more importantly, implies that iGBR cannot be universally produced by ocular artefacts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how perceptual binding and selective attention operate during infants' and adults' visual search of an illusory figure. An eye-tracker system was used to test adults and infants in two conditions: illusory and non-illusory (real). In the illusory condition, a <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> was embedded among distractor pacmen which did not generate illusory contours. In the non-illusory condition, a real triangle was included in the same pacmen's display. The results showed that adults detected both the Kanizsa and the real figure automatically and without focal attention (experiment 1). In contrast, 6 -month-old infants showed a pop-out effect only for the real figure (experiment 2). The failure of the illusory figure to trigger infants' attention was not due to infants' inability to perceive the illusory figure per se, as infants preferred the illusory figure over a non-illusory control stimulus in a classical preferential-looking task (experiment 3). Overall, these findings indicate that the illusory <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> triggers visual attention in adults, but not in infants, supporting evidence that at 6 months of age the binding processes involved in the perception of a Kanizsa figure do not operate in an adult-like manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether conscious experience is best viewed as graded or dichotomous has received much scientific attention {{in recent years as}} the answer is relevant not only to models of consciousness, but also to the examination of neural markers of consciousness in patients and infants. Although some studies have found evidence of graded perception, it is unclear whether such perception is simply composed of individual stimulus features perceived in an all-or-none manner. Here, we examined whether the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> (an illusory figure that is supposedly only perceived when all its parts are visible) has an impact on line length discrimination across four degrees of subjective visibility. We found that the presence of the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> biases line length judgments (a phenomenon called the Ponzo illusion) when participants reported any experience (even a weak glimpse) of the stimulus. The results support the view that consciousness is a graded phenomenon. The strength of this support depends on the assumption that all parts of the illusory figure must be perceived for the illusion to work but this assumption is not resolved in the present literature. Currently, evidence can be found both for and against this notion...|$|E

Such simultaneous bright-ness contrast (SBC) is observed, for example, when a gray circle appears brighter against a dark background than against a light background (Fig. 1 a). Similarly, spatially distinct ele-ments of a visual scene can induce an illusory percept of lumi-nance contours if the organization of those elements induces the visual system to extrapolate {{the presence of an}} occluding surface (Fig. 1 b), as in the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> illusion (Kanizsa...|$|E
40|$|We used {{magnetoencephalography}} (MEG) {{to examine}} the nature of oscillatory brain rhythms when passively viewing both illusory and real visual contours. Three stimuli were employed: a Kanizsa triangle; a <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> with a real triangular contour superimposed; and a control figure in which the corner elements used to form the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> were rotated to negate the formation of illusory contours. The MEG data were analysed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) to enable the spatial localisation of task-related oscillatory power changes within specific frequency bands, and the time-course of activity within given locations-of-interest was determined by calculating time-frequency plots using a Morlet wavelet transform. In contrast to earlier studies, {{we did not find}} increases in gamma activity (> 30 Hz) to illusory shapes, but instead a decrease in 10 - 30 Hz activity approximately 200 ms after stimulus presentation. The reduction in oscillatory activity was primarily evident within extrastriate areas, including the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Importantly, this same pattern of results was evident for each stimulus type. Our results further highlight the importance of the LOC and a network of posterior brain regions in processing visual contours, be they illusory or real in nature. The similarity of the results for both real and illusory contours, however, leads us to conclude that the broadband (< 30 Hz) decrease in power we observed is more likely to reflect general changes in visual attention than neural computations specific to processing visual contours. © 2009 Elsevier B.

We consider here two cases, the first one is to find the illusory figures with exact known shape, while the second case permits an ofine transformation of known shape, which allows a much loxger classes of illusory figures to be found.

40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera, worker) {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} between two random gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other. This task was quickly learned with vertical, horizontal, and oblique gratings. After being trained on perpendicularly-oriented random gratings, bees could discriminate between other perpendicularly-oriented patterns (black bars, white bars, thin lines, edges, spatial sinusoids, broken bars) as well. Several tests indicate that the stimuli were not discriminated {{on the basis of}} a literal image (eidetic template), but, rather, on the basis of orientation as a single parameter. An attempt to train bees to discriminate between two different random gratings oriented in the same direction was not successful, also indicating that the bees were not able to form a template of random gratings. Preliminary experiments with oriented 'Kanizsa rectangles' (analogue of <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle)</b> suggest that edge detection in the bee may involve mechanisms similar to those that lead to the percept of illusory contours in humans. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} {{of even the}} most elementary features of the visual environment depends strongly on their spatial context. In the study reported here, we asked at what level of abstraction such effects require conscious processing of the context. We compared two visual illusions that alter subjective judgments of brightness: the simultaneous brightness contrast illusion, in which two circles of identical physical brightness appear different because of different surround luminance, and the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> illusion, which occurs when the visual system extrapolates a surface without actual physical stimulation. We used a novel interocular masking technique that allowed us to selectively render only the context invisible. Simultaneous brightness contrast persisted even when the surround was masked from awareness. In contrast, participants did not experience illusory contours when the inducing context was masked. Our findings show that invisible context is resolvable by low-level processes involved in surface-brightness perception, but not by high-level processes that assign surface borders through perceptual completion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{representation and}} logic for labeling contrast edges and ridges in visual scenes {{in terms of}} both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, specifically contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we define a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy configuration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour figures such as the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>Triangle,</b> as well as more difficult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost. ...|$|E
30|$|On a perceptual level, {{there is}} a strong {{tendency}} of the visual system to complete missing information. If a circle is partly occluded by a square, for example, one still perceives the circle through amodal completion (Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2001). This strong tendency even involves the perception of illusory objects, such as the perception of the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> through modal completion. The tendency to complete missing information occurs also in settings involving spatiotemporal information. If two circles appear sequentially at different locations, for example, the objects are not perceived as separate objects but as the same object linked by apparent motion as long as the objects stay within certain spatiotemporal boundaries (Larsen, Farrell, & Bundesen, 1983). This is also true for the tunnel effect (Burke, 1952) that describes the finding that observers perceive a single object passing through an occluder if they see an object moving toward the occluder that is reappearing {{from the other side of}} the occluder after a certain amount of time. Observers even perceive one object passing through the occluder if object features differ between entering and leaving the occluder (Burke, 1952).|$|E
40|$|Research on {{the neural}} {{processing}} of optical illusions can provide clues {{for understanding the}} neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Previous {{studies have shown that}} some visual areas contribute to the perception of optical illusions such as the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> and Müller-Lyer figure; however, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of these and other optical illusions have not been clearly identified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we determined which brain regions are active during the perception of optical illusions. For our study, we enrolled 18 participants. The illusory optical stimuli consisted of many kana letters, which are Japanese phonograms. During the shape task, participants stated aloud whether they perceived the shapes of two optical illusions as being the same or not. During the word task, participants read aloud the kana letters in the stimuli. A direct comparison between the shape and word tasks showed activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, and right pulvinar. It is well known that there are two visual pathways, the geniculate and extrageniculate systems, which belong to the higher-level and primary visual systems, respectively. The pulvinar belongs to the latter system, and the findings of the present study suggest that the extrageniculate system is involved in the cognitive processing of optical illusions...|$|E
30|$|Visual curve {{completion}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in understanding {{the principles of the}} human visual system. This problem is usually divided into two problems: a grouping problem and a shape problem. On one hand, though perception of the visually completed curve is clearly a global task (for example, a human perceives the <b>Kanizsa</b> <b>triangle</b> only when seeing all three black objects), conventional methods for solving the grouping problem are generally based on local Gestalt laws. On the other hand, the shape of the visually completed curve is usually recovered by minimizing shape energy in existing methods. However, not only do these methods lack mechanisms to adjust the shape of the recovered visual curve using perceptual, psychophysical, and neurophysiological knowledge, but it is also difficult to calculate an explicit representation of the visually completed curve. In this paper, we present a systematic computational model for generating a visually completed curve. Firstly, based on recent studies of perception, psychophysics, and neurophysiology, we formulate a grouping procedure based on the human visual system by seeking a minimum Hamiltonian cycle in a graph, solving the grouping problem in a global manner. Secondly, we employ a Bézier curve-based model to represent the visually completed curve. Not only is an explicit representation deduced, but we also present a means to integrate knowledge from related areas, such as perception, psychophysics, and neurophysiology, and so on. The proposed computational model has been validated using many modal and amodal completion examples, and desirable results were obtained.|$|E
