5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or <b>drape</b> (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to <b>drape</b> coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E

5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind <b>drape</b> over Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{development}} of a <b>draping</b> index for fabric simulation. The goal is to define and estimate the fabric’s <b>draping</b> parameters for computer modeling. Using the definition, a methodology for determining the <b>draping</b> properties of the fabric can be obtained by analyzing the contour of a digital image of a fully <b>draped</b> fabric. The material parameters can be input into a physical-based cloth modeling system for <b>draping</b> simulation purposes. Three steps are associated with this method. The first one is a fabric <b>draping</b> measuring system designed to capture the fabric <b>draping</b> images. The second one is a computer simulation system adapted for simulating the <b>draping</b> behavior of fabric using the measured <b>draping</b> index. The third one is a correlation system, designed to relate the <b>draped</b> fabric images against the computer simulation result to derive the <b>draping</b> index. The <b>draping</b> Index in this thesis classifies fabrics into five categories. The main contribution of this research is to provide an effective and scientific method to determine the <b>draping</b> properties of any given fabric and integrate its usage into computer simulation. The method utilizes a very simple set up as compared with established methods such as Kawabata Evaluation System. Only a digital camera is needed, the calibrated setup occupies a small space and can be used anywhere...|$|R

5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that <b>drape</b> the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which <b>drape</b> behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{last season}} for the Melbourne Cricket Club came in 1893–94. He missed the first two premiership matches of the season, but after top scoring with 47 and taking two wickets in a non-premiership match against Fitzroy, Wilson was {{selected}} for the third match, against North Melbourne. Wilson took 1/72 in the first innings against North, the wicket being that of Isaac <b>Drape,</b> and scored 27 runs batting an number 10. He was not called upon to bat or bowl in the second innings. Wilson was retained in the side for the next match against Carlton. He batted at 11 in the first innings and was on 0 not out when the innings closed. Wilson was not required to bowl or bat again in what ended up being his final match for the MCC. In total, he played 14 matches for Melbourne for a return of 138 runs at a batting average of 10.61 and 15 wickets at a bowling average of 30.73.|$|E

50|$|Moore made {{a series}} of sculptures of <b>draped</b> human forms in the 1950s after he was {{commissioned}} to create a sculpture for the new UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris. He wanted to create a figure in an architectural context, and turned to the seated human form. His <b>Draped</b> Reclining Figure, 1952-53 was a precursor to these later <b>draped</b> figures. He completed the first major work in the series in 1955, with a maquette, <b>Draped</b> Seated Woman: Figure on Steps (LH 427), cast in a series of 10. This became the working model for the full-size sculpture that became his <b>Draped</b> Seated Woman 1957-58. The reclining figure is a dominant theme of Moore's work, with perhaps half of his sculptures in a reclining position. He made a similar work in a reclining position, <b>Draped</b> Reclining Woman 1957-58. Moore ultimately abandoned these ideas for the UNESCO commission, and his UNESCO Reclining Figure 1957-58 (LH 416) is a much more abstract reclining form in travertine.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of carbon fibre reinforced plastics, short CFRP, are highly sensitive to its respective fibre angles. Small deviations {{result in a}} high decrease of stiffness in the manufactured parts. In the first steps of industrial engineering for CFRP parts, <b>draping</b> simulations are used to give an approximation of fibre angles that the real <b>draped</b> fabrics adjust to when <b>draped</b> in its three dimensional state. Since the <b>draping</b> simulations are based on mathematical models they do not match the <b>draping</b> results of the manual performed production processes. In order to compensate these manufacture errors, tolerance ranges for fibre angle deviations are set very high. One way to control the fibre angle after <b>draping</b> is to use optical camera systems for quality assurance. The approach at DLR Augsburg to measure fibre angles is realised with a CCD camera, which is mounted on an industrial robot. The measurement system is highly sensitive regarding the reference orientation. Every deviation from the normal axis results in deviation of the measured angle. The setup with the robot guaranties high reproducibility in measurements and a high accuracy to the reference. In this paper a specified cut piece was used to perform <b>draping</b> simulations with different mathematical models. The cut piece was manually <b>draped</b> onto a tooling. The resulting fibre angles were measured with the robot controlled measurement system. In the end a comparison between the simulated and <b>draped</b> fibre angles was done. The result provides hints which solver delivers the lowest errors for the <b>draped</b> cut piece. With this information the tolerance ranges could be reduced which lead to fewer plies of carbon fibres. Less carbon fibres lead to less material cost, weight and manufacturing time...|$|R
40|$|Several cloth {{modeling}} {{techniques have}} been proposed. Their main purpose is the realistic simulation of the garments of virtual actors for entertainment and advertising. In these areas, {{the main concern}} is to construct fast algorithms, able to produce impressive and qualitatively satisfactory <b>draping</b> of clothes. Other applications, as designing, manufacturing and selling real garments, call for a virtual <b>draping</b> which not only satisfies the human eye, but also closely mimics the real physical <b>draping</b> of clothes. From this viewpoint we will discuss some modeling techniques, and present some result concerning the quantitative comparison between the <b>draping</b> of real clothes and their virtual counterpart...|$|R

It is the afternoon <b>draping</b> ceremony in which the Kamehameha Statue in front of Aliiolani Hale and Iolani Palace on King Street in downtown Honolulu is <b>draped</b> in long strands of lei. The same is done at the Kamehameha Statue on the former monarch's home island, the Big Island of Hawaii. Outside of the state, a similar <b>draping</b> ceremony is held at the United States Capitol where the Kamehameha Statue there is also <b>draped</b> in lei {{in the company of}} federal officials.|$|R

40|$|When the interplanetary {{magnetic}} field (IMF) encounters the Earth's magnetosphere, it is compressed and distorted. This distortion {{is known as}} <b>draping,</b> and {{plays an important role}} in the interaction between the IMF and the geo{{magnetic field}}. This paper considers a particular aspect of <b>draping,</b> namely how the orientation of the IMF in a plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line (the clock angle) is altered by <b>draping</b> in the magnetosheath close to the dayside magnetopause. The clock angle of the magnetosheath field is commonly estimated from the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) measured by upstream monitoring spacecraft either by assuming that the <b>draping</b> process does not significantly alter the clock angle ("perfect draping") or that the change in clock angle is reasonably approximated by a gas dynamic model. In this paper, the magnetosheath clock angles measured during 36 crossings of the magnetopause by the Geotail and Interball-Tail spacecraft are compared to the upstream IMF clock angles measured by the Wind spacecraft. Overall, about 30 % of data points exhibit perfect <b>draping</b> within &plusmn; 10 &deg;, and 70 % are within 30 &deg;. The differences between the IMF and magnetosheath clock angles are not, in general, well-ordered in any systematic fashion which could be accounted for by hydrodynamic <b>draping.</b> The <b>draping</b> behaviour is asymmetric with respect to the y-component of the IMF, and the form of the <b>draping</b> distribution function is dependent on solar wind pressure. While the average clock angle observed in the magnetosheath does reflect the orientation of the IMF to within ~ 30 &deg; or less, the assumption that the magnetosheath field direction at any particular region of the magnetopause at any instant is approximately similar to the IMF direction is not justified. This study shows that reconnection models which assume laminar <b>draping</b> are unlikely to accurately reflect the distribution of reconnection sites across the dayside magnetopause...|$|R
