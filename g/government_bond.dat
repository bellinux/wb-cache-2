Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E

In 2012, Fitch Group upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade after an 18-year gap; {{this was followed by}} a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> ratings to the lowest investment grade Baa3. In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status. In the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for investment during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government since 2002 had mostly been consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic growth. Private bank debts in Turkey were 6.6 billion TL in 2002 and had increased to 385 billion TL by the end of 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} that {{expansion of}} <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> {{in the late}} 1970 s {{was caused by a}} control of the former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. The government budgeted 2 trillion yen for revenue generated by the <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> in the 1975 fiscal year and 15. 3 trillion yen in the 1979 fiscal year. They expanded to 7. 65 times in only four years. The budgets were formulated according to an economic plan developed in 1976. Although the plan controlled the budget inflation, the government depended on the <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> because of shortage of tax revenue. As a result, the <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> expanded rapidly but the plan was realized. The economic plan was formulated in the Takeo Miki Cabinet, not in the Tanaka Cabinet. However, the plan was in accordance with part of a 10 year economic plan which was examined but not developed by Tanaka cabinet. Mr. Tanaka controlled the budgets in order to realize the plan in the Tanaka Cabinet. As a result, <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> were the inflated in the late 1970 s.

25|$|There is {{no single}} yield curve {{describing}} the cost of money for everybody. The {{most important factor in}} determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness. The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} effective interest rate proxies for equity and mortgage REITs, this study analyzes seven different interest rate proxies that {{have been widely used}} in the REIT literature. They are the monthly holding period returns on long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> and high-grade corporate bonds, the percentage changes in yields for long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> and high-yield (Baa) corporate bonds, the difference between returns on long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> and T-bill rates, the spread between yields on high-yield (Baa) corporate bonds and returns on long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds,</b> and the spread between returns on high-grade corporate bonds and returns on long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds.</b> The overall OLS results suggest that mortgage REITs are sensitive to all proxies, while equity REITs are significantly affected by only changes in yields on long-term U. S. <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> and high-yield corporate bonds. The time variation paths for sensitivities indicate that all interest rate sensitivities are time specific. Overall, the changes in yields on high-yield corporate bonds (Baa) has the strongest explanatory power for returns of equity and mortgage REITs for most of the 27 -year sample period (1972 through 1998) ...|$|R

500|$|The {{consensus}} among MacGregor's biographers is that Britain {{in the early}} 1820s could hardly have suited him and his Poyais scheme better. Amid a general growth in the British economy following the Battle of Waterloo {{and the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars, interest rates were dropping and the British <b>government</b> <b>bond,</b> the [...] "consol", offered rates of only 3% per annum on the London Stock Exchange. Those wanting a higher return invested in more risky foreign debt. After continental European bonds were popular in the immediate post-Waterloo years, the Latin American revolutions brought a raft of new alternatives to the London market, starting with the £2million loan issued for Gran Colombia (incorporating both New Granada and Venezuela) in March 1822. Bonds from Colombia, Peru, Chile and others, offering interest rates as high as 6% per annum, made Latin American securities extremely popular on the London market—a trend on which a nation like the Poyais described by MacGregor would be ideally positioned to capitalise.|$|E

2500|$|The example {{given in}} {{the table at the}} right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is {{constructed}} using either LIBOR rates or swap rates. [...] A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. [...] If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. [...] The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders. [...] For the U. S. market, a common benchmark for such a spread is given by the so-called TED spread.|$|E
