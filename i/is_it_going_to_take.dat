40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainability}} incentive schemes to support living system changes {{are greater than}} ever {{at all levels of}} Government. The key drivers for this change are global climate change, global peak oil and the massive overshoot of the renewable capacity of the world's natural systems (natural capital). The level of change required will need to be nothing less than revolutionary. Revolutionary not in an anarchic sense, but revolutionary in the way our whole way of living is directed, designed and structured in its relationship to the natural world around us, and the way we interact with it. The system changes required are beyond the scope of any one individual, organisation, community or region. It will require unified action, carefully targeted to best provide support to enable individuals to make all necessary changes to sustainable patterns of resource consumption to which they have 'control over', further to that needed to be implemented by Local and State Government services and infrastructure along with that of private industry and commerce.
