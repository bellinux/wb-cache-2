25|$|In 1937, Vargas began drawing La Familia Burrón as a {{separate}} piece which documented parents, Regino Burrón and Borola Tacuche de Burrón, their two teenage children, Regino and Macuca Burrón, and Foforito Cantarranas, a younger <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the Burróns. La Familia Burrón profiled a lower class family's daily comedic struggles in an impoverished Mexican barrio. At the height of its popularity, the comic strip helped circulation sales to reach 500,000 copies a week. The comic was temporarily suspended but resumed in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{who would later}} become the Yellow Kid first {{appeared on the scene}} in a minor supporting role in cartoon panel published in Truth magazine in 1894 and 1895. The four different black-and-white single panel cartoons were deemed popular, and one of them, Fourth Ward Brownies, was reprinted on 17 February 1895 in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, where Outcault worked as a technical drawing artist. The World published another, newer Hogan's Alley cartoon less than a month later, and this was followed by the strip's first color printing on 5 May 1895. Hogan's Alley gradually became a full-page Sunday color cartoon with the Yellow <b>Kid</b> (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> also appearing several times a week) as its lead character.|$|E

500|$|Witwer {{compared}} him {{as being}} [...] "two parts Han Solo, one part Darth Maul, one part Indiana Jones [...] and then one essential part Luke Skywalker", noting that in the character's development [...] "behind it all, {{there had to be}} this wide-eyed <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to figure out what}} the hell to do". According to Witwer, Starkiller's characteristics and personality depended on who he was talking to and what circumstances he is in. Witwer called him [...] "a really interesting guy, speaking of layered characters". Although acting as a villain in the beginning of the , Blackman has commented how Starkiller is [...] "really just this damaged kid." ...|$|E
500|$|The band formed while Chippendale and Gibson {{attended}} the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island, and Chippendale {{had heard about}} [...] "a new <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a whiz on the bass guitar." [...] The two formed Lightning Bolt, with Brian Chippendale on drums, Brian Gibson on bass guitar, and with Hisham Bharoocha on guitar and vocals joining the group after their first show. Bharoocha left the group in 1996 to continue with another RISD band that would eventually become Black Dice, and Chippendale took over vocal duties. The only officially released music with Bharoocha was a track on the Repopulation Program compilation. For the first few years, Lightning Bolt was primarily an improvisational band, touring the United States {{for months at a}} time and [...] "just playing". The concept of writing songs and recording an album didn't occur to the band until 1997, when Ben McOsker, founder of Load Records, approached the duo.|$|E
500|$|Several feuds {{surrounded}} the opening match, which saw {{the team of}} Razor Ramon, Marty Jannetty, the 1–2–3 Kid and Mr. Perfect face the team of Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.), Diesel, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Diesel made his WWF debut on June 6, 1993 as a bodyguard for Shawn Michaels in a match between Michaels and Jannetty. Diesel's interference in the match helped Michaels to defeat Jannetty and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Diesel was also at ringside to help Michaels when Michaels faced Mr. Perfect for the title belt at SummerSlam 1993. Diesel attacked Perfect on multiple occasions during the match and ultimately caused Perfect to lose the match via countout. In September 1993, Michaels was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship by WWF President Jack Tunney. A battle royal was scheduled to determine the top two contenders for the championship. Ramon and Martel were the last two wrestlers in the ring, and they faced {{each other in a}} title match on the September 27 episode of Monday Night Raw. Ramon won the match and was awarded the championship belt. Schyster had initiated a feud with Ramon in May 1993 after Ramon lost a match to The Kid (later the 1–2–3 <b>Kid),</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> competing as a jobber at the time. Schyster and his tag team partner Ted DiBiase made fun of Ramon for the loss and offered him a job as a servant. [...] In response, Ramon teamed with the 1–2–3 Kid for a series of matches against Schyster and DiBiase, and he also distracted Schyster during a match and caused him to lose to jobber P.J. Walker. Adam Bomb was not involved in any feuds with his opponents at Survivor Series, but there was animosity between Bomb and his teammate Rick Martel. Bomb's manager, Harvey Wippleman, was at ringside to help Martel in a match against Ramon. Wippleman was {{standing in the way of}} the match, and Martel ran in to him. While Martel was distracted, Ramon pinned him to win the match. Martel then yelled at Wippleman and pushed him. Bomb came to the ring to defend his manager, and an argument ensued until Diesel and Schyster came to the ring to calm their teammates.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1984, Snuka became {{embroiled in}} a feud {{with one of the}} WWF's top villains, [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper. In a segment of Piper's Pit, Piper hit Snuka {{on the back of the}} head with a coconut. The attack led to a series of grudge matches between the two that were played out over venues across the US {{throughout}} the summer of 1984. In late 1984, Snuka entered a rehabilitation facility; the WWF created a storyline in which Piper had broken Snuka's neck by hitting him over the head with a chair. The Tonga <b>Kid,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> billed as Snuka's nephew, continued the feud on Snuka's behalf.|$|E
2500|$|Erica is a headstrong {{and selfish}} 15-year-old when All My Children begins in 1970. Although Nixon {{designed}} her {{as one of}} the bad characters, she was not intended to come off as evil or menacing. Since Nixon created All My Children as a [...] "light hearted" [...] soap opera, the series' villains, Erica included, came across as more fun and funny, than wicked. Over time, Erica evolved into a [...] "heroine-vixen" [...] who still did bad things, but was also a character the audience rooted for. Former associate producer Felicia Minei Behr said, [...] "The Erica that [...] started with, was a <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> one-dimensional, who was the rotten seed, and she turned her into a very fascinating character- the character that everybody loves to hate." [...] Characterized as the [...] "naughty girl in town" [...] from the start, her motivations stem from her relationship with her father. Her abandonment by him led her to be written as sexually aggressive with men. She needs to receive love from men to prove she is not unlovable.|$|E

The date tallied with the sheriff's information. But the kid was still behind somewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the time I was praying that the kid wouldn't wake up, come down out of the cab, and put the [...] "kibosh" [...] on me.|$|E
