50|$|Rubber cups, {{also called}} prophy cups, {{are used in}} the <b>hand-piece.</b> Polishing paste, {{prophylactic}} paste, usually containing fluoride, is used with the rubber cups for polishing. Rubber cups should not be used over the cementum area as it may remove a layer of cementum at the cervical area. There are two popular types of prophy cups: 4 webs and 6 webs. Risk of generating frictional heat, and increased abrasion to the tooth surface may result from increased contact time, increased speed of rotation, and increased pressure of the cup on the tooth. Short intermittent strokes should be used in order to avoid damage.|$|E
5000|$|In most {{countries}} like Australia with large sheep flocks, the shearer {{is one of}} a contractor's team that go from property to property shearing sheep and preparing the wool for market. A workday starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four “runs” of two hours each. “Smoko” breaks of a half hour each are at 9:30 am and again at 3 pm. The lunch break is taken at 12 midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece rate, i.e., per sheep. The shearer collects a sheep from a catching pen, positions it on his “stand” on the shearing board and operates the shearing <b>hand-piece.</b> A shearer begins by removing the wool over the sheep's belly, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout while the sheep is still being shorn. The remainder of the fleece is taken off in one piece by following an efficient set of movements.|$|E

A near-point near infrared laser water treatment apparatus for use in dental <b>hand-pieces</b> was also developed [3]. To date water sterilisation research using a mid-IR laser technique is very rare. According to the World Health Organisation [4], examinations for faecal indicator bacteria remain the most sensitive and specific way of assessing the hygienic quality of water. Bacteria that fall into this group are E. coli, other coliform bacteria (including E. cloacae) {{and to a lesser}} extent, faecal streptococci [5]. Protozoan cysts from organisms which cause giardiasis are the most frequently identified cause of waterborne diseases in developed countries [6, 7]. The use of aerobic bacterial endospores to monitor the efficiency of various water treatments has been shown to provide a reliable and simple indicator of overall performance of water treatment[8, 9]. The efficacy of IR radiation for water disinfection compared to UV treatment has been further investigated in the present study. In addition FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with Principle Component Analysis was used to characterise structural changes within the bacterial cells and endospores following IR laser treatment. Changes in carbohydrate content of E. cloacae following IR laser treatment were observed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to detect {{free-living}} Amoebae (FLA) by morphological methods and to identify Acanthamoeba spp. by PCR in the dental unit water lines (DUWL). Materials and methods: it was a prospective study dealing with 196 water samples collected from DUWL (94 samples taken {{in the early morning}} before materials flush and patient consultations and 102 samples taken after consultations). At the same time, 39 samples from tap water were realized. Results: 135 (69 %) samples were positives by the morphological study with morphotypical diversity. The predominant morphotype was the monopodial (39. 2 %). 18 strains of Acanthamoeba spp. were detected in DUW (13. 3 %) and three strains in tap water (10 %). The amplification of 18 S rDNA gene of these strains of Acanthamoeba spp. was positive for all samples. Conclusion: the FLA and Acanthamoeba were isolated both in tap water and in dental unit. The amoeba pathogenicity has not been demonstrated after oral or dental contamination; but the presence of intracellular and pathogenic bacteria in the amoeba could be a source of microbiological risks for patients in case of deep dental care or immunodepression.

40|$|Introduction: During enamel cleanup {{after the}} removal of fixed appliances, aerosols, splatter, and dust are {{produced}} that can be inhaled. Although most inhaled particles are harmless, some might be associated with chronic diseases. Modern laboratory methods can now accurately simulate the human lung and predict the site of deposition of these inhaled particles. Methods: Orthodontic brackets and bands were attached to extracted teeth to simulate complete dental arches. Four variations of enamel cleanup were used: the variables were <b>hand-piece</b> speed and {{presence or absence of}} water. Air sampling was conducted by using a cascade impactor, and the filter media collected from each experiment were viewed under a scanning electron microscope to locate the particulate matter. X-ray microanalysis was used to identify particle composition. Results: The amount of debris deposited on the filter media was highly variable. The combination of fast hand piece with water irrigation demonstrated the highest concentration of debris deposited at the greatest depth in the (artificial) lung. Although the particles {{are most likely to be}} deposited in the conducting airways and terminal bronchi, some might be deposited in the terminal alveoli of the lungs and cleared only after weeks or months. The most common elements identified were calcium, phosphorus, silica, and aluminum. Other elements included iron and lanthanum.

Manual scaling and machinery (use of ultrasonic scaling and <b>hand-pieces)</b> showed higher loads on the trapezius muscles, regarding muscular rest, as well as the 10 th and 50 th percentiles, than the other tasks, and for the forearm extensor muscles, an almost complete lack of muscular rest (0. 1 % time), and much higher loads regarding the 10 th and 50 th percentiles. Further, more pronounced head flexion and lower head and upper arm velocities were found, indicating more constrained postures for the neck and shoulders for the manual scaling and machinery. Use of ultrasonic scaler reduced the 50 th percentile loads on the right forearm extensor muscles, but had no effect on the fraction of muscular rest and on the 10 th percentile load.

From 342 potentially eligible studies, 73 were selected for full-text analysis, 30 were included in the systematic review with 20 considered in the meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5. 1, with random effects model, at a significance level of 0. 05. A descriptive analysis considering phase transformation, Y-TZP grain size, Vickers hardness, residual stress and aging of all included studies were executed. Four outcomes were considered in the meta-analyses (factor: grinding x as-sintered) in global and subgroups analyses (grinding tool, grit-size and cooling) for flexural strength and roughness (Ra) data. A significant difference (p< 0. 05) was observed in the global analysis for strength, favoring as-sintered; subgroup analyses revealed that different parameters lead to different effects on strength. In the global analysis for roughness, a significant difference (p< 0. 05) was observed between conditions, favoring grinding; subgroup analyses revealed that different parameters also lead to different effects on roughness. High heterogeneity was found in some comparisons. Generally grinding promotes decrease in strength and increase in roughness of Y-TZP ceramics. However, the use of a grinding tool that allows greater accuracy of the movement (i. e. contra angle <b>hand-pieces</b> coupled to slowspeed turbines), small grit size (< 50 μm) and the use of plenty coolant seem to be the main factors to decrease the defect introduction and allow the occurrence of the toughening transformation mechanism, decreasing the risk of deleterious impact on Y-TZP mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION : The study {{compared}} {{modification of}} canal curvature and {{the incidence of}} canal aberrations after glide path preparation using four different instrumentation techniques. METHODS : One hundred and twenty S-shaped Endo- Training-Blocks were selected, the canals coloured with ink and digital images acquired. Glide paths were prepared by a single operator with stainless steel K-files by hand (Group 1), stainless steel K-files in a reciprocating hand piece (Group 2), PathFile (Group 3) and X-Plorer files (Group 4). Pre-instrumentation and post-instrumentation images were superimposed to evaluate the parameters investigated. The images were also examined by three blinded operators {{for the presence of}} aberrations. Differences in canal curvature modification were analysed with respect to logarithmic transformed change from baseline using ANCOVA (p< 0. 001) with logarithmic transformed pre-instrumentation values as covariate. The incidence of canal aberrations was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS : There was no difference between PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p< 0. 001) and both systems demonstrated significantly less modification of curvature compared with hand files and hand files in a reciprocating <b>hand-piece</b> (p< 0. 001). The Groups differed significantly regarding the number of aberrations (p= 0. 005). Hand files and hand files in the reciprocating hand piece did not differ statistically (p= 0. 254; 20 % and 6. 67 %). However, hand files in reciprocating hand piece also did not differ significantly from PathFiles and X-Plorer files (p= 0. 326). There were no aberrations detected in the rotary NiTi Groups. CONCLUSION : The stainless steel K-files in the reciprocating <b>hand-piece</b> performed better than their use by hand only. Overall, PathFiles and X-Plorer files equally demonstrated the least modification to original canal geometry. Further research utilising the different techniques in extracted teeth is warranted.

40|$|Background/purpose: Ultrasonic {{osteotomy}} {{has been}} introduced in oral and maxillofacial surgery in recent years for minimally invasive treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the cutting performance of three different coated tips by the material removal rate (MRR) measurement and the temperature rise (TR) investigation in ultrasonic osteotomy. Materials and methods: Three stainless steel tips with different coated treatments to have the coefficients of friction of 0. 5, 0. 4, and 0. 1 for uncoated tip, titanium nitride (TiN) coated tip, and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated tip, respectively, were tested. The tip was fixed in the <b>hand-piece</b> and powered by an ultrasonic device (Cur scale, Bonart, Taiwan) with power mode of 40, 45 and 50. The ultrasonic <b>hand-piece</b> was mounted on the column of the X-Y table, and a uniform down force of 3  N was provided by the voice coil motor. A groove on the bovine bone specimen was obtained as a result of the downward action together with ultrasonic vibration of the tip. The MMR and TR were measured and evaluated. Results: The average MMR for the DLC coated tip under the operation mode 50 of the ultrasonic device was 0. 164  mm 3 /s as compared with 0. 153  mm 3 /s of TiN coated tip and 0. 147  mm 3 /s of the uncoated tip. The average TR in 60 seconds operation was 8. 1 °C for the uncoated tip, 6. 8 °C for the TiN coated tip, and 4. 5 °C for the DLC coated tip. Conclusion: The DLC coated tip leads to the highest material removal rate and least temperature rise among the three types of tip under study. This is due to its low coefficient of friction and less power is needed to overcome the friction force in ultrasonic osteotomy...|$|E

Thus, {{to fulfill the}} need for a minimally invasive tool for contemporary endodontics and dentistry, the use of polymer fibers might provide a good option, as it is soft, fabricable, and disposable. In this study, two types of nylon fibers with respective average diameters of 206. 9 µm (fiber W) and 156. 4 µm (fiber B), respectively, were used as dental files, and mounted onto either a reciprocating or a low-speed rotary <b>hand-piece.</b> In vitro, simulated root canal models were colored red using nail varnish, and then cleaned by the fiber files mounted on the hand-pieces. Three parts of the simulated models, i. e., the apical third, the medium third, and the coronal third, were chosen to assess the cleaning the efficiency (CE) of each specimen by calculating the ratio of the cross-sectional area changes, before and after cleansing, using micro-Computer Tomography (CT). A NiTi file with a low-speed <b>hand-piece</b> was used as a control. SEM was used to observe the nylon fiber surfaces before and after the cleansing. Micro-CT results showed that for both the nylon fibers, W and B, an average CE of 82. 11 % ± 9. 68 % for the medium third could be achieved, which is statistically higher (p < 0. 01) than the coronal third and apical third. The cleansing efficiency was not affected by, the types of fibers, nor the hand-pieces according to student’s t-test. Most of the nylon fibers could withstand deformation after the cleansing. To conclude, nylon fiber files have demonstrated a certain cleansing efficiency in simulated root canals, and micro-CT is a promising method to assess CE...|$|E
40|$|Extracorporeal {{shock wave}} therapy (ESWT) is {{considered}} a viable treatment modality for orthopedic ailments. Despite increasing clinical use, the mechanisms by which ESWT devices generate a therapeutic effect are not yet understood. The mechanistic differences in various devices and their efficacies might be dependent on their acoustic and cavitation outputs. We report acoustic and cavitation measurements {{of a number of}} different shock wave therapy devices. Two devices were electrohydraulic: one had a large reflector (HMT Ossatron) and the other was a hand-held source (HMT Evotron); the other device was a pneumatically driven device (EMS Swiss DolorClast Vet). Acoustic measurements were made using a fiber-optic probe hydrophone and a PVDF hydrophone. A dual passive cavitation detection system was used to monitor cavitation activity. Qualitative differences between these devices were also highlighted using a high-speed camera. We found that the Ossatron generated focused shock waves with a peak positive pressure around 40 MPa. The Evotron produced peak positive pressure around 20 MPa, however, its acoustic output appeared to be independent of the power setting of the device. The peak positive pressure from the DolorClast was about 5 MPa without a clear shock front. The DolorClast did not generate a focused acoustic field. Shadowgraph images show that the wave propagating from the DolorClast is planar and not focused {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>hand-piece.</b> All three devices produced measurable cavitation with a characteristic time (cavitation inception to bubble collapse) that varied between 95 and 209 μs for the Ossatron, between 59 and 283 μs for the Evotron, and between 195 and 431 μs for the DolorClast. The high-speed camera images show that the cavitation activity for the DolorClast is primarily restricted to the contact surface of the <b>hand-piece.</b> These data indicate that the devices studied here vary in acoustic and cavitation output, which may imply that the mechanisms by which they generate therapeutic effects are different. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Primary snoring {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be a consequence of soft palate vibration caused by a partial upper airway collapse during sleep. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgical treatment used to remove tissue in the throat for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. UPPP is still the most frequently used surgical treatment for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. Innovative advances have recently introduced regarding instrumentation, energy sources, and devices aimed at facilitating surgical procedures in terms of efficient hemostasis, tissue legation and dissection, as well as reduction in surgical time: although curative for many patients, these procedures present side effects. The Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel® is an ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device. The equipment consists of a generator, an <b>hand-piece,</b> and specific inserts. The mechanism of the Harmonic Scalpel® (HS) is based on transforming electrical energy into mechanical movement of 55. 5 kHz frequency. The high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations produced by the HS cause an effect referred to as cavitation whereby the collagen and proteoglycans in the tissue become denatured and then combine with the tissue fluids to form a coagulum. The pressure exerted on the tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a hemostatic seal. The HS controls bleeding by coaptive coagulation at low temperatures, ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C. By contrast, electrosurgery and laser coagulate by burning (obliterative coagulation) at higher temperatures (150 - 400 °C). The vibration frequency of HS is optimal for soft tissue and does not cut mineralized tissue (lower frequency waves need to be utilized) In UPPP, among the available hand-pieces and inserts, a specific <b>hand-piece</b> and insert was preferred: the insert, shaped like scissor, had a sharp inner beveled radius forcutting under tension, a blunt outer radius for coaptive coagulation, and a flat side for surface coagulation. In all the patients treated, the HS allowed rapid and easy intraoperative management and a precise and safe cut, especially in difficult anatomic sites. The operating fields were blood free with perfect intraoperative visibility. These features facilitate the use of the HS in tight spaces, where precision is essential.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the whitening efficacy of three different oral rinses. Materials and methods: Eighty extracted teeth were randomly divided into four groups, cleaned with a slow-speed <b>hand-piece</b> with pumice and placed in a staining broth for 14 days. Measurements of tooth shades were measured with a spectrophotometer. Three groups (20 each) were then exposed to Colgate Plax Whitening Blancheur (A), White Glo 2 in 1 (B) and Plus White (C) for 21 days for 2 minutes a day and in between stored in artificial saliva. The other group acted as a control and was only stored in the artificial saliva. Results: The Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey-Kramer analysis showed no statistical significant differences (on a 5 % basis) for the differences between base-line and after treatment (21 days) for ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* and ΔE*ab median values amongst the control, Colgate Plax Whitening Blancheur, White Glo 2 in 1, and Plus White. Conclusion: None of the three commercially available oral rinses resulted in any significant bleaching effect on the teeth over a 21 day treatment period.

40|$|Objective: To {{measure and}} assess the noise levels {{produced}} by various dental equipments in different areas of a dental institution and to recommend improvements if noise levels are not within permissible limits. Material and Methods: Sound levels were measured at three different areas of a dental institution where learning and teaching activities are organized. The sound level was measured using a sound level meter known as ‘deci-bulolmeter’. In each area the noise level was assessed at two positions-one, at 6 inches from the operators ear and second, at the chairside instrument trolley. Noise levels were also assessed from a central location of the clinic area when multiple equipments were in operation simultaneously. Results: Dental laboratory machine, dental <b>hand-piece,</b> ultrasonic scalers, amalgamators, high speed evacuation, and other items produce noise at different sound levels which is appreciable. The noise levels generated varied between 72. 6 dB in pre-clinics and 87. 2 dB in prosthesis laboratory. The results are comparable {{to the results of}} other studies which are conducted elsewhere. Although the risk to the dentists is lesser, but damage to the hearing is possible over prolonged periods. Conclusion: Higher noise levels are potentially hazardous to the persons working in such environments especiall...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{introduce}} a new device specifically designed to evaluate the cutting efficiency of mechanically driven endodontic instruments. Material/Methods: Twenty new Reciproc R 25 (VDW, Munich, Germany) files were used to be investigated in the new device developed to test the cutting ability of endodontic instruments. The device consists of a main frame to which a mobile plastic support for the <b>hand-piece</b> is connected and a stainless-steel block containing a Plexiglas block against which the cutting efficiency of the instruments was tested. The length of the block cut in 1 minute was measured in a computerized program with a precision of 0. 1 mm. The instruments were activated by using a torque-controlled motor (Silver Reciproc; VDW, Munich, Germany) in a reciprocating movement by the "Reciproc ALL" program (Group 1) and in counter-clockwise rotation at 300 rpm (Group 2). Mean and standard deviations of each group were calculated and data were statistically analyzed with a one-way ANOVA test (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The cutting testing device evaluated in the present study was reliable and easy to use and may be effectively used to test cutting efficiency of both rotary and reciprocating mechanical endodontic instruments. © Med Sci Monit...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{standardized}} testing of dental rotary cutting instruments remains {{a problem because}} of the many significant parameters that require identi-fying and quantifying. In a previous study, <b>hand-piece</b> wear or degradation {{was identified as a}} potentially significant confounding variable leading to the suggestion that the use of industrial hand-pieces might be necessary. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to measure and compare industrial and dental air rotor degradation during a simulated diamond rotary cutting instrument test. Two dental and two industrial products were tested in a random sequence using three replicate samples of each air rotor. The simulated test consisted of 10 diamond instruments each making 90 passes through a float glass substrate. The testing apparatus comprised a computer-interfaced device that controlled the contact force between the cutting diamond and the substrate. Air rotor performance was based on the time required to cut a standardized path through the substrate. The performance change that occurred from diamond instrument to instrument during the simulated test was attributed to air rotor degradation. Multiple regression analyses showed significant differences between replicate samples of the same type and between regression intercepts for different air rotor types. Surprisingly, four air rotors exhibited improving performance during the simulated test. Changing air rotor performance must be considered to achieve reliability for the testing of diamond rotary cutting instruments. Key words: Rotary cutting instrument testing, air rotor wear...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the cutting efficiency of two new reciprocating instruments, Twisted File Adaptive and WaveOne Primary. Material and Methods: 10 new Twisted File Adaptive (TF Adaptive) (SybronEndo, Glendora, CA, USA) and 10 new WaveOne Primary files (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were activated using a torque-controlled motor, respectively TFA motor (SybronEndo, Glendora, CA, USA) and Silver motor (VDW, Munich, Germany). The device used for the cutting test consisted on a mainframe to which a mobile plastic support for the <b>hand-piece</b> is connected and a stainless-steel block containing a Plexiglas block against which the cutting efficiency of the instruments was tested. The length of the block cut in 1 minute was measured in a computerized program with a precision of 0. 1 mm. Mean and standard deviations of each group were calculated and data were statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni t test (P < 0. 05). Results: TF Adaptive displayed significantly greater maximum penetration depth than WaveOne Primary (P < 0. 05). In fact, TF Adaptive instruments (Group 1) cut the Plexiglas block to a mean depth of 8. 7 (SD 0. 5) mm, while WaveOne Primary instruments cut the Plexiglas block to a mean depth of 6. 4 (SD 0. 3) mm. Conclusions: Twisted File Adaptive instruments demonstrated statistically higher cutting efficiency than WaveOne instruments...|$|E
