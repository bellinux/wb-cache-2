40|$|Enamel {{thicknesses}} in 45,X females', {{their male}} and female relatives', and population control males' and females' permanent tooth crowns were determined from radiographs. The {{results showed that the}} enamel layer in both maxillary first incisors and canines of 45,X females is definitely thinner than that of control males or females. Enamel in control males' and females' teeth was about equal in size. The distance between mesial and distal <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junctions</b> or the thickness of "dentin" was similar in 45,X females' and in control females' teeth, but definitely smaller than in control males' teeth. These findings show that {{in the presence of the}} second sex-chromosome in the chromosome complement, whether X or Y, there is a definite and equal increase in the amount of enamel. On the other hand, in the presence of the Y chromosome in the chromosome complement, relative to the second X chromosome, there is a definite increase in the thickness of the dentin. The results of earlier studies have indicated a direct growth-promoting effect of the sex chromosomes on tooth growth, and that the effect of X and Y chromosomes is different. The present results suggest that the influence of the X- and Y-chromosome gene(s) on amelogenesis is the same in quantitative terms but different in relation to the determination of the distance between dentino-enamel junctions; the Y chromosome is more effective than the X chromosome in that respect. It is postulated that this size-increasing effect of the Y-chromosome gene(s) might result from its profound effect on cell proliferations...|$|R
30|$|Specimen 111038 {{depicted}} in {{the lower half of}} Fig.  4 clearly exhibits a carious lesion in its center. In the images, the hard tissues, enamel and dentin, can be clearly distinguished. Hunter–Schreger bands [49], which arise due to the decussation of neighboring bundles of enamel crystallites and run from the DEJ {{to the surface of the}} tooth, are identified as horizontal stripes in specimen 100818 image (a) on the left side in enamel. These bands are also visible as alternating stripes of higher and lower orientation in image (g) on the right side in enamel. Striae of Retzius [50] are visible in image (a) in the upper right part of the tooth slice as horizontal parallel lines to the enamel dentin boarder. These lines result from the deposition of layers of different calcification during tooth formation. In dentin, Ebner lines [51], also known as growth lines, which indicate the daily rate of dentin formation, and dentin tubules, micrometer-thin canals which contain the long cytoplasmatic processes of odontoblasts and extend circularly from the pulp to the <b>dentino-enamel</b> and dentino-cemental <b>junctions,</b> are identified.|$|R
50|$|Unlike enamel, dentine may be demineralized {{and stained}} for {{histological}} study. Dentine consists of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentine from the pulp to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The dentinal tubules extend from the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) in the crown area, or dentinocemental junction (DCJ) in the root area, {{to the outer}} wall of the pulp. From the outer surface of the dentine to the area nearest the pulp, these tubules follow an S-shaped path. The diameter and density of the tubules are greatest near the pulp. Tapering from the inner to the outermost surface, they have a diameter of 2.5 μm near the pulp, 1.2 μm {{in the middle of the}} dentin, and 0.9 μm at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Their density is 59,000 to 76,000 per square millimeter near the pulp, whereas the density is only half as much near the enamel. Within the tubules, there is an odontoblast process, which is an extension of an odontoblast, and dentinal fluid, which contains a mixture of albumin, transferrin, tenascin and proteoglycans. In addition, there are branching canalicular systems that connect to each other. These branches have been categorized by size, with major being 500-1000 nm in diameter, fine being 300-700 nm, and micro being less than 300 nm. The major branches are the terminal ends of the tubules. About every 1-2 μm, there are fine branches diverging from dentinal tubules at 45 degree angles. The microtubules diverge at 90 degree angles. The dentinal tubules contain the cytoplasmic extensions of odontoblasts that once formed the dentin and maintain it. The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are aligned along the inner aspect of dentin against a layer of predentin where they also form the peripheral boundary of the dental pulp. Because of dentinal tubules, dentin has a degree of permeability, which can increase the sensation of pain and the rate of tooth decay. The strongest held theory of dentinal hypersensitivity suggests that it is due to changes in the dentinal fluid associated with the processes, a type of hydrodynamic mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{number and}} the mean {{percentage}} tubular cross-sectional area of dentinal tubules per square millimetre were calculated in specimens of coronal dentine of 13 intact human third molar teeth from patients 18 to 28 years of age. The dentine was fractured at various known distances from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Near the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> the number of tubules per square millimetre was 22 000 and the mean tubular cross-sectional area was 3. 6 %. Midway between the pulpal wall and the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> the number of tubules was 37 000 mm- 2 and the mean tubular cross-sectional area was 6. 2 %. Close to the pulp the number of dentinal tubules was 48 000 mm- 2 and the mean cross sectional area of tubules was 10. 2 percent. The number of tubules per square millimetre more than doubled and the area occupied by tubules increased threefold from the dentine close to the dentine-enamel junction, to that close to the pulp. These differences in tubular patterns at different depths in dentine are clinically significant in dentine permeability, the treatment of traumatized teeth, and pain transmission in dentine...|$|E
40|$|IT IS {{well known}} that the {{establishment}} of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> by the juxta-alignment of the inner enamel epithelium and the subjacent mesenchy-mal cells provides the anlage for the future morphologic characteristics of the completed tooth. How closely the completed enamel crown, particularly its occlusal surface, mirrors the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (which will now be re-garded as the surface of the dentin "crown") is not known. Nor has the metrical cusp-to-cusp correspondence of enamel to dentin surfaces been studied. The latter obviously must be a function of growth rate. A uniformity of topical and metrical relationships between the enamel and dentin surfaces bespeaks a uniform pattern and rate of enamel deposition in the growing tooth. Thus far it has been more or less tacitly assumed that there is complete cor-respondence between the two surfaces.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on human and Rhesus monkey enamel using three {{methods of analysis}} to gain information concerning the pattern of enamel calcification: (1) microhardness pattern of enamel mineralization; (2) microradiography; and (3) plastic substitution studies. Halves of teeth were selected and tested on a Tukon Microhardness Tester with a Knoop Diamond Indentor. The other half of each tooth was further sectioned. Several sections from each tooth were ground to less than 150 [mu] in thickness and microradiographs were taken; the remainder {{were used for the}} substitution studies. All organic tissue and water were removed from the sections and replaced with plastic. Decalcification of these sections revealed areas of low and high organic and water content. It was found that mineralization of the enamel matrix begins at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> and proceeds peripherally, thus following the incremental pattern of formation of the enamel matrix. Final calcification is completed after the matrix is completely deposited and follows this same pattern from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> peripherally. The enamel rod matrix becomes calcified before the interrod substance, the latter thus presenting pathways for diffusion of tissue fluid containing calcium and phosphate ions, during the mineralization process. The interrod substance is the first area of enamel to be altered in dental caries. Thus the steps in enamel destruction are in reverse order to those in enamel formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} enamel matrix contains mostly amelogenins, {{which are}} hydrophobic proline-rich proteins.

In the present study an antibody specific for the matrix metalloproteinase collagenase activator protein (CAP) was characterized and used to identify this metalloproteinase in enamel. Immunoblotting showed that the CAP proteinase was present in the enamel matrix.

40|$|UnrestrictedUnlike {{many aspects}} of the body, human teeth do not have natural {{regenerative}} mechanisms. Instead, the multiple tissues and mechanical structures in teeth combine to create a structural gradient that successfully absorbs a lifetime of impact forces from routine mastication without irreversible damage. The integration of hard and soft tissue types is advantageous for distributing loads but the resulting interfaces are prone to fracture. The intermediate boundary known as the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (DEJ) is a natural strategy which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties. The DEJ is a self-assembling structure which combines two dissimilar materials, enamel, and dentin.

40|$|In {{the human}} {{biological}} system, the individual cells divide and form tissues and organs. These tissues are hetero-cellular. Basically any tissue {{consists of an}} epithelium and the connective tissue. The latter contains mainly mesenchymally-derived tissues with a diversified cell population.

40|$|During eating, {{the teeth}} usually endure the sharply {{temperature}} changes because of different foods. It is {{of importance to}} investigate the heat transfer and heat dissipation behavior of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (DEJ) of human tooth since dentine and enamel have different thermophysical properties. The spatial and temporal temperature distributions on the enamel, dentine, and pulpal chamber of both the human tooth and its discontinuous boundaries, were measured using infrared thermography using a stepped temperature increase on the outer boundary of enamel crowns. The thermal diffusivities for enamel and dentine were deduced from the time dependent temperature change at the enamel and dentine layers. The thermal conductivities for enamel and dentine were calculated to be 0. 81 Wm- 1 K- 1 and 0. 48 Wm- 1 K- 1 respectively. The observed temperature discontinuities across the interfaces between enamel, dentine and pulp-chamber layers were due to the difference of thermal conductivities at interfaces {{rather than to the}} phase transformation. The temperature gradient distributes continuously across the enamel and dentine layers and their junction below a temperature of 42 °C, whilst a negative thermal resistance is observed at interfaces above 42 °C.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{number of}} {{publications}} on the oral features in Apert syndrome is limited. The present study investigated dental tissues in Apert syndrome histologically, {{to determine the}} nature and extent of anomalies, to provide some insight into the nature of the condition, and to explain how observed anomalies may affect the dental management of individuals with Apert syndrome. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Extracted primary and secondary teeth were collected from patients with Apert who had attended the Australian Craniofacial Unit, Adelaide, South Australia. The total study sample comprised 13 individuals, aged from 14 to 21, with nine men and four women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 teeth were available for histological examination (the number belonging to each individual varied from 2 to 5 per patient). The teeth were sectioned longitudinally, and one-half of each tooth underwent decalcification. Sections were stained with H&E for routine histological examination. Ground sections were prepared from undecalcified tooth halves. RESULTS: Histological assessment of the dental hard tissues revealed an intact enamel and dentinal structure but some irregularities were noted in the region of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (DEJ), which could affect caries progression and also make dental management more difficult. CONCLUSION: This study identified histological anomalies of the DEJ of Apert syndrome teeth. An improved appreciation of {{the nature and extent}} of dental anomalies in Apert syndrome should assist clinicians when undertaking management of affected individuals. T. L. Surman, R. M. Logan, G.

Oral examination was performed according to the evidence of carious and gingival lesions. Decayed or filled teeth (dft) index for primary teeth, and the decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index for permanent teeth was assessed. All patients with a history of spontaneous dental abscesses underwent orthopantomography examination. RESULTS: d/D ranged from 0 to 9 and f/F from 0 to 3. DMFT/dft index was 0 in the three youngest patients. One patient had enamel hypoplasia and two had enamel dyschromic alterations. Six out of nine patients (67 %) had a history of spontaneous fistulae as a consequence of periapical abscesses occurring in the absence of dental decay or history of injury. In these patients, orthopantomographies showed enlarged pulp chambers associated with prominent pulp horns extending up to the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> in both primary and permanent dentition.

40|$|Tooth {{development}} is regulated {{by a series}} of reciprocal inductive signaling between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme, which culminates with the formation of dentin and enamel. EMMPRIN/CD 147 is an Extracellular Matrix Metallo. PRoteinase (MMP) INducer that mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in cancer and other pathological processes and is expressed in developing teeth. Here we used EMMPRIN knockout (KO) mice to determine the functional role of EMMPRIN on dental tissue formation. We report a delay in enamel deposition and formation that is clearly distinguishable in the growing incisor and associated with a significant reduction of MMP- 3 and MMP- 20 expression in tooth germs of KO mice. Insufficient basement membrane degradation is evidenced by a persistent laminin immunostaining, resulting in a delay of both odontoblast and ameloblast differentiation. Consequently, enamel volume and thickness are decreased in adult mutant teeth but enamel maturation and to oth morphology are normal, as shown by micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT), nanoindentation, and scanning electron microscope analyses. In addition, the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> appears as a rough calcified layer of approximately 10 ± 5. m thick (mean ± SD) in both molars and growing incisors of KO adult mice. These results indicate that EMMPRIN is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk during tooth development by regulating the expression of MMPs. The mild tooth phenotype observed in EMMPRIN KO mice suggests that the direct effect of EMMPRIN may be limited to a short time window, comprised between basement membrane degradation allowing direct cell contact and calcified matrix deposition...|$|E
40|$|Kallikrein 4 (Klk 4) is {{believed}} to play {{an essential role in}} enamel biomineralization, because defects in KLK 4 cause hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta. We used gene targeting to generate a knockin mouse that replaces the Klk 4 gene sequence, starting at the translation initiation site, with a lacZ reporter gene. Correct targeting of the transgene was confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analyses. Histochemical X-gal (5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) staining demonstrated expression of β-galactosidase in maturation stage ameloblasts. No X-gal staining was observed in secretory stage ameloblasts or in odontoblasts. Retained enamel proteins were observed in the maturation stage enamel of the Klk 4 null mouse, but not in the Klk 4 heterozygous or wild-type mice. The enamel layer in the Klk 4 null mouse was normal in thickness and contained decussating enamel rods but was rapidly abraded following weaning, despite the mice being maintained on soft chow. In function the enamel readily fractured within the initial rod and interrod enamel above the parallel enamel covering the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Despite the lack of Klk 4 and the retention of enamel proteins, significant levels of crystal maturation occurred (although delayed), and the enamel achieved a mineral density in some places greater than that detected in bone and dentin. An important finding was that individual enamel crystallites of erupted teeth failed to grow together, interlock, and function as a unit. Instead, individual crystallites seemed to spill out of the enamel when fractured. These results demonstrate that Klk 4 is essential for the removal of enamel proteins and the proper maturation of enamel crystals...|$|E
40|$|NoThe {{ability of}} prisms to {{effectively}} dissipate contact stress {{at the surface}} will influence wear rates in teeth. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to begin to quantify the effect of prism orientation on surface stresses. Seven finite element models of enamel microstructure were created, each model differing in the angulation of prism orientation with regard to the wear surface. For validation purposes, the mechanical behavior of the model was compared with published experimental data. In order to test the enamel under lateral loads, a compressed food particle was dragged across the surface from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (DEJ) towards the outer enamel surface (OES). Under these conditions, tensile stresses in the enamel model increased with increases in the coefficient of friction. More importantly, stresses were found to be lowest in models in which the prisms approach the surface at lower angles (i. e., more obliquely cut prisms), and highest when the prisms approached the surface at 60 ° (i. e., less obliquely cut). Finally, the direction of travel of the simulated food particle was reversed, allowing comparison of the difference in behavior between trailing and leading edge enamels (i. e., when the food particle was dragged either towards or away from the DEJ). Stresses at the trailing edge were usually lower than stresses at the leading edge. Taken together with what is known about prism orientation in primate teeth, such findings imply greater wear resistance at the intercuspal region and less wear resistance at the lateral enamel at midcrown. Such findings appear to be supported by archeological evidence...|$|E

AFM-based nanoindentation and Raman microspectroscopy were used to define the width and composition of human molar DEJ. Indentation elastic modulus and hardness of enamel, dentin, and DEJ were determined along lines of indents made at 2 μm intervals across the DEJ. Indents made at maximum loads {{at each end of}} the indent lines were used to make visible markers allowing Raman microspectroscopy at 1 μm intervals across the DEJ, while using the nanoindent markers for orientation and location. Functional DEJ width estimates were made based on results from nanoindentation and Raman microspectroscopy. DEJ width estimates ranged from 4. 7 (± 1. 2) μm to 6. 1 (± 1. 9) μm based on hardness and 4. 9 (± 1. 1) μm to 6. 9 (± 1. 9) μm basedonmodulus.

Aim and Objectives: This study investigated microleakage of three different bases under composite resin in sandwich technique using dye penetration and dentin surface interface using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials and Methods: Sixty extracted deciduous molars were stored in distilled water and Class I cavities with a width of about one-fourth of intercuspal distance and a depth of 0. 5 - 1 mm below the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> was prepared without bevels. In Group 1 - glass ionomer cement (GIC); Group 2 - mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA); Group 3 - Biodentine™ was placed as a base under composite. Teeth were longitudinally sectioned in two halves, through the centers of the restoration, immersed in 2 % methylene blue and microleakage was evaluated under stereomicroscope and surface interface between base and dentin was evaluated under SEM. Results:Under the condition of in vitro study, less microleakage and less internal gaps were seen in Biodentine™ (0. 00 ± 0. 00 and 4. 00 ± 1. 59) group than MTA (0. 00 ± 0. 00 and 6. 08 ± 1. 82) and GIC (25. 25 ± 6. 57 and 14. 73 ± 3. 72, respectively) and showed very strong positive correlation between microleakage and internal gaps. Conclusion: Biodentine™ exhibits superior marginal sealing ability as well as marginal adaptation under composite resin as compared to MTA and GIC...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} bleaching tetracycline-stained teeth by measuring the loss of fluorescent intensity from teeth that were bleached. Nineteen male New Zealand white rabbits, with 58 incisors stained with oxytetracycline and 16 incisors as unstained controls, were used. Three rabbits were sacrificed {{to determine whether the}} tetracycline stain was comparable between incisors in the same jaw. Of the remaining 16 animals, 6 were bleached once and 10 were bleached twice. One maxillary and one mandibular incisor were bleached in each jaw with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide and heat for ten minutes per tooth; the other incisors were protected with a rubber dam. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last bleach. The fluorescent intensity of 374 select ground sections 100 ± 5 microns thick from the incisal, middle and gingival thirds of the teeth were measured with an ultraviolet light microscope coupled to a television electronic measurement system. These measurements were statistically analyzed by t-test, and observations correlated. The dentin of tetracycline-stained maxillary incisors which were bleached twice and the dentin in the incisal one-third of the mandibular incisors which were bleached twice had a significantly (P ≤ 0. 001, P ≤ 0. 005) lower tetracycline fluorescent intensity than the dentin of unbleached tetracycline-stained teeth. The greatest loss of fluorescent intensity of tetracycline occurred in dentin closest to the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> and varied from about 150 to 350 microns from the outer enamel surface. Clinical Kodachromes indicate that the loss of tetracycline pigment is associated with the loss of tetracycline fluorescence; The ground sections showed that the tetracycline fluorescence was never totally removed by two bleaches...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective:FAM 20 A gene {{mutations}} {{result in}} enamel renal syndrome (ERS) associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), nephrocalcinosis, gingival fibromatosis, and impaired tooth eruption. FAM 20 A would control the phosphorylation of enamel peptides and thus enamel mineralization. Here, we characterized {{the structure and}} chemical composition of unerupted tooth enamel from ERS patients and healthy subjects. Methods: Tooth sections were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Results: SEM revealed that prisms were restricted to the inner-most enamel zones. The bulk of the mineralized matter covering the crown was formed by layers with varying electron-densities organized into lamellae and micronodules. Tissue porosity progressively increased at the periphery, ending with loose and unfused nanonodules also observed in the adjoining soft tissues. Thus, the enamel layer covering the dentin in all ERS patients (except a limited layer of enamel at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction)</b> displayed an ultrastructural globular pattern similar to one observed in ectopic mineralization of soft tissue, notably in the gingiva of Fam 20 a knockout mice. XRD analysis confirmed the existence of alterations in crystallinity and composition (vs. sound enamel). XRF identified lower levels of calcium and phosphorus in ERS enamel. Finally, EDS confirmed the reduced amount of calcium in ERS enamel, which appeared similar to dentin. Conclusion: This study suggests that, after an initial normal start to amelogenesis, {{the bulk of the}} tissue covering coronal dentin would be formed by different mechanisms based on nano- to micro-nodule aggregation. This evocated ectopic mineralization process is known to intervene in several soft tissues in FAM 20 A gene mutant...|$|E
40|$|The <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (DEJ) connects enamel, {{that covers}} the outer surface of a tooth, to a thicker {{underlying}} dentin. The DEJ is a critical interface that permits joining these materials that have widely dissimilar mechanical properties. AFM-based nanoindentation and Raman microspectroscopy were used to define the width and composition of human molar DEJ. Indentation elastic modulus and hardness of enamel, dentin, and DEJ were determined along lines of indents made at 2 &#x 2009;&#x 03 BC;m intervals across the DEJ. Indents made at maximum loads {{at each end of}} the indent lines were used to make visible markers allowing Raman microspectroscopy at 1 &#x 2009;&#x 03 BC;m intervals across the DEJ, while using the nanoindent markers for orientation and location. Functional DEJ width estimates were made based on results from nanoindentation and Raman microspectroscopy. DEJ width estimates ranged from 4. 7 (&#x 00 B 1; 1. 2) &#x 03 BC;m to 6. 1 (&#x 00 B 1; 1. 9) &#x 03 BC;m based on hardness and 4. 9 (&#x 00 B 1; 1. 1) &#x 03 BC;m to 6. 9 (&#x 00 B 1; 1. 9) &#x 03 BC;m based on modulus. DEJ width based on Raman peak intensity variations were 8. 0 (&#x 00 B 1; 3. 2) &#x 03 BC;m to 8. 5 (&#x 00 B 1; 3. 1) &#x 03 BC;m based on the phosphate peak, and 7. 6 (&#x 00 B 1; 3. 2) &#x 03 BC;m to 8. 0 (&#x 00 B 1; 2. 6) &#x 03 BC;m for C&# 8211;H stretching mode. These estimates are in the range of DEJ width estimates reported using nanoindentation...|$|E

This study aimed to compare the thickness of enamel and dentine in deciduous and permanent mandibular incisor teeth between DS and non-DS individuals and to clarify how these tissues contribute to altered tooth size in DS. Sample groups comprised 61 mandibular incisors (29 permanent and 32 deciduous) from DS individuals and 55 mandibular incisors (29 permanent and 26 deciduous) from non-DS individuals. Maximum mesiodistal and labiolingual crown dimensions were measured initially, then the crowns were sectioned midsagittally and photographed using a stereomicroscope. Linear measurements of enamel and dentine thickness were obtained on the labial and lingual surfaces of the crowns, together with enamel and dentine-pulp areas and lengths of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Reduced permanent crown size in DS {{was associated with a}} reduction in both enamel and dentine thickness. After adjustments were made for tooth size, DS permanent incisors had significantly thinner enamel than non-DS permanent teeth. The DS permanent teeth also exhibited significant differences in shape and greater variability in dimensions than the non-DS permanent teeth. Crown dimensions of deciduous incisors were similar in size or larger in DS compared with non-DS deciduous teeth. Enamel and dentine thicknesses of the deciduous teeth were similar in DS and non-DS individuals. The findings indicate that growth retardation in DS reduces both enamel and dentine deposition in the permanent incisors but not in the earlier-forming deciduous predecessors. The results are also consistent with the concept of amplified developmental instability for dental traits in DS. Emma Bell, Grant Townsend, David Wilson, Jules Kieser, and Toby Hughe...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2007 Australian Dental AssociationBACKGROUND: There are {{a number}} of studies citing the primary reason for {{replacing}} auto cure glass ionomer cements was due to recurrent caries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use an in vitro model to measure caries at the dentine restoration interface of bonded composite resin and auto cure glass ionomer cement restorations and to measure the amount of surface degradation occurring in the restorative materials. METHODS: Specimens of auto cure glass ionomer cements (Riva Fast, Fuji IX Fast, Ketac Molar Quick and Fuji VII) and bonded composite resin restorations (Ice, SDI) were placed separately at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> of 10 recently extracted human third molar teeth, disinfected and placed into the overflow from a continuous culture of S. mutans for two weeks. Restorations were sectioned and prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Restoration tooth interfaces were photographed and the distance from the surface of the teeth to the surface of the restorations measured. EPMA of percentage weights of calcium, phosphorous and fluoride were made outwards from the restoration surface 130 pm at a depth of 10 microm below the surface of the dentine. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the surface heights of composite resin, auto cure glass ionomer cements compared to teeth surfaces. Percentage weights of calcium and phosphorus levels were similar to non-demineralized dentine in the auto cure glass ionomer cement samples but there were significant reductions in mineral content of dentine adjacent to bonded composite resin restorations. Fluoride levels were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that placing a bonded composite resin restoration into dentine affords little protection to the surrounding tooth from caries attack although insignificant degradation of the restorative surface occurs. Placing a glass ionomer cement restoration into dentine protects the surrounding tooth from caries but degradation of the restoration surface occurs.
