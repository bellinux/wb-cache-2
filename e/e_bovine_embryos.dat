40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of beta-mercaptoethanol (a stimulator of glutathione synthesis) and Trolox (an hydrosoluble analogue of Vitamin <b>E)</b> on <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> cultured from the morula stage (Day 5 post-insemination; pi) under oxidative stress conditions. Culture of embryos with increased doses of Trolox showed a dose-dependent embryotoxicity on Day 8 pi. The use of 400 microM Trolox as well as beta-mercaptoethanol at 100 microM prevented at least partly (P < 0. 05) the prooxidant-induced blastocyst degeneration on Day 8. Hatching rates of surviving blastocysts were significantly increased by both antioxidants and beta-mercaptoethanol alone improved their mean cell numbers, which was significant in the ICM (P < 0. 05). Analysis of their effect on Day 7 pi showed that both the antioxidants significantly reduced the prooxidant-induced apoptosis and beta-mercaptoethanol diminished the physiological level of apoptosis as well as it stimulated the glutathione synthesis (P < 0. 05). In addition, a comparison between in vitro- and in vivo-produced embryos showed that the levels of apoptosis were similar at the same age post-insemination (morulae and blastocysts) but increased steadily with the embryonic age in in vitro ones. In conclusion, beta-mercaptoethanol and Trolox added separately from the morula stage protected embryos against oxidative stress and improved the quality of the resulting blastocysts...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Early embryo {{development}} {{is dependent on}} maternally derived RNA and protein synthesized during oogenesis. In the <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> this dependence lasts until the 8 - 16 cell stage, at which time embryonic transcripts become essential for continued development. One proposed mechanism for this transition from maternal to zygotic control of development (maternal to zygotic genome activation; MZGA) is the appearance of transcription factors that activate specific genes in the embryonic genome. The E 26 transforming specific (Ets) family of transcription factors is involved in development, differentiation and protease regulation, and is a logical candidate gene {{to be involved in}} MZGA. Determining the role of Ets- 1 in early {{embryo development}} may provide useful insight into mechanisms contributing to early embryonic death and pregnancy failure. Ets- 1 transcripts were detected in bovine primary and secondary oocytes, primary and secondary cumulus oocyte complexes (COC), presumed zygotes, and 2 - to 16 -cell in vitro-derived embryos. Ets- 1 transcripts were also detected in Days 10 and 12 porcine in vivo-derived embryos. Blocking Ets- 1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited development in in vitro-derived <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos.</b> Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) production by in vivo-derived <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> was reduced with antisense oligonucleotides.

On Day 6 post-insemination, morulae were cultured for 48 h in the presence of: (1) mLIF, 100 ng ml− 1; (2) hLIF, 100 ng ml− 1; or (3) no LIF. Reduced blastocyst rates were observed on Day 8 for hLIF at the middle and expanded stages, while mLIF had no effect.

After in vitro maturation and fertilization, <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> were cultured with either 0 or 2. 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Development was evaluated and embryos were collected and fixed at different stages during development (2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 16 -cell, morula and blastocyst). Fixed embryos were then used for immunofluorescence utilizing an antibody for H 3 R 26 me 2. Images of stained embryos were analyzed as a percentage of total DNA. Embryos cultured with 2. 5 % FBS developed to blastocysts at a greater rate than 0 %FBS groups (34. 85 ± 5. 43 % vs. 23. 38 ± 2. 93 %; P< 0. 05). Levels of H 3 R 26 me 2 changed for both groups over development. In the 0 %FBS group, the greatest amount of H 3 R 26 me 2 staining was at the 4 -cell (P< 0. 05), 16 -cell (P< 0. 05) and morula (P< 0. 05) stages.

40|$|Apoptosis {{is a form}} of {{cell death}} that can {{function}} to elimi-nate cells damaged by environmental stress. One stress that can compromise embryonic development is elevated temperature (i. e., heat shock). For the current studies, we hypothesized that heat shock induces apoptosis in <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> in a develop-mentally regulated manner. Studies were performed to 1) deter-mine whether heat shock can induce apoptosis in preimplanta-tion embryos, 2) test whether heat-induced apoptosis is devel-opmentally regulated, 3) evaluate whether heat shock-induced changes in caspase activity parallel patterns of apoptosis, and 4) ascertain whether exposure to a mild heat shock can protect embryos from heat-induced apoptosis.

40|$|Blastocyst formation, as a {{critical}} period during development, is an effective indicator of embryonic health and reproductive efficiency. Out {{of a number of}} mechanisms underlying blastocyst formation, highly conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling has emerged as a major mechanism involved in regulating murine preimplantation embryo development. The objective of our study was to ascertain the role of MAPK signaling in regulating bovine development to the blastocyst stage. Using reverse transcriptase PCR and immunohistochemical staining procedures we have demonstrated that mRNA transcripts and polypeptides encoding p 38 MAPK pathway constituents are detectable in preimplantation <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> from the one-cell to the blastocyst stage. Further, the effects on <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> development following inhibition of p 38 alpha/beta and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling by treatment with SB 220025 and U 0126, respectively, were investigated. Eight-cell <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> (50 per group; three replicates) were placed into treatments consisting of synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) medium: SOF + SB 202474 (inactive analogue), SOF + SB 220025, SOF + U 0124 (inactive analogue), SOF + U 0126, and SOF + SB 220025 + U 0126. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK or ERK signaling individually did not affect development to the blastocyst stage. However, when both pathways were blocked simultaneously there was a significant reduction (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in blastocyst formation, cell number and immunofluorescence of phosphorylated downstream pathway constituents. We have determined that, in variance to what was observed during murine preimplantation development, <b>bovine</b> early <b>embryos</b> progress at normal frequencies to the blastocyst stage in the presence of p 38 MAPK inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of annexin II (Ann-II) {{during the initial}} stages of <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> development and the regulation of Ann-II expression by retinol and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were studied. <b>Bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> at different stages of development were produced in vitro on Synthetic Oviductal Fluid (SOF) medium (control group), SOF supplemented with retinol (retinol group; 0. 1 ng/ml), or IGF-I (IGF-I group; 10 ng/ml). The embryos were processed for mRNA extraction, cDNA production and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Ann-II-specific oligonucleotides. Ann-II was detected in all stages of early embryo development, except for the 16 -cell stage. The blastocyst rates were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in the group supplemented with retinol (37. 8 %, 45 / 119) during in vitro embryo culture (IVC) than in those cultured in SOF (20. 5 %, 24 / 117) or SOF with IGF-I (25. 8 %, 24 / 93). Semiquantitative analysis of Ann-II expression in embryos produced in medium supplemented with IGF-I or retinol revealed a lower expression of this gene when compared with embryos cultured in SOF (P< 0. 05). The Ann-II expression was not different in embryos cultured in the {{presence of}} retinol and IGF-I.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to define the effects of various growth-promoting factors on in vitro embryonic development of in vitro matured and in vitro fertilized <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos.</b> The control medium was a chemically defined medium which improves the possibility of closely determining the in vivo conditions the embryo is actually exposed to. The growth-promoting factors tested in this experiment included transferrin, IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-one), IGF-II (insulin-like growth factor-two), TGF-a (transforming growth factor-alpha), TGF-B 1 (transforming growth factor-beta 1), PDGF (platelet derived growth factor), EGF (epidermal growth factor), NGF (nerve growth factor), and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor). Transferrin was included at 10 micrograms/milliliter, while all other factors were utilized at 10 nanograms/milliliter in the control medium. Bovine cumulus-oocytes were retrieved from slaughterhouse ovaries and were matured i n Medium- 199 containing 10 % feta l bovine serum for 24 hours at 39 °C in a 5 % C 02 atmosphere. Frozen-thawed bull spe r m were s wim-up separated and capacitated in medium containing heparin for 3 hours prior to insemination. Gametes were co- incubated fo r 18 hours and then cumulus cells were stripped from the ova. Ova which did not cleave were removed from culture 36 hours after insemi nati on and were stained for evidence of fertilization. Embryos were cultured in one of the 10 conditions (including control) described above. A total of 150 total oocy. t. es were cultured per treatment for a tota l of 10 days. EGF improved embryo development, while TGF-Bl and TGF-a only slightly improved embryo development compared to the control. All other factors tested did not have a beneficial effect on embryo development in this culture medium. In summary, EGF improved in vitro development of <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> obtained from in vitro maturated and in vitro fertilized bovine oocytes.
