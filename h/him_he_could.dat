5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
5|$|Mubarak's top aides, {{family and}} son Gamal told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{ride out the}} turmoil, which {{convinced}} him to cling to power. It was also reported that one son, Alaa, accused his younger brother Gamal of ruining their father's reputation. Eyewitnesses said that the Egyptian army had pulled out troops from many locations near the presidential palace.|$|E

5|$|On the {{division}} left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted to withdraw. The regimental commander, told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{not do so}} until the 7th Cavalry had cleared on its withdrawal road. This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|After John Sigismund died in 1571, the Diet of Transylvania elected Stephen Báthory voivode (or ruler) in 1571. Stephen {{adopted the}} title of prince of Transylvania after he was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania in 1575. The childless king decided {{to take charge of}} his nephew's {{education}} and ordered him to come to Poland in late 1578. Andrew studied at the Jesuit college in Pułtusk. His fellow-students were mainly young Protestant noblemen from Transylvania or Royal Hungary, but Polish, Lithuanian, German and Italian noblemen and commoners were also chosen to study together with <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> speak Latin, Italian, Polish and German {{by the end of his}} studies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E

5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not attack, that {{there were too many}} {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon <b>him,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not attack, that {{there were too many}} {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

50|$|V4 is {{a former}} biker who got {{severely}} injured in a motorcycle accident. Dr. Minimizer stuck parts of his destroyed motorcycle inside <b>him</b> so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stay alive, then <b>he</b> shrank <b>him</b> so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> compete in races. He wears a leather biking suit with a zip over his mouth and an engine on his back. His attacks are Plasma Punch and Energy Trail.|$|R

25|$|On September 17, 2008, Siaki {{retired from}} {{professional}} wrestling because {{he planned to}} donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother, Bernard. Siaki would only have one kidney remaining, and thus the doctor told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not wrestle anymore, effectively ending his ten-year career.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2010, it was {{announced}} Cannavaro would move to UAE League side Al-Ahli on a free transfer after the 2010 World Cup. Cannavaro signed a two-year deal. He made 16 appearances for the Dubai club, scoring two goals. Cannavaro announced his retirement from football in July 2011 due to a serious knee problem; doctors had told <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer play.|$|E

25|$|Once in office, High began {{tackling}} corruption. With {{most of the}} City Commissioners opposing <b>him,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{do little}} as mayor, but he began pushing to publicize problems. He visited strip clubs {{in the company of}} a reporter, leading to a series of reports of how the bars were cheating customers. He dressed in old clothes and, again accompanied by a reporter, bought bolita (an illegal lottery) tickets on the street.|$|E
25|$|Williams demanded loyalty {{from those}} around <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not forgive the fickle {{nature of the}} fans— booing a player for booting a ground ball, then turning around and roaring {{approval}} of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed at him in Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgement after a home run.|$|E
25|$|DeStefano {{would give}} his loan shark victims presents, {{such as a}} gold watch with his name {{engraved}} on the back, so {{that if he had}} to kill his victim and the police accused <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use the watch as proof of how close he was to the victim and why he could never have killed him. He wore thick black rimmed glasses, making people believe he couldn't see without them, when in truth he could see everything that was going on and would take mental notes on how people operated.|$|E
50|$|A hard test crash, April of 1970, {{at the old}} Texas World Speedway Texas left <b>him</b> disoriented. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not {{remember}} fellow driver Cale Yarborough picking him up in Texas {{a few days later}} and flying <b>him</b> home. <b>He</b> also <b>could</b> {{not remember}} flying on to Martinsville, or running in the race at Martinsville.|$|R

25|$|His parents {{divorced}} when Goddard {{was seven years}} old and his mother supported him by working as a domestic cleaner, briefly working for Paul McCartney. Goddard's first school was Robinsfield Infants School, where he created a considerable stir by throwing a brick through the head-teacher's office window on two consecutive days. In the aftermath of this incident, Goddard was placed under the supervision of teacher Joanna Saloman, who encouraged him to develop his abilities in art and whom he would later credit as the first person to show <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be creative artistically.|$|E
25|$|Hugh allied {{himself with}} the Muslim city of Ascalon, {{and was able to}} hold off the army set against <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not {{maintain}} his position indefinitely, however. His alliance with Ascalon cost him support at court. The Patriarch negotiated lenient terms for peace, and Hugh was exiled for three years. Soon thereafter an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Hugh was attributed to Fulk or his supporters. This was reason enough for the queen's party to openly challenge Fulk, as Fulk's unfounded assertions of infidelity were a public affront that would damage Melisende's position entirely.|$|E
25|$|Laurents wrote {{a lengthy}} {{treatment}} for Ray Stark, who read it on a transcontinental flight {{and called the}} screenwriter the moment he arrived in Los Angeles to greenlight the project. Laurents had been impressed with They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and suggested Sydney Pollack direct. Streisand was impressed that he had studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan and seconded the choice. Stark was less enthused, but agreed because Pollack assured <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> deliver Robert Redford {{for the role of}} Hubbell, which Laurents had written with Ryan O'Neal in mind. O'Neal's affair with Streisand was at its end, and Stark wanted to avoid conflicts between the leads.|$|E
50|$|Thackeray meets Charlotte and {{introduces}} her to London society. She convinces him to {{take her}} to the poverty-stricken East End, where Arthur now works. Arthur admits to Charlotte that he loves her, but because Emily loved <b>him,</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not stay in Yorkshire.|$|R
