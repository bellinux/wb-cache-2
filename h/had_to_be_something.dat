500|$|It was {{the final}} scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{impressive}} in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, [...] "I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film." [...] This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, {{played a pivotal role}} in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a naïve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices.|$|E

The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> so offensive. And we decided to hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario." [...] Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response {{to what he had}} learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, there <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E

[...] "I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something {{we really wanted to}} do, and that is why you never saw DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM," [...] stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. [...] The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac-Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. [...] Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. [...] He stated the goal was to ensure that the game [...] "stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail [...] "sequels" [...] can be a lot of the time." [...] The game runs on Twisted Pixel's BEARD engine, which has been used to power all of their titles.|$|E

It was a big field sprinkled profusely with white sheep. A trodden path crossed it diagonally. After she had gone more than half-way she turned her head for the first time. Keeping five feet or so behind, Captain Anthony was following her with an air of extreme interest. Interest or eagerness. At any rate she caught an expression on his face which frightened her.

5000|$|The {{headmaster}} {{should have}} been reprimanded for such actions. But in the epilogue, we find that Headmaster Kobayashi had good connections with leaders in government.
