5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} that our new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is an intriguing idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{where you want it}} on the vessel.|$|E

The name could be used as an insult towards the fairy in question, but it could also rather contradictorily be used to grant powers and gifts to the user.|$|E

You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the stealth bomber? What you need is red mercury.|$|E

500|$|In {{his opening}} scene, Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish, a {{language}} {{he had picked}} up during his boyhood in New York City. Critics praised the film. Taxi! {{was the source of}} one of Cagney's most misquoted lines; he never actually said, [...] "MMMmmm, you dirty rat!", a line commonly used by impressionists. The closest he got to it in the film was, [...] "Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> through the door!" [...] The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of critics {{concluded that the}} episode was disconsolate. E! Online Kristin dos Santos called the installment [...] "gut-wrenching", saying it {{was the type of}} episode that [...] "rips out your heart and feeds <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with a spoon". Ann Oldenburg of USA Today summarized that the episode required viewers to [...] "reach for the Kleenex". TV Guide Natalie Abrams called the episode [...] "heartbreaking", and praised the performances by Dempsey and Ramirez for their realism. Writing for Newsday, Verne Gay called Sloan's death scene [...] "touching", and opined that the show will be different without the character's presence.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} a New York Times Best Seller and was praised by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it [...] "eviscerates a basic assumption: that slavery in America ended with the Civil War." [...] She praised the book's {{evidence}} as [...] "relentless and fascinating," [...] although she thought that the conceit of reconstructing Cottenham's life gives the book [...] "a shaky start". Leonard Pitts, {{a columnist for the}} Miami Herald, wrote that [...] "Slavery by Another Name is an astonishing book. It will challenge and change your understanding of what we were as Americans - and of what we are. I cannot recommend <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> highly enough." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1920, {{at the age}} of 20, Coward {{starred in}} his own play, the light comedy I'll Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>You.</b> After a tryout in Manchester, it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in 2006), his first {{full-length}} play in the West End. Neville Cardus's praise in The Manchester Guardian was grudging. Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. The Observer commented, [...] "Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days." [...] The Times, on the other hand, was enthusiastic: [...] "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head – spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'." ...|$|E
500|$|The generally-accepted {{explanation}} of the state's name {{is that it is}} derived from the Sarawak Malay word serawak, which means antimony. A popular alternative explanation {{is that it is a}} contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the Sultan of Brunei), [...] "Saya serah pada awak" [...] (I surrender <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you),</b> when he gave Sarawak to James Brooke, an English explorer in 1841. James Brooke later became the first of the White Rajah dynasty to govern Sarawak. However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word awak was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ground}} was finally cleared Gregory insisted, {{according}} to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, [...] "Then the game is at an end". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied [...] "I will give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in two minutes if the batsmen don't return". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions. When Barton came out he announced that Alick Bannerman and Nat Thomson would resume the NSW innings. They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps, but before they could receive a ball, the crowd again invaded the pitch, and remained there until the scheduled end of play. According to The Sydney Mail approximately 90 minutes' play had been lost. Lord Harris maintained {{his position on the}} ground, standing [...] "erect" [...] with [...] "moustache bristling" [...] among the spectators, fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to myself. If I have to go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the idea}} for the film came while at the Marina Beach, the opening {{sequence}} song [...] "Enna Parvai" [...] picturised on Muthuraman and Kanchana was filmed on the beach promenade with the University of Madras and Presidency College in the background. In the first scene of the film, Sridhar attempted to depict Chennai as a [...] "progressive place: where couples sang duets on the Marina". Most of the film was shot in Ooty. Filming also took place on location at the Aaliyar Guest House, a bungalow near Aaliyar Dam, Coimbatore. During filming, Gopu gave Ravichandran the lyrics of the song [...] "Naalaam Naalaam", which were written like tongue-twisters in chaste Tamil. He claimed they were his own lines and asked him to memorise them. When the director called for the shots, Ravichandran asked for more time because he found it difficult to remember the dialogue. The puzzled director then said, [...] "This isn’t the dialogue. Who gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> This is a social film, a comedy. Gopu must have done it. He’s always pulling a fast one, don’t you know?" [...] During the 50th anniversary of the film in 2014, Rajasree said she had difficulties in providing the right pronunciation of her dialogues for the film.|$|E
500|$|The fourth error, {{according}} to Peter the Venerable, {{was that the}} Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, [...] rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone {{the doctrine of the}} real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation. “They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so {{in the office of the}} altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ, and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for the salvation of your souls.'" [...] The term [...] "transubstantiation", used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. In less than two centuries, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.|$|E

[...] "Gold Digger" [...] charted at number 59 in Australia, [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 38 in Australia, 73 in Canada and 46 in America, and [...] "Push It" [...] at number 60 in Australia. [...] "Gold Digger" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] are {{included on the}} album , with a studio recording of [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] included as a bonus track on discs purchased from iTunes. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered {{for use in the}} episode at a reduced licensing rate, something which surprised Murphy, who believed {{he would not be able}} to secure the rights to the song. He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising things about this experience, that these people that the cast and we really admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 9, 1961, Cooper {{attended}} a dinner given {{in his honor}} at the Friars Club hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Attended by many of his industry friends, the dinner concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, [...] "The only achievement I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community." [...] In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together. Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time. On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, [...] "We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too." [...] On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar. Speaking to Cooper, an emotional Stewart said, [...] "Coop, I {{want you to know}} I'll get <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> right away. With it goes all the friendship and affection and the admiration and deep respect of all of us. We're very, very proud of you, Coop." [...] The following day, newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying. In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, and a telephone call from President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
