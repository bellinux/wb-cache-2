The estimated seasonal <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> Mictyris by the godwits was 88 % of the initial standing stock.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{situation in}} the fisheries sector in many {{countries of the world}} can be briefly stated as (1) insufficient information on fish resources, (2) diminishing stock and (3) conflicting uses of coastal areas and types of fishing. Since there is free accessibility to the exploitable resources in the sea, the natural tendency is to make more and more without regard to the real availability. The need for fishery management assumed importance in recent years on account of the uncontrolled, or rather reckless, exploitation of the resources in many countries [leading to <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock.</b> Although according to available information the level of exploitation of the fishery resources in our country in general is far below the optimum level, there seems to be too much concentration in, certain areas and in respect to certain specks which perhaps {{is a reflection of the}} lack of fishery management policies or their implementation...|$|R
40|$|Annex 6 The highest {{catches of}} the Iberian sardine stock {{are taken from}} the {{southern}} part of Galician waters (NW corner of the Iberian Peninsula) and northern Portugal. Landings are mainly composed of younger fish, which reflects the proximity of the main recruitment area to the fishery grounds.

In the last decade a consecutive years with poor recruitments result in a <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> below limits previously recorded. The recruitment processes seem to be driven by oceanographic (local) and climatic (global) events, this dependence on both phenomena may explain the fluctuations on the landings in the sardine fisheries in Atlantic Iberian waters. Given the dependence of the fishery in this area on the strength of the recruitment, different relationship between biotic components (spawning stock size, recruitment, landings and recruitment landings) and abiotic: climatic indices (NAO-winter, Gulf Stream and AMO) and local oceanographic coastal events (upwelling and poleward current) were analysed.
