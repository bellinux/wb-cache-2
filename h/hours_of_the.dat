5000|$|<b>The</b> {{significance}} <b>of</b> performing Ushitora Gongyo at {{this time}} of day derives from earlier Buddhist teachings that describe <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ox as [...] "the end of darkness" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger as [...] "the beginning of light," [...] and ones that describe all Buddhas as having attained enlightenment {{at this time}}. The passage from <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ox to <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger therefore symbolizes the transition from <b>the</b> unenlightened condition <b>of</b> a common mortal to <b>the</b> enlightened condition <b>of</b> a Buddha, so <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> gongyo at this hour serves as a reminder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true purpose <b>of</b> Buddhist practice: to achieve enlightenment in this lifetime.|$|R

50|$|In Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, <b>the</b> {{traditional}} system <b>of</b> noting <b>hours</b> is <b>the</b> six-hour clock. This reckons each of a day's 24 hours {{apart from}} noon {{as part of}} a fourth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. 7 am was <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> daytime; 1 pm <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter half <b>of</b> daytime; 7 pm <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> nighttime; and 1 am <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter half <b>of</b> nighttime. This system existed in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, deriving its current phrasing from <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> publicly announcing <b>the</b> daytime hours with a gong and the nighttime hours with a drum. It was abolished in Laos and Cambodia during their French occupation and is uncommon there now. The Thai system remains in informal use in the form codified in 1901 by King Chulalongkorn.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 15 November the ship was tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Nečujam cove, where the vessel was beached to prevent her from sinking.
