5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} takes a phenomenological {{approach}} to investigating the role <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{in a sample}} of persons diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The role <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD has been frequently noted in the literature, although infrequently studied as a significant factor in its own right. Typically, those studying OCD have found positive correlations between questionnaire measures <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and self-reported symptoms of the disorder. Those working with sufferers have also found that OC clients in therapy report feelings <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> with respect to their symptoms, although the particular phenomenology of the relationship between guilt and symptoms is not especially clear in the clinical literature. The present work investigates in a qualitative way, the meaning <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for those with OCD. The presumed role <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD is examined in a descriptive fashion, with an eye to developing a fuller, more complete understanding of the relationship between feelings <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and OC symptoms {{in a sample of}} sufferers. Nine participants (N= 9) were recruited, and were interviewed using an unstructured approach. In terms of analysis, emphasis was placed on understanding the experience <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and OC symptoms as both were lived by sufferers, with a focus on the personal significance <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for study participants. Fifteen descriptive guilt/OCD themes were derived from interviews across the nine participants. Themes revealed the variety of connections that subjects made between feelings <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and symptoms <b>of</b> OCD. As well, the specific patterns of themes within the context of individual participants' lives were also described. The results suggest that the role <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD is highly interpersonal in nature, and that feelings <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> may precede and motivate, as well as follow and be a consequence of, the expression of OC symptoms. The particular role <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for any given sufferer may also be highly idiosyncratic. Research and clinical contributions, as well as limitations of the research, are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Capitol Hill {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most densely {{populated}} neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court hearing {{took place}} on 11 February 2008 – only {{two days before the}} series was due to premiere. The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP {{subpoena}} to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes, as well as outlines and story lines, to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10am on that date. The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes, saying they were incomplete and that the network's lawyers were closely supervising production. However, it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously. The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the <b>guilt</b> <b>of</b> the accused killer. At the hearing, which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court, Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial. Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed. The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria, but the offer was rejected by Justice King. It was initially planned that an alternative program, Underbelly: A Special Announcement, discussing {{the subject matter of the}} series, would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere. This idea was scrapped, and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead. The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision, and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> which is {{relevant}} since the appearance of philosophical knowledge, because largely forms the value system {{of the individual and}} society.

The aim of the article is the analysis of different approaches to the understanding <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> as a real phenomenon and regularity of the subsequent transition to the theoretical concept <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> The article highlights the emerging culture in epistemological, religious, ethical, ontological, metaphysical, and existential approaches to understanding the problem <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and the corresponding images <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> showing their dependence on cultural and historical conditions of human existence, can be traced the logic of their modifications in connection with change of the characteristics of spiritual culture.

40|$|BACHELOR'S THESIS - Abstract in English Filip Rut - Karl Jaspers' Conception <b>of</b> <b>Guilt</b> Abstract Origin, {{meaning and}} {{distinction}} {{of different types}} <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> are the subjects of one of Karl Jaspers' most widely read books - The Question <b>of</b> German <b>Guilt.</b> Different conception <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> {{can be found in}} his earlier texts, namely in the second volume of his Philosophy, where he places guilt among the so called boundary situations. What these conceptions have in common is the understanding a certain type <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> as a structural part of the human condition, that can not be subtracted from it. However, the relation between these two conceptions <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> is not clear and Jaspers himself does not offer any explanation.

40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is {{a significantly}} impairing anxiety disorder {{for which the}} most successful treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy, has 50 - 60 % success rates, taking into account treatment refusals and dropout rates (Fisher & Wells, 2005). Thus, {{factors that contribute to}} the persistence of OCD and interfere with treatment are likely being overlooked. Indeed, Mancini and Gangemi (2004) have proposed that individuals with OCD have greater fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> than others; that is, they dread being judged as guilty for not having done everything in their power to prevent some negative outcome. This fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> fuels obsessions and compulsions as individuals attempt to prevent, avoid, or neutralise the feared guilt. However, few studies have explored fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD, and no scales exist to measure this construct. The role <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD was therefore examined across two studies. Study 1 explored the core features <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD, as well as the validity and reliability of the Fear <b>of</b> <b>Guilt</b> Scale (FOGS), a measure developed specifically to assess levels of trait fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in OCD. Results indicate that the FOGS is a valid and reliable, two-factor measure, and greater FOGS scores significantly predict more severe OCD symptoms among nonclinical participants. Study 2 aimed to determine whether fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> evokes caution and feelings of doubt during the decision-making process, thereby making it more difficult to know when to stop and explaining perseveratory behaviour, such as compulsions in OCD. Findings suggest that greater fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> does not predict more time taken or information needed to make decisions, but higher fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> predicts feelings <b>of</b> uncertainty when deliberating, as indicated by ratings of greater difficulty making decisions, lower confidence in having made the right decisions, and less satisfaction with decisions made. Implications of these findings and the role that fear <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> may play in the development and persistence of OCD are discussed...|$|R
