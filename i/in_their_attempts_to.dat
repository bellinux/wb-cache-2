5|$|During the 2008–09 Superliga Femenina season Domínguez {{was still}} enjoying playing for L'Estartit. She {{revealed}} {{it was her}} ultimate dream to coach the Mexico women's national team. She had started coaching L'Estartit's youth teams the previous season. Difficulties with her visa and commitments with the Mexico national team eventually reduced Domínguez's playing time with UE L'Estartit. In {{the first half of}} the 2011–12 Superliga Femenina season she appeared four times. In April 2012 UE L'Estartit admitted defeat <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> bring her back to Spain.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment {{moved toward}} Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout the day, they encountered {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E

5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary. Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters, including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the Police Academy, as well as Coast Guard helicopters were mobilized to the crash site within {{half an hour of}} the crash for rescue operations, only to find there were no survivors. The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 AM EST, by which point only wreckage remained. Low tides aided search personnel <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> recover bodies from the downed aircraft. Only a few bodies remained intact.|$|E
5|$|By March 10, several South Vietnamese {{units were}} {{defeated}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> hold off the North Vietnamese; the 1st battalion of 54th Infantry Regiments of ARVN 1st Division (South Vietnam) was destroyed on Hill 224 and 273; the ARVN 47th Armoured Squadron was overrun by the VPA 1st Regiment, 324th Division, on Mount Nghe; and the ARVN 113th Regional Force Battalion conceded Pho Lai to the VPA 4th Regiment, which {{was supported by}} the 223rd Artillery Regiment. General Thi then ordered the 15th Ranger Group and the 2nd Battalion of the 54th Infantry Regiment, with support from the 27th and 37th Tank Squadrons, to mount a counter-attack on Hill 224. Over the period of one week, both sides fired over 8,000 rounds of artillery shells on Hill 224, and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted over 60 bombing sorties in an attempt to halt the advances of the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps.|$|E

5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> secure the Scottish throne.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E

5|$|On March 5 Quang sent {{one of his}} battalions to Ban Me Thuot in {{a convoy}} of 14 {{vehicles}}. They were ambushed by the North Vietnamese 9th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division at Thuan Man. Eight vehicles were destroyed, while two 150mm artillery guns were captured by the North Vietnamese. The remaining seven vehicles had to turn back, and Quang returned to Ban Me Thuot on a helicopter. On March 7 the North Vietnamese 48th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division, captured Chu Se and Thuan Man, and took 121 soldiers prisoner. On March 9 Phu ordered the 21st Ranger Battalion to fly out from Pleiku to support the 53rd Infantry Regiment {{in their efforts to}} retake Thuan Man. During the early hours of March 9, as the 21st Ranger Battalion and the 53rd Infantry Regiment were repeatedly beaten back <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> retake Thuan Man, the under-strength North Vietnamese 10th Regiment captured Duc Lap and the surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E

5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E
5|$|The coaches both chose strong squads <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> win the trophy, though Sounders forward Kenny Cooper, later {{selected}} as Player of the Tournament, {{did not appear}} in the final. The Union's Maurice Edu gave his team the lead with a goal in the first half, but the Sounders equalized with a second half strike by Chad Barrett, and the match went into extra time. Although Philadelphia controlled periods of the match with chances throughout, Clint Dempsey took the lead for Seattle in the first extra time period, and Obafemi Martins sealed a Seattle victory with a late goal. Seattle earned a $250,000 cash prize, as well as a berth into the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League. Philadelphia received a $60,000 cash prize as the competition's runner-up.|$|E
5|$|The ridge {{fell under}} German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank {{each other through}} northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture {{the height of the}} ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E

5|$|Unlike their adversaries, the South Vietnamese {{military}} suffered heavily <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> {{recapture the}} village of Bình Giã and secure the surrounding areas. The South Vietnamese and their American allies lost the total of about 201 personnel killed in action, 192 wounded and 68 missing. In just four days of fighting, two of South Vietnam's elite Ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses, while the 4th Marine Battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force. At that stage of the war, Bình Giã was the worst defeat experienced by the South Vietnamese. Despite their losses, the South Vietnamese army considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument {{at the site of}} the battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake Bình Giã.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E
