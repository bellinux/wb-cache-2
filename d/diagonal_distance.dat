Vertical and horizontal distances of the face were measured electronically at rest, and on posed and aggressive smiles. All measurements were repeated after 8 weeks. Direct measurements of the intercanthal distance were obtained twice with calipers. RESULTS: A minor systematic error was found in the bench experiments, with the highest absolute error of 0. 227 +/- 0. 39 mm.

Two different surf zone sites (A and B) at the Cassino Beach (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) were sampled at three different distances, parallel to the beach (30, 60, and 90 m). Starting 40 m from the beach line, <b>diagonal</b> <b>distances</b> of approximately 50, 70, and 100 m were swept. The total CPUE and CPUA haul distances are compatible with a declining trend in catch rates with increased haul distance at both sites. However, statistically significant differences were observed only for the short distance CPUA (50 m) in relation to the other haul distances at one of the sites sampled. Two fish size groups were observed (TL 40 mm), but only small individuals (< 40 mm) captured in the shorter haul distance at site B showed significant differences in CPUA. This result indicates that size structure for hauls at different distances was equal and that smaller individuals determined the pattern of fish abundance. The net performance indicates that a short haul (< 50 m) is the best strategy to reduce net avoidance and fish escape when using this type of sampling gear...|$|R

40|$|SecB is a homotetrameric cytosolic {{chaperone}} {{that forms}} {{part of the}} protein translocation machinery in E. coli. Due to SecB, nascent polypeptides are maintained in an unfolded translocation-competent state devoid of tertiary structure and thus are guided to the translocon. In vitro SecB rapidly binds {{to a variety of}} ligands in a non-native state. We have previously investigated the bound state conformation of the model substrate bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) as well as the conformation of SecB itself by using proximity relationships based on site-directed spin labeling and pyrene fluorescence methods. It was shown that SecB undergoes a conformational change during the process of substrate binding. Here, we generated SecB mutants containing but a single cysteine per subunit or an exposed highly reactive new cysteine after removal of the nearby intrinsic cysteines. Quantitative spin labeling was achieved with the methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTS) at positions C 97 or E 90 C, respectively. Highfield (W-band) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements revealed that with BPTI present the spin labels are exposed to a more polar/hydrophilic environment. Nanoscale distance measurements with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) were in excellent agreement with distances obtained by molecular modeling. Binding of BPTI also led to a slight change in distances between labels at C 97 but not at E 90 C. While the shorter distance in the tetramer increased, the larger <b>diagonal</b> <b>distance</b> decreased. These findings can be explained by a widening of the tetrameric structure upon substrate binding much like the opening of two pairs of scissors. ...|$|E

A custom built marker cluster consisting of 4 markers in a square arrangement (<b>diagonal</b> <b>distance</b> 2 cm) was used to assess the effect of marker misplacement in the superior, inferior, anterior and posterior direction for the sustentaculum tali (STL), the proximal 1 st metatarsal (P 1 M), distal 5 th metatarsal (D 5 M), proximal 5 th metatarsal (P 5 M) and lateral calcaneus (LCA) markers. In addition manual movement of the heel complex 1 cm superiorly, inferiorly, medially and laterally, and also an alignment error of 10 ° inversion and 10 ° eversion was assessed. Clinically meaningful effects of marker misplacement were determined using a threshold indicating the minimal clinically important difference. Misplacement of the heel-wand complex had the most pronounced effect on mean kinematic profiles during the stance phase across all degrees-of-freedom with respect to hindfoot–tibia and forefoot–hindfoot angles. Vertical marker misplacement of the D 5 M and P 5 M markers affected the sagittal plane, {{and to a lesser extent}} frontal plane, forefoot–hindfoot kinematics.
