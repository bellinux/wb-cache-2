5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that while his decision was correct {{for that particular}} case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|On the July 11 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Kim {{defeated}} Terrell in a ladder match {{to become the}} number one contender to the Knockouts Championship. Kim received her title opportunity on the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, against champion Mickie James; Kim lost the match and afterwards, confronted referee ODB after she <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a dirty pin, beginning a feud between the two. The following week, Kim fought ODB to double count-out. On August 15 at , ODB pinned Kim in a three-way hardcore match, which also included James. Kim and ODB faced off once again in a number one contender {{two out of three}} falls match on the August 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, which ODB won after making Kim submit {{for the first time ever}} in her career, to score the last fall. On October 20 at Bound for Glory, Kim defeated ODB and Brooke a three-way match, following interference from her new ally Lei'D Tapa, to win her third TNA Knockouts Championship.|$|E

5|$|On the October 8 {{episode of}} Raw, the Hardy Boyz won the WCW Tag Team Championship from Booker T and Test. They lost the {{title to the}} Dudley Boyz two weeks later. On the November 12 episode of Raw, they beat Booker T and Test again, but this time for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, they lost the title to the Dudleys in a Steel Cage title {{unification}} match. This defeat led to a break up storyline {{that resulted in a}} match between the brothers at Vengeance. Jeff Hardy would emerge victorious after Lita, who was the special referee, <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Matt Hardy's foot on the rope. The storyline was dropped in January 2002 and the Hardy Boyz reunited.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} his studies at Auburn High School in 1917, Knapp applied for Army officer training, but {{was turned down}} due to his age. Instead, he was accepted as an aviation cadet, receiving his wings and being commissioned as a second lieutenant on March 9, 1918. Knapp went to the United Kingdom with his unit, the 92d Aero Squadron (Bombardment), in August 1918, but <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> action in World War I due to a late shipment of propellers for his unit's Handley Page O/400 bombers.|$|E

In February Carey led frequent bomber escort sorties and ground-attack missions. On 23 February 1942 he engaged in combat again, shooting down a Mitsubishi Ki-51 reconnaissance aircraft over Kayaikto.|$|E

Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November.

Sima Qian thought that Xiang Yu had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his own shortcomings and to make attempts to correct his mistakes, even until his death. Sima Qian {{thought that it was}} ridiculous when Xiang Yu claimed that his downfall was due to Heaven's will and not his personal failure.|$|E

Through much of its history, the franchise <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> significant regular season or playoff success. The Clippers were frequently seen {{as an example of a}} perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers, with whom they have shared a market since 1984 and an arena since 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} {{outcome of}} the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) suggested that the aether was non-existent, findings which were confirmed in subsequent experiments through the 1920s. This led to considerable theoretical work to explain the propagation of light without an aether. A major breakthrough was the theory of relativity, which could explain why the experiment <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> aether, but was more broadly interpreted {{to suggest that it}} was not needed. The Michelson-Morley experiment, along with the blackbody radiator and photoelectric effect, was a key experiment in the development of modern physics, which includes both relativity and quantum theory, the latter of which explains the wave-like nature of light.|$|E
