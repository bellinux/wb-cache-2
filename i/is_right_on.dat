25|$|In 1975, NBC {{canceled}} Jeopardy! {{after moving}} it twice on its daytime schedule, despite having an additional year on its network contract left to fulfill. Griffin produced the show's successor, Wheel of Fortune, which premiered on January 6, 1975. Wheel, with Chuck Woolery as host and Susan Stafford as the hostess, had successful ratings throughout its network run. From December 1975 to January 1976, the show expanded to an hour, {{in response to}} the successful 60-minute version of The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> <b>on</b> CBS.|$|E
25|$|The Plinko {{board is}} often used by RTL Group-licensed lottery promotions, CBS {{affiliates}} and Fremantle's Ludia video game division to promote the show. For the promotions, two fishing lines (one {{on each side of}} the board, hanging from the side down towards the center slot) are used to rig the game so the dropped chip always lands in the $10,000 slot. After an advertisement for the show's Ludia video game was taped, the wires were mistakenly left in place for the 1:00pm taping of The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> <b>on</b> July 22, 2008. As a contestant was playing the game, three consecutive chips she dropped landed in the $10,000 slot. As the fourth chip was being dropped, a co-producer realized that the wires were still in place and stopped the chip as it bounced down the board, informing Carey of the situation. The wires were removed and the entire segment was re-shot for the show from the point where the contestant began dropping chips. CBS Standards and Practices allowed the contestant to keep the $30,000 won prior to the removal of the wires as well as the money won with the five chips after the mistake had been corrected. However, the segment that aired (when the show was broadcast on December 5, 2008) did not refer to the mistake or the amount of money won prior to the removal of the wires.|$|E

500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth/If you let me inside your world,' he sings. The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E

2500|$|In Italian law BDSM <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> {{the border}} between crime and legality, and {{everything}} lies {{in the interpretation of}} the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing [...] "injury" [...] to another person is to be punished. In this context though [...] "injury" [...] is legally defined as [...] "anything causing a condition of illness", and [...] "illness" [...] is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is [...] "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" [...] (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is [...] "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the [...] "victim" [...] may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.|$|E
2500|$|As I Am {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66, based on 22 reviews. Jon Pareles of Blender {{felt that the}} album [...] "advances" [...] from her previous two albums [...] "by showing an experimental side." [...] Spin commented that Keys' songwriting has improvement from her previous work. In a rave review of the album, Gregory Stephen Tate of The Village Voice praised Keys for her vintage soul influence and called As I Am a [...] "complete work". NME perceived the album as a departure from Keys' previous albums and described it as [...] "streetwise, smoky set of real soul". Entertainment Weeklys Neil Drumming described it as [...] "Keys' most polished — if, at times, edgeless — album to date". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that [...] "Keys isn't quite a superwoman come to save R from itself, but the timeless quality of As I Am <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> time." [...] USA Today called it Keys' [...] "most cohesive studio album". Nate Chinen of The New York Times stated [...] "As I Am radiates not just confidence but also experience", and called it Keys' [...] "strongest effort yet". According to The Star-Ledger the album is [...] "another solid effort" [...] but [...] "not the masterpiece that Keys seems capable of producing, someday".|$|E

2500|$|Bob Barker began hosting The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> <b>on</b> September 4, 1972 and {{completed}} a 35-year tenure on June 15, 2007. Barker {{was hired as}} host while still hosting the stunt comedy show Truth or Consequences. His retirement coincided with his 50th year as a television host. His final show aired on June 15, 2007 and was repeated in primetime, leading into the network's coverage of the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards. In addition to hosting, Barker became Executive Producer of the show in March 1988 when Frank Wayne died and continued as such until his retirement, gaining significant creative control over the series between 2000 and his 2007 retirement. He also was responsible for creating several of the show's pricing games, as well as launching The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular primetime spin-off. Reruns of Barker's final season were aired throughout the summer from the Monday after his final show (June 18, 2007) until the Friday before Drew Carey's debut as host (October 12, 2007), when the season 35 finale was re-aired. During his time as host, Barker missed only one taping of four episodes; Dennis James, then hosting the syndicated nighttime version of the show, filled in for him on these shows in December 1974. After he became a noted animal rights advocate in 1981 shortly {{after the death of}} his wife Dorothy Jo, Barker signed off each broadcast, informing viewers with the public service message, [...] "Help control the pet population: have your pets spayed or neutered." [...] Carey continued the tradition upon becoming the new host.|$|E
