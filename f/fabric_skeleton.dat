50|$|Quartz is a {{very common}} crustal mineral that {{undergoes}} crystal plastic deformation {{over a wide range}} of conditions, and there are many descriptions of its deformation microstructures and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) {{from a wide variety of}} metamorphic grades, strain geometries and finite strains. From both the experiments and simulations, it is possible to obtain information from the fabrics that develop during deformation histories. For example, in progressive simple shear the <b>fabric</b> <b>skeleton</b> becomes asymmetric relative to the sense of shear. The fabric orientation and characteristics are controlled by the kinematic framework and bear only an indirect relationship to the finite strain accumulated to that point in the history.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{deformation}} history {{on the development}} of crystallographic preferred orientation in quartzities has been simulated using a computer program based on the Taylor-Bishop-Hill analysis. Model quartzities with different combinations of glide systems have been subjected to various coaxial and non-coaxial deformation histories. It is possible to obtain information from the fabrics that develop during simple histories; for example, the location of the axis of extension is generally associated with a pole free area on a c-axis plot, and progressive axial shortening, plane strain and axial shortening produce characteristic fabrics. In progressive simple shear the <b>fabric</b> <b>skeleton</b> becomes asymmetric relative to the sense of shear and a-axes preferentially align in the flow plane parallel to the flow direction. However, this example illustrates that the fabric orientation and characteristics are controlled by the kinematic framework and bear only an indirect relationship to the finite strain accumulated to that point in the history. The imprint of the closing stages of deformation limits to some degree the use of crystallographic fabrics as a tool for structural geologists, but in favourable circumstances data can be obtained concerning characteristics of the deformation history, on the scale of the hand-specimen, for the last part of this history...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial nano-cellulose (BNC) is {{considered}} to possess incredible potential in biomedical applications due to its innate unrivalled nano-fibrillar structure and versatile properties. However its use is largely restricted by inefficient production and by insufficient strength when {{it is in a}} highly swollen state. In this study, a <b>fabric</b> <b>skeleton</b> reinforced chitosan (CS) /BNC hydrogel with high mechanical reliability and antibacterial activity was fabricated by using an efficient dynamic culture that could reserve the nano-fibrillar structure. By adding CS in culture media to 0. 25 - 0. 75 % (w/v) during bacterial cultivation, the CS/BNC composite hydrogel was biosynthesized in situ on a rotating drum composed of fabrics. With the proposed method, BNC biosynthesis became less sensitive to the adverse antibacterial effects of CS and the production time of the composite hydrogel with desirable thickness could be halved from 10 days to 5 days as compared to the conventional static cultures. Although its concentration was low in the medium, CS accounted for more than 38 % of the CS/BNC dry weight. FE-SEM observation confirmed conservation of the nano-fibrillar networks and covering of CS on BNC. ATR-FTIR showed a decrease in the degree of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and water absorption capacity was improved after compositing with CS. The fabric-reinforced CS/BNC composite exhibited bacteriostatic properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and significantly improved mechanical properties as compared to the BNC sheets from static culture. In summary, the fabric-reinforced CS/BNC composite constitutes a desired candidate for advanced wound dressings. From another perspective, coating of BNC or CS/BNC could upgrade the conventional wound dressings made of cotton gauze to reduce pain during wound healing, especially for burn patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} and crystallographic {{preferred orientation}} (CPO) of quartz were quantified in 17 samples of natural monomineralic tabular veins. The veins opened and were deformed, up to shear strain γ > 15, {{in a small}} temperature window (about 25 °C) above 500 °C, as established by Ti-in-quartz thermometry. The veins filled a set of fractures within the Adamello tonalite (southern Alps, Italy) and localized homogeneous simple shear during postmagmatic cooling. The local (square millimeter scale) and bulk (square centimeter) CPO were investigated by computer-integrated polarization microscopy (CIP) and X-ray texture goniometry. Weakly deformed veins (WDV: γ < 1) consist of millimeter- to centimeter-sized crystals with a strong CPO showing a c-axis girdle slightly inclined, mostly with the shear sense, to the foliation (XY) plane and a strong maximum close to the lineation (X). Moderately deformed veins (MDV: 2 < γ < 3) consist of elongated nonrecrystallized ribbon grains and most have a CPO showing a strong Y maximum of c axes some with weak extension into a YZ girdle. Strongly deformed veins (SDV: γ = 4 to 15) are pervasively to completely recrystallized to fine (34 – 40 μm grain size) aggregates with a strong CPO {{similar to that of}} MDV. The slip systems during plastic deformation were dominantly prism 〈a〉 with subordinate rhomb and basal 〈a〉 slip. Recrystallization occurred rather abruptly for 3 < γ < 4. In contrast to dislocation creep experiments in quartz (and other minerals), a steady-state recrystallized fabric is achieved at early stages of deformation (γ ≈ 4) as there is no evidence, with increasing strain, of strengthening of the CPO, of rotation of the <b>fabric</b> <b>skeleton,</b> or of change in grain size. WDV represent weakly deformed relicts of veins with an initial CPO believed to have developed during crystal growth but unsuitably oriented for prism 〈a〉 slip during subsequent shear. MDV and SDV appear to derive from veins different from WDV, where the vein crystals grew with orientation favorable for prism 〈a〉 slip. The relationship between the initial growth CPO and the kinematic framework suggests that veins opened at a temperature close to that at which there is a switch between the activity of prism 〈c〉 and prism 〈a〉 slip, with the temperature of growth causing growth of crystals well oriented for slip. The initial CPO of veins, from which quartz mylonites are commonly derived, plays a critical role in the fabric evolution. The strong growth- and strain-induced CPOs of these sheared veins inhibited significant reworking during lower temperature stages of pluton cooling when basal 〈a〉 slip would have been dominant...|$|E
40|$|An archaeocyathid-rich biostrome {{complex in}} the middle of the Forteau Formation (Lower Cambrian) of {{southern}} Labrador, is divisible into two facies: (1) Oolite Sand Facies, and (2) Biostrome Facies. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic analysis of the eight selected areas indicates that the Biostrome Facies was deposited seaward of the Oolite Sand Facies and that the palcoslope sloped towards the south or south-east. The highly irregular nature of the contact between the two facies suggests that salients and recesses occurred within the Oolite Sand Facies and that the Biostrome Facies was deposited on shallow swales within recesses. [...] Seven lithologies make up the Oolite Sand Facies: skeletal grainstone, oolitic grainstone, mixed oolitic grainstone, mixed peloid packestone, mixed oncolitic grainstone, intraclast grainstone, dolostone and dolomitic siltstone. These lithologies are considered to form an oolite shoal complex consisting of an active shoal, stable sand channels, storm-affected supra-tidal islands, and leeward oolite shoal spillover lobes. [...] The Biostrome Facies was deposited seaward of, and on shallow swales between, the oolite shoals. This facies consists of five distinct units : Dolomite Mound Unit (BD), Red Mound Unit (BR), Nodular Mound Unit (BN), Oolite Bioherm Unit (BB), and Grey Mound Unit (BG). Each unit consists of two lithofacies : (1) skeletal calcarenite, which does not vary between units, and (2) moundstone, a new nongenetic rock-type applied to mounds or bioherms of uncertain origin. Five different moundstone lithofacies occur, all of which contain archaeocyathids and sometimes calcareous algae, in a mudstone matrix. The moundstones form mounds, biostromes, and rarely bioherms, all flanked by skeletal calcarenites. Dolomitic Moundstones (BD- 1) and Nodular Moundstones (BN- 1) formed in relatively deep water, seaward of Red Moundstone (BR- 1) which accumulated in lateral contact with the action oolite shoal. Grey Moundstone (BG- 1) and Archaeocyathid Bioherms (BB- 2) accumulated on shallow, protected swales between oolite shoals. The Archaeocyathid Bioherm lithofacies is flanked by 'quiet-water' oolitic calcarenites (BB- 1). [...] Diagenetic processes which modified the original depositional texture of the moundstones and calcarenites include: bioerosion, dissolution and cementation, neomorphism, dolomitization, silicification, pressure solution (stylolitization), and fracturing. Diagenetic fabrics were formed by these processes operating in a number of diagenetic environments. Micritization, macroborings and facies specific cementation were formed by processes operating in the submarine diagenetic environment. Selective dolomitization occurred in a zone of mixing between meteoric phreatic and marine phreatic waters. Minor dissolution and widespread cementation occurred in the vadose zone. Fabrics formed in the phreatic environment include extensive stylolitization, dissolution, fracturing, pore-fill cementation, and aggrading neomorphism which includes a transitional micrite-microspar-pseudospar <b>fabric</b> affecting archaeocyathid <b>skeletons.</b> Widespread dolomitization and rare silicification and stylolitization occurred in a late, unspecified diagenetic environment. [...] The autecology of archaeocyathids, calcareous algae, stromatolites, a new, primitive 'coelenterate', brachiopids, trilobites, hyolithids, echinoderms, and agmata (Salterella), is reviewed and three faunal/floral assemblages are recognised: (1) mound-flanking Skeletal Calcarenite faunal assemblage, consisting predominately of echinoderms with brachiopods, trilobites, hyolithids and Salterella, (2) mound-dwelling assemblage, consisting predominantly of archaeocyathids and calcareous algae with brachiopods, trilobites, coelenterate, sponges, hyolithids and the ichnogenus Trypanites, (3) coelobitic (cavity dwelling) assemblage, found mainly beneath retilaminiform archaeocyathids and consisting of pendant calcareous algae, foraminifera, encrusting archaeocyathids, Archaeotrypa, sponges, trilobites, and worms...|$|R
