5|$|<b>Heaven</b> <b>is</b> a {{state of}} unending union with the divine nature of God, not ontologically, but by grace. It is an eternal life, in which the soul contemplates God in ceaseless beatitude.|$|E

5|$|<b>Heaven</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} by an {{entrance to the}} Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to <b>Heaven</b> <b>is</b> shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E

25|$|The Nahua {{people such}} as the Aztecs, Chichimecs and the Toltecs {{believed}} that the <b>heavens</b> <b>were</b> constructed and separated into 13 levels. Each level had from one to many Lords living in and ruling these heavens. Most important of these <b>heavens</b> <b>was</b> Omeyocan (Place of Two). The Thirteen <b>Heavens</b> <b>were</b> ruled by Ometeotl, the dual Lord, creator of the Dual-Genesis who, as male, takes the name Ometecuhtli (Two Lord), and as female is named Omecihuatl (Two Lady).|$|R

5|$|She has {{delivered}} {{to them a}} religion which has revolutionized their lives, banished the glooms that shadowed them, and filled them and flooded them with sunshine and gladness and peace; a religion which has no hell; a religion whose <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> not put off to another time, with a break and a gulf between, but begins here and now, and melts into eternity as fancies of the waking day melt into the dreams of sleep.|$|E
5|$|The tree of <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> a {{very rapidly}} growing tree, {{possibly}} {{the fastest growing}} tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E

5|$|The tree prefers {{moist and}} loamy soils, but is {{adaptable}} {{to a very}} wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade. In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas. The tree of <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> found within {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China. In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.|$|E
5|$|In North America, A. altissima {{is present}} from Massachusetts in the east, west to {{southern}} Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and {{east to the}} north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree. It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> preferable to false security.|$|E

5|$|Tree of <b>heaven</b> <b>is</b> {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once {{very popular in}} cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhism {{there are}} several Heavens, {{all of which are}} still part of samsara (illusionary reality). Those who {{accumulate}} good karma may be reborn in one of them. However, their stay in <b>Heaven</b> <b>is</b> not eternal—eventually they will use up their good karma and will undergo rebirth into another realm, as a human, animal or other being. Because <b>Heaven</b> <b>is</b> temporary and part of samsara, Buddhists focus more on escaping the cycle of rebirth and reaching enlightenment (nirvana). Nirvana is not a heaven but a mental state.|$|E
