5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, {{told him that}} he had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four in three months in sixty battalions; by his reckoning, this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By this time in the war, his contributions to sniping <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, {{he was aware that}} the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E
5|$|Warwick <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him {{in terms of}} power and popularity. Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked {{the downfall of the}} House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on the spot where Warwick purportedly died.|$|E

The Theatre served as one of three screening locations for the Woodstock Film Festival, along with theaters in Rhinebeck and Woodstock. After years of resisting live entertainment, the Theatre allowed its stage {{to be used as}} a platform for a John Kerry rally on October26, 2004. It was the first time there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an event in the building in over 55years. By 2005, live performances were commonplace at the Theatre. The acoustics of the building also made it suitable for musical performances, beginning in autumn 2006 with a jazz performance by Kevin Mahogany.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{operating}} {{revenues from the}} congestion charge did not reach the levels that were originally expected. Within {{six months of the}} start of the scheme, the reduction in traffic <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> that TfL were predicting a £65million revenue shortfall.|$|E

He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} sonnet was revived in Britain, with William Wordsworth writing more sonnets {{than any}} other British poet. Other important Romantic lyric writers of the period include Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron. Later in the century, the Victorian lyric was more linguistically self-conscious and defensive than the Romantic forms <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Such</b> Victorian lyric poets include Alfred Lord Tennyson and Christina Rossetti.|$|E
25|$|By late December 1764 rumors {{had begun}} {{circulating}} {{that there might}} be a pair of beasts behind the killings. This was because there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a high number of attacks in such a short space of time, many had appeared to have been recorded and reported at the same time. Some contemporary accounts suggest the creature had been seen with another such animal, while others thought the beast was with its young.|$|E

25|$|Because witness {{intimidation}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> {{an important issue}} during the initial trial, witness protection was a prominent feature in both trials. During both trial the Prosecution took great pains to protect the identity of witnesses called to testify. This often included, voice modification, pseudonyms, {{and in some cases}} witness relocation. During the retrial, the Court took the extraordinary measure of moving the entire court to an undisclosed secret location in order to secure the testimony of a protected witness. These efforts paid off.|$|E
25|$|Hardy {{frequently}} conceived of, {{and wrote}} about, supernatural forces, {{particularly those that}} control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.|$|E

When {{childhood}} friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, Irons left the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons stated {{that he did not want}} to be part of a group where his friends were dying. In 2006, Irons said Slovak's death <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a huge shock that he had been suffering from depression ever since.|$|E

25|$|The {{new version}} was so {{promising}} that the Navy had 15 built {{and shipped to}} China before they had completed testing. They arrived in Manchuria in July 1940, and first saw combat over Chungking in August. There they proved to be completely untouchable by the Polikarpov I-16s and I-153s that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> {{a problem for the}} A5Ms when in service. In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.|$|E
25|$|The Mbunda {{system of}} {{traditional}} rule <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> that sovereign {{rule of the}} entire Kingdom was vested in the king who had {{to come from the}} central matrilineal line of the royal hierarchy. This somewhat limited the number of aspiring royals to the central throne. The King had absolute authority so that when he made a decision his or her decision was not questioned but was to be carried out. The two main functions of a King were to legislate rules and govern the community. At the same time there was an effective, decentralized system of traditional rule in the numerous areas and localities.|$|E

In a one-sided series which Australia won 4-0, with one match drawn, Nicholson took only three catches in the first four matches, and, after making 0 in both innings of the fourth Test, was dropped for the fifth match in favour of Edward van der Merwe. He batted low in the order and made just 76 runs in eight innings, one of them not out.|$|E

25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} Light Brigade <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a {{traumatic}} event that the allies were incapable of further action that day. Of the 666 men known to have ridden in the charge (sources vary slightly), 271 became casualties: 110 killed (less than 17%), 129 wounded, plus another 32 wounded and taken prisoner. Additionally, 375 horses were killed. Raglan could not now risk using his infantry divisions in any attempt to move Liprandi's forces from the Causeway Heights. Even if the redoubts were retaken, {{they would have to}} be defended by men whose priority was the siege of Sevastopol, and he dared not expose his supply base at Balaclava to further Russian attacks. The British 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions, therefore, returned to the plateau, the former without its Highland regiments who were ordered to remain in the valley under Campbell’s command.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E
