This was just a week before the report was scheduled to be made public by an NRA-appointed panel. Although the leaked information was not secret, for it contained a summary of public discussions, the incident was rather an embarrassment for the NRA because it undermined its policy of transparency and neutrality. Japan Atomic Power Co. was eager to get the information, because it wanted to prepare its counter arguments in the discussions. Although no money was paid for it, Tetsuo Nayuki, the NRA-official involved, was fired, because he violated the strict NRA regulations that, to ensure transparency, forbid single NRA staff members to meet {{officials of}} nuclear power plant operators. On 1 February, Nayuki was transferred to his former post at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.|$|E

40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products (PPR) and their {{residues}} {{to deliver a}} Scientific Opinion on the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) potential of the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid. An in vitro study (Kimura-Kuroda et al., 2012) suggested that excitation and/or desensitisation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by these compounds might affect developing mammalian nervous systems as occurs with nicotine. To evaluate the DNT potential of acetamiprid and imidacloprid, the PPR Panel scrutinised the open literature, the <b>draft</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>reports</b> and dossiers submitted for approval. The Panel concludes that both compounds may affect neuronal development and function, although several methodological limitations have been identified. Considering the available DNT studies for imidacloprid and acetamiprid, important uncertainties still remain and further in vivo studies following OECD test guideline (TG) 426 are required to robustly characterise a DNT potential and dose-response relationships, particularly for acetamiprid. The Panel considers that current ARfDs may not be protective enough for the possible DNT of acetamiprid and imidacloprid and no reliable conclusion can be drawn as regards the ADI for acetamiprid. More conservative reference values are proposed based on {{the analysis of the}} existing toxicological data. However, the current ADI for imidacloprid is considered adequate to protect against its potential developmental neurotoxic effects. Limitations of the in vitro system used by Kimura-Kuroda et al. (2012) prevent its current use as a screening tool in the regulatory arena. The PPR Panel encourages the definition of clear and consistent criteria at EU level to trigger submission of mandatory DNT studies, which could include development of an integrated DNT testing strategy composed of robust, reliable and validated in vitro assays and other alternative methods complementary to the in vivo TG 426 for assessing the DNT potential of substances...|$|R

In order to accommodate for the intended use of quizalofop-P-tefuryl in Greece, it is proposed to raise the existing MRLs for quizalofop (established for the residue definition quizalofop (including quizalofop-P)) in sunflower seed and cotton seed from 0. 1 mg/kg (set at the limit of quantification) to 1 mg/kg and 0. 2 mg/kg, respectively. Greece drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 31 July 2009.

40|$|The BfR {{has been}} asked to provide its expert opinion on the {{publication}} “Major pesticides are more toxic to human cells than their declared active principles” by the French task force led by Prof. Gilles-Eric Séralini. It is hypothesized that many pesticides (= plant protection products, PPP) are more toxic to humans and animals due to their mixed-in additives than their actual tested and approved active substances. This hypothesis is supported by cytotoxicity testing results derived from tests with nine active substances (including glyphosate) and one formulation of each active substance. The new publication by Mesnage et al. (2014) provides further indications that some PPP may have higher toxicity than the active substances contained therein. However, the publica-tion does not provide any new information for the toxicological assessment of glyphosate and no general regulatory consequences can be derived from it. The publication’s aspects re-garding the toxicological assessment of mixed-in additives in PPP are already incorporated in the BfR´s <b>draft</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>report,</b> which was prepared during the re-evaluation process of the active substance glyphosate in December 2013.

40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues {{to develop an}} Opinion on the {{identification}} of pesticides {{to be included in}} cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) {{on the basis of their}} toxicological profile. In 2008, the PPR Panel adopted an Opinion on the suitability of existing methodologies for cumulative risk assessment of pesticides and a tiered approach was proposed, which was applied to a selected group of triazole pesticides in 2009. The present Opinion suggests a methodology for grouping of pesticides based on phenomenological effects and provides CAGs for the thyroid and nervous system. This approach can be applied even when the underlying biochemical events mediating the effects are not understood, and is based on a standardised and thorough review of <b>Draft</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Reports</b> (DARs) supporting the approval of all pesticides in Europe, and on recommendations from the European Commission. Pesticidal active substances exhibiting neurotoxic properties were allocated to CAGs for acute effects on motor, sensory and autonomic divisions of the nervous system and neurochemical endpoints. Chronic effects across the same divisions/endpoints and neuropathological effects were collated. Active substances having adverse effects on the thyroid system were allocated to CAGs for effects either on C-cells/the calcitonin system or on follicular cells/the T 3 /T 4 system. The PPR Panel notes that the resulting groups encompass many pesticides and also that individual pesticides could appear in several groups and therefore the data entries for performing cumulative risk assessment (CRA) are of considerable magnitude. Although some CAGs contain a large number of pesticides, little indication of cumulative risk may be inferred from the size of CAGs per se. The PPR Panel recommends that the methodology is implemented for all major organ/systems but the approach used should be considered specific for pesticides...|$|R
