2500|$|..... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Internet’s under {{much greater}} attack {{than it has}} been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of {{commercial}} interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms. But they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2013, an {{interview}} was published quoting Ewen confirming {{that the group}} had split. Ewen was quoted saying [...] "This is a tricky one because I don't feel comfortable lying, saying we're in the studio recording and we're going to bring music out next year, {{which seems to be}} the favoured line," [...] she said. [...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost. I don't like all the drama and the negativity. We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can't get away from it," [...] she said. [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't think the same when I was approached. I was like, 'Is this going to work? Are people going to accept it?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not like}} to make insinuations, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> above {{statistics}} darkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water [...] "on the sly." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This place isnt just illegal, its immoral, and <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{can afford}} to keep it open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. At {{one time}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> deacon meant {{to make his}} testament; but I {{conclude}} {{that he must have}} changed his mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> wind {{would hold}} out," [...] replied Frank, {{with a wry}} face. [...] "This is going to spoil everything. Did anybody bring his skates?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "I can't {{remember}} {{using the}} word hyena, exactly, though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> way you talk about Christmas is dreadful. But I take back the laughing hyena." ...|$|E
6000|$|HERBERT. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> King Was potent in the election, and why not? Why {{should not}} Heaven have so {{inspired}} the King? Be comforted. Thou art the man--be thou A mightier Anselm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{father has}} been out from morning until night, Wilfrid, {{managing}} the farm," [...] Mrs. Renshaw said with a glad smile, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> exercise has done him {{a great deal of}} good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've said nothing. Don't like house-cleaning {{well enough}} to suggest it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint. Is she going to upset the whole place?" [...] asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect.|$|R
5000|$|However, John Whittingdale, {{a former}} Culture Secretary, {{publicly}} defended the show by saying: [...] "If the BBC has commissioned {{a production of}} a decent play how can one possibly object to that?" [...] he asked. [...] "High-quality drama {{is at the heart}} of public service broadcasting...Some of my colleagues get hysterical about this kind of thing. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Queen is the least bit offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, of course, possible, Miss Hannay, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> risk {{is greater}} than that run by those who stay here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's o' no use, Mr Charles; we {{must run}} it now--the current's too strong to make head against. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> man has only seen a bear, or somethin' o' that sort, for I see he's ashore, and jumpin' among the bushes like a caribou." ...|$|E
60|$|July 8.--Wrote a good task this morning. I may be mistaken; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> tale of Elspat McTavish[296] in my bettermost manner--but J.B. roars for chivalry. He {{does not}} quite {{understand}} that everything may be overdone in this world, or sufficiently estimate {{the necessity of}} novelty. The Highlanders have been off the field now for some time.|$|E
6000|$|Juanita Haydock rattled, [...] "They're ungrateful, {{all that}} class of people. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{domestic}} problem is simply becoming awful. I don't {{know what the}} country's coming to, with these Scandahoofian clodhoppers demanding every cent you can save, and so ignorant and impertinent, and on my word, demanding bath-tubs and everything--as if they weren't mighty good and lucky at home if they got a bath in the wash-tub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think.</b> See, <b>the</b> flame {{is growing}} brighter. Either it's the cabin or that cattle shed {{he has been}} building. Come on; we'll soon know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, yes, I {{know just}} how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just exactly how you feel. No longer ago than {{yesterday}} noon, my Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{laughed at}} his pretty apologue, and {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> authorities would trouble themselves about me--also that I was not fond of running away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad luck {{to their}} reports! That's always {{the way of}} it. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> best way to take reports is to belaive the exact {{opposite}} o' what's towld ye, an' so ye'll come nearest the truth. It's thrue I had a close shave. Wan day I felt a sort o' light-hiddedness--as if I was a kind o' livin' balloon--and was floatin' away, whin the doctor came an' looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{girl looked}} anxiously {{up in my}} face as if to read my thoughts, and then said, in a low voice,--`No, I neither carry the medicine-bag nor hold palaver with spirits; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> good Manito must have led me here. I wandered into the woods because I could not sleep, and I saw you pass. But tell me,' she added, with still deeper anxiety, `does the white-feather come alone? Does he {{approach}} friends during the dark hours with a soft step like a fox?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those are {{the sort}} of places they do go to. There is young Mrs. Bright Newdegate,--she {{had to go to}} South Shields, and her babies are all dreadfully delicate. She lost two, you know. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Lord Chancellor ought to think about that. Reigate, or Maidstone, or {{anywhere}} about Great Marlow would not be so bad." [...] And in this way they discussed the coming event and the happy future, while Felix himself was listening to the judge's charge and thinking of his client's guilt.|$|E
6000|$|HOW do {{you like}} to go up in a swing, [...] Up in the air so blue? [...] Oh, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> it <b>the</b> pleasantest thing [...] Ever a child can do! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kadir Buksh," [...] said I, [...] "that {{was well}} done, {{for the dog}} would surely have killed thee. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> white soldier will come any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} that they ought, and never thought so. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> wishes of all her family should have very great weight with a girl that has been well brought up." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{heart of}} a moonbeam is a pretty enough Friendship's-Album expression--let it pass, though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> figure a little strained; but humility has no tint, humility has no complexion, and if it had it could not mantle the earth. A moonbeam might--I do not know--but she did not {{say it was the}} moonbeam. But let it go, I cannot decide it, she mixes me up so. A babe hasn't [...] "tearful lips," [...] it's its eyes. You find none of Mrs. Eddy's kind of English in Science and Health--not a line of it.|$|E
6000|$|Vida Sherwin came {{in after}} school, with Miss Ethel Villets, the town librarian. Miss Sherwin's optimistic {{presence}} gave Carol more confidence. She talked. She informed the circle [...] "I drove almost down to Wahkeenyan with Will, {{a few days}} ago. Isn't the country lovely! And I do admire the Scandinavian farmers down there so: their big red barns and silos and milking-machines and everything. Do you all know that lonely Lutheran church, with the tin-covered spire, that stands out alone on a hill? It's so bleak; somehow it seems so brave. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Scandinavians are the hardiest and best people----" ...|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "angels" [...] are {{the only}} things of which I am not a little sick--but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{preference}} of writers to agents--the mighty stir made about scribbling and scribes, by themselves and others--a sign of effeminacy, degeneracy, and weakness. Who would write, who had any thing better to do? [...] "Action--action--action"--said Demosthenes: [...] "Actions--actions," [...] I say, and not writing,--least of all, rhyme. Look at the querulous and monotonous lives of the [...] "genus;"--except Cervantes, Tasso, Dante, Ariosto, Kleist (who were brave and active citizens), Æschylus, Sophocles, and some other of the antiques also--what a worthless, idle brood it is! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Judith was {{the name}} the Delawares mentioned, though it was {{pronounced}} after a fashion of their own. From their discourse, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> girl would much please my fancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>do</b> what <b>I</b> can, Mr. Godolphin," [...] Maxwell promised, {{while he}} knitted his brows in perplexity [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> very {{strength}} of Salome gives relief to Haxard--gives him greater importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We mustn’t count our {{chickens}} too soon, Mr. Palethorpe,” Will laughed; “but nevertheless <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> {{prospects are}} favourable. Still, I must wait {{the result of}} the search that my lawyer has been carrying on.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{will save}} her youth, perhaps her life,' whispered Mark, lifting Nuttie's {{hand to his}} lips for a moment, and then vanishing, while Annaple {{recovered}} enough to say, 'I'm tougher than that, sir. But little Jenny! Oh, Nuttie, I believe it has come in time. I've known all along that one straw more might break the camel's back. We've been very happy, but I am glad it is over before Mark got worn down before his time. Grinding is very wholesome, but one may have too much; and I haven't Mark's scruples, Nuttie dear, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> place is more in his line than yours or Mr. Dutton's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose you're right, dear child," [...] {{said the}} man, after a pause; [...] "an' <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Lord has saved me, for I never before felt as I do now--hatred {{of my old}} bad ways, and an awful desire to do right for His sake. If any o' my mates had told me I'd feel an' act like this a week ago, I'd have called him a fool. I can't {{understand}} it. I suppose that God must have changed me altogether. My only fear is that I'll fall back again into the old bad ways--I'm so helpless for anything good, d'ee see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose not, for you see he isn't dead. Another time, {{when we were}} melting glue, we upset a {{whole lot}} of fat, and the chimney caught fire; and wasn't that a go? Bill got a pistol out of Jack's room, and fired it up the chimney to bring the soot down; and down it came with a vengeance! He was {{regularly}} singed, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> place would have been burned {{if it had not been}} too old! All the Shapcotes ran out into the court, hallooing Fire! and the engine came, but there was nothing for it to do. Oh, the face Wilmet would make to see that kitchen. Kettle's biling--I must run.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} supposed, the teacher {{concluded}} {{to appeal to}} emulation. While I describe the measure he adopted, let it be remembered that I am now only approving of the resort to ingenuity and invention, and the employment of moral and intellectual means, for the accomplishment of his purposes, and not of the measures themselves. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> plan <b>I</b> am going to describe a wise one; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> teacher, while trying it, must {{have been interested in}} his intellectual experiment. His business, while pursued in such a way, could not have been a mere dull and uninteresting routine.|$|R
6000|$|Glad of any laughter, Carol {{joined the}} frolic, and {{surprised}} them by crying, [...] "Dave, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>the</b> dearest thing since {{you got your}} hair cut!" [...] That was an excellent sally. Everybody applauded. Kennicott looked proud.|$|R
60|$|At <b>the</b> {{same time}} <b>I</b> <b>DO</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> Government {{makes a mistake}} in taxing the profits of the poor book writers under the absurd name of INCOME. But let that go. The Kaiser would {{probably}} treat us worse.|$|R
