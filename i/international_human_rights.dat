5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law.

40|$|The {{contention}} that an unborn child {{has the right}} to life has been visited with several oppositions from all works of life, all over the world. Most people do not accept the view that an unborn child possesses any form of <b>human</b> <b>right</b> which is to be protected because, that child is yet to be born into the world. It is however an established fact that, the fundamental principle of <b>international</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> instrument is to uphold the dignity and sanctity of all human persons, whether born or unborn. This shows that <b>international</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> instruments are founded on the basis of natural law. This study set out to investigate the core principle of <b>international</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> law. By so doing, the actual values and tenants of <b>international</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> law will be revealed. This is a doctrinal research, wherein the authors set out on a fact finding mission using selected articles, books and periodicals to bring out the objective of the study. At the end of the exercise, it was revealed that no <b>international</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> law will perpetrate a principle in opposition to natural law. This being the case, the unborn child, like any other living being is vested with the inalienable right to life...|$|R
