50|$|One {{particularly}} notable use of glass-ceramics is in {{the processing}} of ceramic matrix composites.

One solution to this is to use the glassy form of the ceramic as the sintering feedstock rather than the ceramic, as unlike the ceramic the <b>glass</b> <b>pellets</b> have a softening point and will generally flow at much lower pressures and temperatures.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of an antimicrobial ZnO-glass {{in the form}} of powder and {{in the form of}} sintered pellets were studied in water, artificial seawater, biological complex media such as common bacterial/yeast growth media (Luria Bertani (LB), yeast extract, tryptone), and human serum. It has been established that the media containing amino acids and proteins produce a high lixiviation of Zn 2 + from the glass due to the ability of zinc and zinc oxide to react with amino acids and proteins to form complex organic compounds. The process of Zn 2 + lixiviation from the glass network has been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From these results we can state that the process of lixiviation of Zn 2 + from the glass network is similar to the one observed in sodalime glasses, where Na + is lixiviated to the media first and the fraction of Zn that acts as modifiers (2 / 3) is lixiviated in second place. After the subsequent collapse of the outer surface glass layer (about 200 – 300 nm thick layer) the dissolution process starts again.

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the drying}} of sintered <b>glass</b> porous <b>pellets</b> initially saturated with a sodium chloride solution. The {{objective is to}} develop {{a better understanding of the}} interplay between evaporation, ions transport and crystallization. The focus is on the characterization of the drying kinetic and its dependence on the development of salt crystals at the porous media surface. Together with analysis of the drying curves in relation with direct visualizations of the sample surface, quantitative pieces of information on the efflorescence growth and structure are obtained from X-ray computed tomography imaging. The study shows that markedly different results are obtained depending on the mean pore size of pellet. This is explained by the completely different efflorescence structure resulting from the drying process. A very thin salt crust is obtained for sufficiently small pores whereas cauliflower like efflorescence structures are obtained for sufficiently large pores. The salt crust tends to severely reduce the evaporation rate whereas the cauliflower like efflorescence does not affect the evaporation rate compared to pure water drying as long as the efflorescence is wet. In the case of the cauliflower type, the X-ray computed tomography images indicate a greater efflorescence growth at the periphery of the porous medium surface. The analysis of the data also suggests that the mean pore size in the efflorescence is significantly smaller than in the underlying porous medium...|$|R
