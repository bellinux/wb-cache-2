5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan.</b> The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
25|$|McCain's 2006 rating by The Almanac of American Politics (2008) on Economic Policy is 64% conservative, 35% liberal (52% conservative, 47% {{liberal in}} 2005). McCain fleshed out the main points of <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan</b> in an April 15, 2008 speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. In summary, McCain {{would make the}} Bush tax cuts {{permanent}} instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit. At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending {{for a year or}} more, and reduce Medicare growth. He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs. In 2013, the National Journal gave McCain an economic rating of 61% conservative and 38% liberal.|$|E

500|$|Former advisors {{commented that}} Perot, who had {{achieved}} ballot access in 24 states, was unwilling [...] "to {{spend money on}} things that mattered" [...] including Rollins' and Jordan's proposed $150 million advertising campaign, was [...] "obsessed" [...] with his image, and lost interest in running after receiving negative press. Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that [...] "the tears have not stopped." [...] A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida {{to force him to}} remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that Perot's campaign had been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. [...] At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan,</b> but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan,</b> which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively.|$|E

Nevertheless, Catiline was defeated by Cicero and Antonius Hybrida in the consular election, largely because the Roman aristocracy feared Catiline and <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan.</b> The Optimates were particularly repulsed because he promoted the plight of the urban plebs along with his economic policy of tabulae novae, the universal cancellation of debts.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Phraya Manopakorn, Phraya Phahon became the new Prime Minister. In his reign, the younger {{officers}} of the Khana Ratsadon, chiefly their leader Phibunsongkhram, played a decisive role. Pridi Phanomyong was expelled from the charge of communism, but <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan</b> was largely ignored. Only {{a few of his}} ideas, such as the expansion of primary schools and industrialization with state enterprises, were gradually implemented. In 1933, Pridis founded the Thammasat University in Bangkok, which with its liberal self-image has remained a symbol of freedom and democracy. At the same time, the nationalist group led by Phibunsongkhram strengthened in the People's Party, oriented to the totalitarian ideas of Italy, Germany, Japan, but also the [...] "young Turks" [...] (Kemal Ataturk).|$|E

With Bowen's backing, he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination to run for Governor in 1980. In the general election he was opposed by Democrat John Hillenbrand. Orr focused on connecting himself with the popular Governor Bowen; his slogan was [...] "Let's Keep a Good Thing Going."

5000|$|Bucaram had no {{alternative}} but to take strong anti-popular economic measures. Bucaram was a populist, so he had no defined political tendency.

50|$|Pridi and <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan</b> {{might be}} one of the reasons causing the turmoil. The {{accusation}} of him as a communist, the divided of the People’s party and the first coup along with the rebellion squeezed his political power. The liberal and socialist civilian faction was weakened. Phahon’s supporters won a clear mandate in the national elections and built a single-minded government party. Ironically, absolute monarchy was eventually replaced by an absolute military oligarchy.|$|E

5000|$|Inspired by the IMF, Minister of Finance Francisco Mayoraga {{quickly put}} {{together}} an economic [...] "Plan of 100 Days." [...] This plan, also called the [...] "Mayoraga Plan," [...] cut the deficit and helped to lower inflation. Loss of jobs and higher prices under the plan, however, also resulted in crippling public and private-sector strikes throughout the country. Mayoraga's tenure in office barely exceeded the 100 days of <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan.</b> By the end of 1990, the government was forced to abandon most of its freemarket reforms.|$|E

Mba Obame's television channel, TV+, was prevented from broadcasting; the opposition alleged that this was done for political reasons. Mamboundou claimed to have won the elections with 39.13% of the vote (as the elections were to be decided on a first past the post basis, a plurality was sufficient for victory), while Mba Obame claimed to have won a simple majority, 50.1%.|$|R

He also faced harsh criticism when he eliminated the External Credit Committee in 1995 and was accused of abuse and subjection to public indebtedness. In response to the corruption allegations against him, Ballén called for a second popular referendum to allow reforms as per modernization of the state, which were largely rejected.|$|E
5000|$|This Chollima movement, however, was {{not able}} to remain {{successful}} indefinitely. The nation obtained the short-term gains in quantity of production but at the cost of lower quality. The economy was distorted as resources were shifted to extensively fund industries while neglecting other needed sectors. Human exhaustion also followed this movement. [...] Little labor remained and resources were stretched to their limits. Economic output began to fall and by 1961 the nation was facing an exhausted labor force. During the mid 1960s the DPRK stopped publishing economic statistics except for percentage increase over previous periods. The Kim Il Sung-directed economy undoubtedly needed alterations. Kim Il-Sung however, had no economists who were willing or able to tell him that <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plans</b> needed to be changed.

As a result, during the 1982 midterm elections, Republican gains made in the House of Representatives during the 1980 election were reversed. However, control of the Senate was retained by the Republicans.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} themes of Service's {{reporting}} were that (1) the nationalists were incompetent {{and likely to}} lose in a power struggle with the CPC, and that (2) the CPC seemed to be worthy successors with whom the U.S. should try to establish relations. Prior to {{the outbreak of the}} Chinese Civil War in 1946, Service had predicted that the CPC would prevail, thanks to their ability to stamp out corruption, gain popular support, and to organize grass root organizations. The scenarios that Service envisioned in his reports from Dixie Mission about CPC's future management of China were rose-colored, or incomplete. Mao's implementation of <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plans</b> was harsh, and undemocratic. Service hoped that the CPC would adopt free market and democratic reforms if they were pushed in the right direction, with U.S. support.

50|$|Wilson's {{advisers}} Patrick Blackett and Thomas Balogh {{advised him}} to recreate a new ministry, {{to be called the}} Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), in order to drive through <b>his</b> <b>economic</b> <b>plan.</b> Wilson wanted to divide the functions of the Treasury in two, in part to reduce its power. The DEA, as it soon became known, would undertake long-term planning of the economy and industry, while the Treasury would determine short-term revenue raising and financial management. The DEA was therefore tasked with the preparation of a National Plan for the economy, which was published in September 1965.|$|E
