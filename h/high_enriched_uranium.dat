5000|$|Both the US and Russia have {{committed}} to recycle their nuclear weapons into fuel for electricity production. This program {{is known as}} the Megatons to Megawatts Program. [...] Down blending 500 t of Russian weapons <b>high</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (HEU) will result in about [...] of low enriched uranium (LEU) over 20 years. This is equivalent to about [...] of natural U, or just over twice annual world demand. Since 2000, 30 t of military HEU is displacing about [...] of uranium oxide mine production per year which represents some 13% of world reactor requirements.|$|E
50|$|So far, most {{fast neutron}} {{reactors}} have used either MOX (mixed oxide) or metal alloy fuel. Soviet fast neutron reactors {{have been using}} (<b>high</b> U-235 <b>enriched)</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel. The Indian prototype reactor has been using uranium-carbide fuel.|$|R
5000|$|The PARR-II Reactor is an [...] {{designed}} and constructed reactor {{owned by the}} Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. The PARR-II Reactor's design is similar to Miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR) and SLOWPOKE reactor. The reactor was indigenously designed by the PAEC as the chairman Munir Ahmad Khan {{and his team of}} engineers and scientists also led the construction of the reactor. The PARR-II Reactor had gone critical and began operating on 21 January 1974. The PARR-II Reactor is a tank-in-pool reactor with a rated power of 27-30 kW. Same as the first reactor, the reactor is designed to use the <b>High</b> <b>Enrich</b> <b>Uranium</b> (HEU) fuel. The HEU fuel use the ~90% 235U at a power level of 30 kW. The demineralised light water is used as a coolant moderator and the reactor core is reflected by metallic Be4.|$|R
50|$|Water, {{the most}} common coolant in thermal reactors, is {{generally}} not a feasible coolant for a fast reactor, because it acts as a neutron moderator. However the Generation IV reactor known as the supercritical water reactor with decreased coolant density may reach a hard enough neutron spectrum {{to be considered a}} fast reactor. Breeding, which is the primary advantage of fast over thermal reactors, may be accomplished with a thermal, light-water cooled & moderated system using very <b>high</b> <b>enriched</b> (~90%) <b>uranium.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mexico {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} which has technical capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons. [...] However it has renounced them and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes following the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968. In the 1970s Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully achieved the creation of highly enriched uranium which is used in nuclear power plants and in the construction of nuclear weapons. However the country agreed in 2012 to downgrade the <b>high</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> used on its nuclear power plants to low enriched uranium, the process was realised with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is unknown if Mexico ever created or possessed nuclear or any other kind of mass destruction weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nuclear plant}} {{had a long}} lasting {{contract}} with the nuclear recycling-factory in La Hague. This contract will end in 2015. Since 2006 {{it was impossible to}} transport the used fuel-rod to France, because the French laws on nuclear fuel were changed. The new law insisted that the nuclear waste should return to The Netherlands within a short period. This required a change in Dutch law too, but it took 5 years before all new permissions for transports were handled by the [...] "Raad van State", and all questions of civilians and all opposition against the transports were handled properly. All that time it was impossible to send spent fuel to France, and the used fuel rods were piling up in the spent fuel pool. Between 2012 and 2015 ten transports were planned, in which each time 50 percent more fuel rods than usual would be taken by train to La Hague. The reprocessed uranium would be enriched in Russia, by mixing it with <b>high</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> from nuclear-powered submarines, discarded after the cold-war. A quarter of the uranium would stay in Russia, to be used in nuclear power stations there. The first transport was at 7 June 2011. Although activists tried to delay the transport, the next day the fuel rods arrived in La Hague.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Five U. S. high {{performance}} research reactors (HPRRs) are currently {{part of an}} international nonproliferation program {{with the objective of}} ultimately converting their highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (HEU) fuel to a new <b>high</b> density, low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> (LEU) fuel while still maintaining their reactor kinetic and thermal hydraulic performance. A uranium-molybdenum (U-Mo) alloy is under development as the proposed LEU fuel. This prototypic fuel must be qualified through the relevant regulator (either the Department of Energy (DoE) or Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)) prior to its implementation in the HPRRs. One particular aspect of this qualification being investigated is the hydro-mechanical integrity of the fuel elements during typical operation conditions; with emphasis on coolant-clad reactions. Due to the highly turbulent flow conditions which produce extreme viscous forces over the plate type fuel elements found in the HPRRs, interfacial reactions regarding the prototypic fuel are of concern for the fuel's qualification. One issue associated with coolant-clad interactions is the onset mechanical fuel plate instability induced by the flow field. This phenomenon has the potential to induce sufficient plate membrane stresses to challenge the hydro- and thermo-mechanical integrity of the elements. In this study, a flow induced vibration model is developed to characterize elastic plate motion of a single HPRR fuel plate in an attempt to address plate instability concerns associated with HPRR elements...|$|R

40|$|Technetium- 99 m is a {{radiopharmaceutical}} {{currently used}} in 85 % of all diagnostic imaging procedures. The relative long lived parent isotope of technetium- 99 m is molybdenum- 99, which is commonly produced by irradiating highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> In {{accordance with the}} Department of Energy: National Nuclear Security Administration’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative an effort is underway to develop low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> based molybdenum- 99 production concepts. Achieving comparable molybdenum- 99 yields in a low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> target effectively mandates {{the use of a}} high density metal low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> foil. Using a foil requires a significant modification to the current highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> dispersion target designs. One design concept uses a low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> foil sandwiched between either two flat or curved aluminum plates. The low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> is enclosed in the sandwiched structure by welding the aluminum plates together about their edges. The plate design is inspired by low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> fuel plates with the exception that the low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> is not bonded to the aluminum plates nor is it necessary to clamp the plate edges to prevent lateral translation. The lack of bonding between the low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> foil and the plates allows easy removal of the foil after irradiation for chemically processing and separation. The un-heated edges of the plate target produce three-dimensional temperature gradients inducing deformations and stress. This paper will review the thermal mechanical response of a low <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> foil based molybdenum- 99 production target.
