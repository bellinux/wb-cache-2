40|$|Abstract. The <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> is a {{main part}} of driving axle {{and it is one}} of the main sources of {{vibration}} and noise in the automobile transmission. Study on mechanisms of vibration and noise of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair,</b> and investigating on reducing its vibration and noise are of great significance. Firstly, a simplified dynamic model of the hypoid gears of main reducer, with considering the time-varying teeth stiffness and teeth surface friction damping, was established. Then, on the basis of the above work, a non-linear vibration equation of the hypoid gear with the backlash was derived. Lastly, a numerical simulation method was employed to calculate different gear backlash effects on the hypoid gear vibration behaviors caused by the gear worn, and effects on the gear non-linear vibration from different work speeds of gear and different loading torques were investigated...|$|E

The influence of gear torsional dynamic response is taken into account in a 4 -Degree of Freedom (DoF) model. The contact geometry and kinematics of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> are estimated, using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA). Two fully formulated gear lubricants of the same viscosity grade (SAE 75 W- 90) blended with the same additive pack, but with different types and concentration of viscosity modifier (VM) are considered. Conjunctional friction is predicted for viscous shear of fully characterised lubricants as well as boundary interaction of rough surfaces. The results show loss of friction resulting in resonant response of the gear pair with impact of meshing teeth exhibiting non-linear jump phenomenon. The predictions also show that lubricants with higher pressure – viscosity (PV) coefficients tend to exhibit increased power loss...|$|E

This conference paper {{was presented at the}} 7 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress, Graz, Austria, 2013. [URL] paper presents an investigation into Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) modeling of differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{that can be used in}} coupling with Newtonian (or multibody) dynamics to study Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomena, such as axle whine. The latter is a noise of a tonal nature, emitted from differential axles, characterised by the gear meshing frequency and its multiples. It appears at a variety of operating conditions; during drive and coasting, high and low torque loading. Key design targets for differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are improved efficiency and reduced vibration, which depend critically on the formation of an EHL lubricant film. The stiffness and damping of the oil film and friction generated in the contact can have important effects and cannot be neglected when examining the NVH behaviour of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> The operating conditions in <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are usually characterized by high load, relatively low speeds, angled flow and elliptical contact footprint of high aspect ratio. Some extrapolated/empirical equations to estimate friction and film thickness have been reported for moderate loads. However, their use in <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is questionable. Additionally, the majority of reported numerical models for film thickness and friction have not been applied under such operating conditions. In this paper a numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been presented to obtain the EHL film behaviour under the usual range of operating conditions of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> Realistic engine torque-speed characteristics are used. For these conditions, the load share per teeth pair contact is in the region of 500 - 6000 N. A suitable method of solution is applied to ease the convergence of the numerical method, namely the distributed line low relaxation effective influence Newton-Raphson method. As the result of the angled direction of the entraining flow in the contact of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> teeth <b>pairs,</b> this method has been found to be suitable, thus adopted.

The optmal head-cutter geometry and machine tool settings are determined to introduce the optimal tooth surface modifications into the teeth of spiral bevel and <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> The aim of these tooth surface modifications is to simultaneously reduce the tooth contact pressure and the transmission errors, to maximize the EHD load carrying capacity of the oil film, and to minimize power losses in the oil film. The proposed advanced method for the manufacture of spiral bevel and <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is based on machine tool setting variation on the cradle-type generator conducted by optimal polynomial functions and {{on the use of}} a CNC hypoid generator.

It is found that the classical jump discontinuity will occur if the dynamic mesh force exceeds the mean value of tooth mesh force. On the other hand, the propensity for the gear response to jump disappears when the dynamic mesh force {{is lower than the}} mean mesh force. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis is able to distinguish the specific tooth impact types from analyzing the behaviors of the dynamic mesh force.

In the automobile differential hypoid gears, high loads result in non-Newtonian behaviour of the lubricant, which may exceed its limiting shear stress, a fact which has not been taken into account in the open literature. This results in conditions which deviate from observed experimental tractive behaviour.

However, the design and manufacturing of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are quite difficult. Currently, the major parameters of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are calculated, but the geometries of the gears are not fully defined. To machine a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear,</b> parameters of cutting systems are determined according to the gear design, whereas, settings of CNC machine tools with the machining parameters are also computed. The existing <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> machining methods use the simplified blade model of the cutting systems, resulting in large errors in the machined gears. This new work proposes an accurate approach, to determine the parameters of the cutting system blades, for the face-milling of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> In this work, a parametric model of the blades is established; and according to the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> parameters, the pressure angle and the cutting system radius are precisely calculated. Currently, <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> engineers can use special CAD/CAM software to design the gears and to calculate machine settings. Unfortunately, these software are developed only for particular machine tools; it cannot be used for <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> machine tools of different configurations.

The time varying geometry and contact characteristics of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> are taken into account by using realistic data available in the literature. The rheological models employed cover a range of two different behaviors: Newtonian and non-Newtonian Eyring (shear thinning).

The boundary friction force is calculated using the Greenwood & Tripp model. Finally, the actual surface topography of a run-in hypoid gear is obtained using a stylus profilometer. The results indicate an overestimation of the viscous friction by the Newtonian model, as opposed with the non-Newtonian model, mainly due to shear thinning effects.

The torsional gear dynamics model takes into account both the geometric non-linearities of the system (backlash non-linearity) as well as the time varying properties (contact radii, meshing stiffness) and the internal excitations caused by geometrical imperfections of the teeth pair (static transmission error). The input torque used {{for the study of the}} film thickness and the sub-surface stress distribution corresponds to the region after the main resonance, where no teeth separation occurs. The contact conditions predicted by the gear dynamics are used as the input for the elastohydrodynamic elliptical point contact analysis. The lubricant film thickness, the corresponding pressure and surface traction distributions are obtained quasi-statically using the output load of the dynamic gear pair model. The variation of the induced sub-surface stress field is determined throughout a meshing cycle. Based on the sub-surface reversing orthogonal shear stresses, marginal differences occur when the viscous shear on the conjunctional surfaces are taken into account, which are mainly influenced by the applied pressure distribution.

It is essentially induced by torque variations. This can be {{as a result of}} resonant conditions or torque fluctuations caused by engine order vibrations, compounded by gear transmission error. The principal mechanism of gear whine noise generation is, therefore, through transmission of vibration from the gear shafts and bearings to the differential housing, which is radiated as noise. Furthermore, interactions between the differential unit, axles and driveshafts often generate excessive tonal noises, which are the result of coupled bending and torsional resonances of assembled components. These resonances induce a magnification effect upon the noise source itself through exciting the gear shafts and distorting the alignment of the gear sets. Axle whine noise has become an important Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) concern, {{because of the nature of}} the noise, further compounded by the human aural system, which is highly sensitive in tonal memory. The result is a continuously increasing warranty costs or use of expensive palliatives to mitigate the phenomenon.

It is shown that the New European Driving Cycle captures the transmission efficiency characteristics of the differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> under worst case scenario, with its underlying implications for fuel efficiency and emissions. However, it fails to address the other key attribute, being the noise, vibration and harshness performance. In the case of hypoid gears, the resultant noise, vibration and harshness characteristics can be particularly annoying. It is concluded that broader transient manoeuvres encompassing New European Driving Cycle are required for assessment, in order to obtain a balanced approach for transmission efficiency and noise, vibration and harshness performance. This approach is undertaken in this article, which is not hitherto reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Digitized <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear’s</b> surface model, {{which is}} {{constructed}} by NURBS method, can set free {{the constraints of}} conventional processing technique {{in the process of}} designing and manufacturing <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear.</b> The digitalization of tooth surfaces of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> consists of three parts: building large gear’s NURBS model, calculating small tooth surface’s character parameters based on actual requirements and small tooth surface’s digitalization. The digitalization of tooth surfaces can be realized by machining simulation, and the key points are how to establish equations of cutter head and grids of gear solid, and how to judge correct trace points in the process of machining simulation. With the aid of digitized model of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear,</b> tooth contact analysis can be accomplished by regular motion of two NURBS tooth surfaces...|$|R

40|$|In general, {{the shaft}} angle of {{automotive}} <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is 90 degrees. Therefore, the design method of an angular <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> {{had not been}} investigated sufficiently up to now. Moreover, the tooth spiral of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is generally on the right hand and the pinion axis is offset below the gear axis. Therefore, when the pinion axis is offset conversely, the design method has not been investigated in detail. In the present report, by using basic equations on the angular <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> with an opposite offset obtained in the previous paper, the design dimensions of the angular <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> whose shaft angle is {{in the region of}} 70 ～ 100 -degrees are shown. As a result, it was found that as the shaft angle increases the pitch angle of the gear increases, but that of the pinion does not so much change and the bias angle which shows the inclination of the tooth bearing changes negatively or positively the sign near the 90 -degree shaft angle on the drive-side tooth surface...|$|R
