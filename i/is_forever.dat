25|$|Carmel Jackson (also Roberts) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Judith Jacob from 5 June 1986 to 24 August 1989. Carmel, a Health Visitor, was initially introduced in a recurring, minor role in 1986. Producers saw {{potential in the}} character, and script writers were asked to develop more prominent storylines, and Carmel became a regular character. She is portrayed as a well-meaning, caring individual who <b>is</b> <b>forever</b> getting everyone's problems dumped on her. She is featured in storylines about domestic violence and various family and career upsets. Jacob remained in the role until 1989, when she opted to leave. Off-screen, the character {{was the subject of}} criticism regarding the portrayal of her profession from the Health Visitors Association.|$|E
25|$|For instance, in Gardner's Win, Lose or Die Bond is {{promoted}} to Captain, but this aspect does not carry over and in Benson's novels have Bond as a Commander {{once again with}} no explanation. Some of Gardner's original recurring characters are also not present, including Ann Reilly (aka Q'ute) who {{by the end of}} Gardner's era had taken over Q Branch from Major Boothroyd; Benson features Major Boothroyd with no explanation. Some of Gardner's changes do remain, for instance, Benson's Bond continues to smoke cigarettes from H. Simmons of Burlington Arcade, which was first introduced in Gardner's For Special Services (1982). Additionally, the Bond girls Fredericka von Grüsse (Never Send Flowers / SeaFire), Harriet Horner (Scorpius), and Easy St. John (Death <b>is</b> <b>Forever)</b> are all mentioned. Further novels by Benson also retain some aspects of Gardner's series though there is equally just as much that he ignores.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter <b>is</b> <b>forever</b> in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E
