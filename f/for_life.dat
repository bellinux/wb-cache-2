5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E
