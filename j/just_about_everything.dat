Bowles wrote that the film has [...] "beautifully choreographed moments, and the action sequences won't disappoint any fans of slow-motion fistfights and arteries that gush like fire hydrants". Independent film critic Emanuel Levy wrote that Crowe's [...] "commanding performance" [...] and his chemistry with Liu lift the film slightly above the routine. Levy said that the film is an [...] "ultra-violent movie that blends thrilling martial arts sequences, orchestrated and executed {{by some of the}} masters of this specific milieu, with a semi-involving tale" [...] that would be appreciated by a young, indiscriminating audience. Leonard Maltin of IndieWire said that [...] "RZA's understated performance isn't bad, but his staging of action leaves something to be desired", and that the film imitates earlier kung-fu films, which it fails to improve upon.|$|E

Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8.6/10, as he thought it [...] "delivered action, suspense, mystery, and the final climax" [...] to Peter discovering his origins, and it was [...] "a great achievement that marks a big turning point for the series". Like other critics, Isler also praised Jackson and Noble's acting. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly lauded Noble and Jackson's performances, calling Peter's change back to [...] "the secretive, bitter, scurrilous character he was before the series started" [...] a [...] "wrenching daring move {{on the part of}} the show".

[...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball.
