40|$|The Seamless Stressometer® roll (Seamless STR) is used {{to measure}} the {{flatness}} of aluminum and steel strip when there is an extreme demand on the surface finish. To protect the roll and strip, the roll is coated with two layers deposited by <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>fueled</b> spraying (HVOF), Cr-Ni(Si,B) closest to the roll and WC-Co on top. This solution has several disadvantages; high cost and complicated logistics, corrosion sensitivity and high residual stresses creates the need for two coatings which in turn complicates the process. Cobalt is, in addition, sensitive to low pH coolants and environmentally unfriendly. These problems have given rise to the idea of switching both the method and material of the coating. In {{the first part of this}} work, <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> air fueled spraying (HVAF) was evaluated as an alternative deposition method. Three materials, Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr, WC-Co and WC-CrC-Ni were deposited on steel coupons with varying chamber pressure, powder feed rate and distance from the nozzle, in order to evaluate if HVAF can be a valid technique for use in this application and to optimize the spraying recipe. The objectives were to get a sufficiently high thickness per sweep, to be able to make the depositions in a manageable number of sweeps, and to get low porosity, since the coatings need to be dense to be hard and possible to polish smooth. The tests showed that all three materials can be sprayed with the high settings on the parameters to obtain coatings that exceeded the set limits of the objectives. In the second part of this work, the recipe obtained from the first part was used to deposit samples for further analysis. The coatings were compared regarding cost, hardness, friction, wear and pick-up properties to evaluate if a switch in material from WC-Co was possible. The coatings showed both similarities and differences. The friction was very similar for the three materials. Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr was substantially cheaper than the other two, had lower hardness and higher porosity, but still probably acceptable values, and was satisfactory regarding wear and pick-up. WC-Co and WC-CrC-Ni were very similar to each other regarding cost, hardness and porosity but WC-Co was the best regarding wear and pick-up, where WC-CrC-Ni was the worst. The only clear advantage of WC-CrC-Ni over WC-Co is the lack of cobalt. Taking everything into consideration, including the fact that the wear and pick-up tests in this work was quite exaggerated, Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr is an interesting option for this application due to its low cost and acceptable test results, WC-Co had the best results but is expensive and contains cobalt and WC-CrC-Ni had as good results as WC-Co except for the wear and pick-up tests and does not contain cobalt...|$|R
