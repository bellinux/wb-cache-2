40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{technology}} {{involving the}} use of water-in-oil-in-water double <b>emulsions</b> (<b>DEs)</b> offers an interesting approach to improve the fat content of foods. With this aim, the effect on frankfurter properties of replacing pork backfat with two different DEs prepared using perilla oil and pork backfat as lipid phases was assessed. This strategy was compared with straightforward addition of the lipid source and addition {{by means of an}} oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. RESULTS: As compared with all-pork-fat frankfurters, the ones with perilla oil had a higher proportion of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Reduced-fat frankfurters had similar water- and fat-binding properties irrespective of the lipid source or the technological strategy used to incorporate it. Moreover, the oil source but not its mode of incorporation determined the oxidation levels of frankfurters. In reduced-fat samples, except in the case of frankfurters formulated with a perilla oil-in-water emulsion, hardness was unaffected either by the type of fat or by its mode of incorporation. The replacement of pork backfat by perilla oil reduced the overall acceptability of products when perilla oil was added by means of the O/W <b>emulsion</b> and <b>DE</b> approaches. CONCLUSION: This technology is suitable for labelling meat products with specific nutritional and health claims. © 2015 Society of Chemical IndustryThis research has been supported by project AGL 2011 - 29644 -C 02 - 01 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

40|$|Olive oil based W/O/W double <b>emulsions</b> (<b>DEs)</b> were {{prepared}} with polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR, 3 or 6 %) and sodium caseinate as emulsifiers both singly in a control sample, {{and with the}} addition of two fat-crystallizers (Verols V 10 or V 50) at two concentrations (3 or 6 %). Globule size distribution was essentially monomodal with area-volume mean diameter (d) values ∼ 2  μm. Creaming along an 8  d refrigerated storage was always minor. The predominant elastic behavior in control samples evolved to viscous in samples with Verols. DSC revealed that V 10 and V 50 crystalized as α- and β′-polymorphs respectively, that can absorb at a W/O interface, potentially producing interfacial crystallization (V 10    V 50) concerning DEs stabilization because V 50 plus 3 or 6 % PGPR produced essentially glassy matrices, thus impeding Pickering effects. V 10 plus 3 or 6 % PGPR formed crystalline DEs with presence of lyotropic mesophases, which yielded W/O Pickering stabilization effects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the type of lipid source (chia oil, sunflower oil, olive oil or rendered pork backfat) on physicochemical properties and riboflavin encapsulation in food-grade W 1 /O/W 2 double <b>emulsions</b> (<b>DE)</b> for use as functional healthier-fat food ingredients. DEs with encapsulated riboflavin were subjected to conventional thermal treatment (70 °C for 30 min) and storage at 4 °C for 8 days to determine their influence on oil droplet particle size characteristics, viscosity, dynamic rheological properties, physical stability and encapsulation efficiency. The thermal treatment caused minimal changes in these parameters. DEs containing rendered pork backfat (DEsRPF) collapsed after 3 days of storage at 4 °C, thus limiting their useful life. For that reason samples of this DEsRPF were stored at room temperature only and proved stable throughout storage in those conditions. Riboflavin was efficiently encapsulated, although the DEs containing chia oil (DEsCO) were the most efficient at the start. However, these DEs released riboflavin progressively during storage at 4 °C. After 8 days' storage at 4 °C, DEsRPF stored at room temperature had encapsulated riboflavin more efficiently than DEs containing oil sources. Overall, DEs were stable to environmental stresses typically occurring in the food industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As a complement to these results, the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by LMWH nanoparticles prepared by two methods [nanoprecipitation (NP) and double <b>emulsion</b> (<b>DE)</b> ] using Eudragit® RS (RS) and poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) have been analysed. Particle sizes varied from 54 to 400 nm with zeta potential values between − 65 and + 63 mV.

Cell viability ranged from 6 % to 100 % depending on the preparation method and physicochemical properties of the particles and the type of toxicity assay. Particle diameter and zeta potential seemed to be the most valuable cytotoxicity markers when cell viability was measured by Trypan blue exclusion and MTT respectively. Nanoparticles prepared by DE were better tolerated than those of NP. LMWH encapsulation into the cationic nanoparticles reduces remarkably their toxicity. Apoptosis evaluation showed activated caspases in exposed cells. However, no nuclear fragmentation was detected in NR 8383 cells whatever the tested nanoparticles.

Emulsions were produced with these proteins and studied by rheology and time domain low-resolution (1) H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (TD-NMR). Extrusion increased storage modulus of rumen protein emulsions. The opposite was observed for soy protein. Mechanical relaxation showed the existence of three relaxing components in the emulsions whose relative contributions were changed by extrusion. Likewise, spin-spin relaxation time constants (T (2)) measured by TD-NMR also showed three major distinct populations of protons in respect to their mobility that were also altered by extrusion. Extrusion increased surface hydrophobicity of both rumen and soy protein. Solubility of rumen protein increased with extrusion whereas soy protein had its solubility decreased after processing. Extrusion promoted molecular reorganization of protein, increasing its superficial hydrophobicity, affecting its interfacial properties and improving its emulsifying behavior.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the oxidative stability of healthier lipid cooked meat systems (MS) in which pork backfat was replaced by a double <b>emulsion</b> (<b>DE,</b> W 1 /O/W 2) prepared with hydroxytyrosol (HXT) within an inner aqueous phase and chia oil as lipid phase. Physical characteristics of DEs and oxidative stability of DEs and MS during chilled storage were analysed. In DEs, which were highly stable, the presence of HXT improved oxidative stability, increasing (P < 0. 05) DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing ability (FRAP) and reducing (P < 0. 05) levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In MS, replacement of pork backfat by chia oil promoted lipid oxidation, which was more pronounced when chia oil was incorporated in the DE than when it was added in liquid form. HXT demonstrated antioxidative capacity, although it was less efficient when incorporated as part of a W 1 /O/W 2 emulsion. In conclusion, MS including DE formulated with chia and HXT display oxidative stability throughout their commercial life, assuring successful development of potential healthier meat products. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract- The use of {{panoramic}} radiography, {{due to its}} numerous advantages, is increasing. Radiographic films used in {{this technique}} are of double <b>emulsion</b> (<b>DE)</b> type which are used with intensifying screens. Single emulsion (SE) films can also be used. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the exposure parameters to achieve an appropriate optical density in these two types of films, and to estimate under such parameters, radiation doses to mandibular bone marrow (MBM), thyroid gland and parotid gland. This study was performed through a tissue equivalent phantom. First, with various tube voltage and tube current, 128 radiographs were taken of phantom with these two types of films. After examining the optical densities, the exposure parameters under which both films have the same density, were determined. Then, phantom again was exposed and MBM, thyroid gland and parotid gland absorbed doses were measured, using TLDs. It was demonstrated that: 1) SE films, in order to provide appropriate optical density, require two times radiation in comparison with double emulsion film; 2) using SE films increases MBM dose, up to 2 - 2. 5 times, thyroid gland dose up to 1. 7 - 2 times and parotid gland dose up to 1. 3 times, in comparison with DE films; 3) in DE films, under lower exposure parameters and desirable processing, MBM dose up to 3. 5 times, thyroid gland dose up to 1. 5 times and parotid gland dose up to 2. 5 times will increase. Considering that the risk of radiation induced cancers increases with repeated radiation doses, using SE films is not recommended...|$|E
40|$|High-throughput {{processing}} technologies hold critical {{position in}} biomedical research. These include screening of cellular response based on phenotypic difference {{and production of}} homogeneous chemicals and biologicals for therapeutic applications. The rapid development of microfluidics technology has provided an efficient, controllable, economical and automatable processing platform for various applications. In particular, emulsion droplet gains {{a lot of attention}} due to its uniformity and ease of isolation, but the application of water-in-oil (W/O) single emulsion is hampered by the presence of the oil phase which is incompatible with aqueous phase manipulation and the difficulty in modifying the droplet environment. This thesis presents the development of a double <b>emulsion</b> (<b>DE)</b> droplet platform in microfluidics and two applications: (1) high-throughput screening of synthetic gene and (2) production of multicellular spheroids with adjustable microenvironment for controlling stem cell differentiation and liver tissue engineering. Monodisperse DE droplets with controllable size and selective permeability across the oil shell were generated via two microfluidics devices after optimization of device design and flow rates. Next, bacterial cells bearing synthetic genes constructed from an inkjet oligonucleotide synthesizer were encapsulated as single cells in DE droplets. Enrichment of fluorescent signals (~ 100 times) from the cells allowed quantification and selection of functionally-correct genes before and after error correction scheme was employed. Permeation of Isopropyl β-D- 1 -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) molecules from the external phase triggered target gene expression of the pET vector. Fluorescent signals from at least ~ 100 bacteria per droplet generated clearly distinguishable fluorescent signals that enabled droplets sorting through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technique. In addition, DE droplets promoted rapid aggregation of mammalian cells into single spheroid in 150 min. Size-tunable human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) spheroids could be extracted from the droplets and exhibited better differentiation potential than cells cultured in monolayer. The droplet environment could be altered by loading matrix molecules in it to create spheroid-encapsulated microgel. As an example, hMSC spheroid was encapsulated in alginate or alginate-RGD microgel and enhanced osteogenic differentiation was found in the latter case. Lastly, the capability of forming spheroids in DE droplet was applied in liver tissue engineering, where single or co-culture hepatocyte spheroids were efficiently produced and encapsulated in microgel. The use of alginate-collagen microgel significantly improved the long-term function of the spheroid, {{in a manner similar to}} forming co-culture spheroids of hepatocytes and endothelial progenitor cells at a 5 to 1 ratio. The hepatocyte spheroid encapsulated in microgel could be useful for developing bioartificial liver or drug testing platform or applied directly for hepatocyte transplantation. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{estimated}} 5 × 10 ³⁰ prokaryotic cells inhabiting {{our planet}} sequester some 350 – 550 Petagrams (1 Pg = 1015 g) of carbon, 85 – 130 Pg of nitrogen, and 9 – 14 Pg of phosphorous, making them the largest reservoir of those nutrients on Earth (Whitman et al. 1998). However, reports suggest that only less than 1 % of these microscopic organisms are cultivable (Torsvik et al. 1990; Sleator et al. 2008). Until recently {{with the development}} of metagenomic techniques, the knowledge of microbial diversity and their metabolic capabilities has been limited to this small fraction of cultivable organisms (Handelsman et al. 1998). While metagenomics has undoubtedly revolutionised the field of microbiology and biotechnology it has been generally acknowledged that the current approaches for metagenomic bio- rospecting / screening have limitations which hinder this approach to fully access the metabolic potentials and genetic variations contained in microbial genomes (Beloqui et al. 2008). In particular, the construction of metagenomic libraries and heterologous expression are amongst the major obstacles. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an ultra-high throughput approach for screening enzyme activities using uncloned metagenomic DNA, thereby eliminating cloning steps, and employing in vitro heterologous expression. To achieve this, three widely used techniques: cell-free transcription-translation, in vitro compartmentalisation (IVC) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) were combined to develop this robust technique called metagenomic in vitro compartmentalisation (mIVC-FACS). Moreover, the E. coli commercial cell-free system was used in parallel to a novel, in-house Rhodococcus erythropolis based cell-free system. The versatility of this technique was tested by identifying novel beta-xylosidase encoding genes derived from a thermophilic compost metagenome. In addition, the efficiency of mIVC-FACS was compared to the traditional metagenomic approaches; function-based (clone library screening) and sequence-based (shotgun sequencing and PCR screening). The results obtained here show that the R. erythropolis cell-free system was over thirty-fold more effective than the E. coli based system based on the number of hits obtained per million double <b>emulsions</b> (<b>dE)</b> droplets screened. Six beta-xylosidase encoding genes were isolated and confirmed from twenty-eight positive dE droplets. Most of the droplets that were isolated from the same gate encoded the same enzyme, indicating that this technique is highly selective. A comparison of the hit rate of this screening approach with the traditional E. coli based fosmid library method shows that mIVC-FACS is at least 2. 5 times more sensitive. Although only a few hits from the mIVC-FACS screening were selected for confirmation of beta-xylosidase activity, the proposed hit rate suggests that a significant number of positive hits are left un-accessed through the traditional clone library screening system. In addition, these results also suggest that E. coli expression system might be intrinsically sub-optimal for screening for hemicellulases from environmental genomes compared to R. erythropolis system. The workflow required for screening one million clones in a fosmid library was estimated to be about 320 hours compared to 144 hours required via the mIVC-FACS screening platform. Some of the gene products obtained in both screening platforms show multiple substrate activities, suggesting that the microbial consortia of composting material consist of microorganisms that produce enzymes with multiple lignocellulytic activities. While this platform still requires optimisation, we have demonstrated that this technique can be used to isolate genes encoding enzymes from mixed microbial genomes. mIVC-FACS is a promising technology with the potential to take metagenomic studies to the second generation of novel natural products bio-prospecting. The astonishing sensitivity and ultra-high throughput capacity of this technology offer numerous advantages in metagenomic bio-prospecting. National Research Foundation (NRF...|$|R

40|$|Liposomes {{offer an}} ideal {{platform}} for the delivery of subunit vaccines, due to their versatility and flexibility, which allows for antigen as well as immunostimulatory lipids and TLR agonists to become associated with these bilayered vesicles. Liposomes {{have the ability to}} protect vaccine antigen, as well as enhance delivery to antigen presenting cells, whilst the importance of cationic surface charge for delivery of TB subunit vaccines and formation of an ‘antigen depot’ may {{play a key role in}} boosting cell-mediated immunity and Th 1 immune responses. The rational design of vaccine adjuvants requires the thorough investigation into the physicochemical characteristics that dictate the function of a liposomal adjuvant. Within this thesis, physicochemical characteristics were investigated in order to show any effects on the biodistribution profiles and the ensuing immune responses of these formulations. Initially the role of liposome charge within the formulation was investigated and subsequently their efficacy as vaccine adjuvants in combination with their biodistribution was measured to allow the role of formulation in vaccine function to be considered. These results showed that cationic surface charge, in combination with high loading of H 56 vaccine antigen through electrostatic binding, was crucial in the promotion of the ‘depot-effect’ at the injection site which increases the initiation of Th 1 cell-mediated immune responses that are required to offer protection against tuberculosis. To further investigate this, different methods of liposome production were also investigated where antigen incorporation within the vesicles as well as surface adsorption were adopted. Using the dehydration-rehydration (DRV) method (where liposomes are freeze-dried in the presence of antigen to promote antigen encapsulation) and the double <b>emulsion</b> (<b>DE)</b> method, a range of liposomes entrapping antigen were formulated. Variation in the liposome preparation method can lead to antigen entrapment within the delivery system which has been shown to be greater for DRV-formulated liposomes compared to their DE-counterparts. This resulted in no significant effect on the vaccine biodistribution profile, as well as not significantly altering the efficacy of cationic liposomal adjuvants. To further enhance the efficacy of these systems, the addition of TLR agonists either at the vesicle surface as well as within the delivery system has been displayed through variation in the preparation method. Anionic liposomal adjuvants have been formulated, which displayed rapid drainage from the injection site to the draining lymph nodes and displayed a reduction in measured Th 1 immune responses. However, variation in the preparation method can alter the immune response profile for anionic liposomal adjuvants with a bias in immune response to Th 2 responses being noted. Through the use of high shear mixing and stepwise incorporation, the efficient loading of TLR agonist within liposomes has been shown. However, interestingly the conjugation between lipid and non-electrostatically bound TLR agonist, followed by insertion into the bilayer of DDA/TDB resulted in localised agonist retention at the injection site and further stimulation of the Th 1 immune response at the SOI, spleen and draining lymphatics as well as enhanced antibody titres...|$|E

At 10 % (w/v) emulsifier to oil ratio, emulsions stabilized with gum arabic, starch and SPI had average oil droplet sizes lower than 1 µm. Increasing the oil content by two-fold (emulsifier/oil ratio of 10 : 20), increased the average droplet size of the gum arabic and SPI emulsions to 1. 5 and 4. 2 mm, respectively, while that of the starch emulsion remained unchanged. At 5 % oil concentration, gum tragacanth and carrageenan stabilized emulsions yielded two average droplet sizes of 0. 5 µm (52. 7 %) and 1. 8 µm (46. 5 %), and 0. 5 µm (48. 8 %) and 1. 7 µm (46. 6 %), respectively.

LBL interfacial formation was confirmed by charge reversal in ζ-potential. Depletion flocculation occurred in LBL systems but deflocculation was possible in systems with sufficient primary layer. Coalescence was observed in systems with insufficient primary layer. Systems with higher amount of primary layer and total solids contents exhibited the highest stability against creaming. High total solids (45 - 50 %) SL and LBL emulsions were successfully spray dried to give free flowing powders with differences in critical powder characteristics. Carotenoids degradation followed first order kinetics and increased with storage temperature but was less rapid in dehydrated LBL emulsions. Two-step degradation kinetics displaying rapid initial decrease followed by a second slower degradation was observed in spray dried systems. There was non-Arrhenian increase in carotenoids degradation with increasing storage temperature during the rapid initial degradation in spray dried emulsions and in freeze-dried emulsions. Carotenoids retention was higher in LBL systems upon long term storage.

40|$|Advanced {{control is}} {{becoming}} imperative for various processes, and polymerization processes are absolutely no exception. The major objectives of on-line {{monitoring and control}} of polymerization processes are maintaining the process safety, manufacturing polymers with well-defined properties, and reducing costs. Polymers are found in a large variety of products. It is a well accepted fact that a significant quantity of polymers are manufactured in emulsion polymerization, and that the economic importance of these products is beyond question. The reaction medium in emulsion polymerization involves the dispersion {{of one or more}} monomers (which are usually partially or totally hydrophobic) in a continuous aqueous phase* with a water soluble initiator and an emulsifier. The reaction therefore takes place under heterogeneous conditions, and the final product, called a latex, consists of suspended polymer particles in water, stabilized by the emulsifier. Industrial emulsion polymerization processes can be classified into two groups according to the final use of the latex. In some emulsion polymerization processes the produced latex is an intermediate product, and it is coagulated after the fact to give the final bulk polymer (e. g. polyvinyl chloride, styrene butadiene rubber). In other processes, the produced polymer is used directly (or perhaps after some intermediate formulation steps) {{in the form of a}} latex. Polymers produced in this way are used as water-based paints (acrylics lattices), adhesives (polyvinyl acetate latex), and finishes for textiles, paper or leather (acrylic polymers). * Of course not all emulsions use water as the continuous phase. Water-in-oil, or inverse processes also exist. However, we will limit our discussion to the more common oil-in-water processes. The final latex properties depend on the polymer molecular weight distribution, particle size distribution, morphology, glass transition temperature, and composition (when several monomers are used). These properties are strongly determined by the amount and type of additives, initiator, emulsifier and chain transfer agent, the monomer addition policy, the reaction temperature and the reactor configuration. Hence, emulsion polymerization processes are characterized by a large number of manipulated variables, which means that, in order to describe the relationships between them, we would need highly complex process model. In order to ensure the economical production of a polymer with the desired properties under safe conditions, important decisions must usually be made during plant operation, by means of automatic on-line control. In the context of control, the process is a dynamic system (described by a set of differential equations) with well-known inputs (that can usually be used as manipulated variables), process 'states' that are the variables representing the evolution of the process, and finally measured process outputs (which are usually a combination of the process states). Control of the process states is based on a suitable process model. It also requires some on-line state measurements. In spite of the importance of emulsion polymerization, process control is still a particularly difficult task. The difficulties in controlling emulsion polymerization are often associated with the lack of on-line measurements of several properties, the high reaction rate, the sensitivity of the reaction to small amounts of additives, and the highly complex reaction networks that result in a complex nonlinear model combined with a number of unknown variables. One of the main control objectives in an emulsion polymerization process is to track polymer composition. This is of absolute importance in terms of final properties of the produced polymer-e. g. glass transition temperature, particle morphology, mechanical and chemical resistances. Controlling polymer composition is indispensable if several monomers with different reactivity ratios are involved in the reaction at a nonazeotropic monomer composition, which is the case of most industrial systems. If no control action is taken in this case, the polymer composition will vary during the reaction, and this will lead to a heterogeneity in the polymer properties (unless the polymer is made in a CSTR). Polymer composition can however be controlled by employing appropriate monomer feed flow rates. The most efficient monomer addition policy, in terms of composition control and simultaneous minimization of process time consists of applying a variable monomer feed flow rate of the more reactive monomer(s), that should be a function of the residual amount of monomer remaining in the reactor and their reactivity ratios. Therefore, controlling polymer composition requires on-line measurement of the polymer composition and the instantaneous quantity of residual monomers, an adequate mathematical model correlating the monomer feed flow rates with the produced polymer composition (inputs-outputs), and finally the use of a robust control technique. On-line sensors developed for the direct monitoring of emulsion polymerization can be classified into two broad categories: sensors that require a sampling device or a circulating loop to perform the analysis (e. g. gas chromatography and densimetry), and in situ sensors (e. g. Spectroscopic and ultrasonic probes). The copolymer composition can be monitored by means of on-line gas chromatography (based on the analysis of the residual monomer), or by densimetry (if combined with an additional sensor). However, the measurements in these sensors present some difficulties related to the latex sampling and treatment, and sometimes, time delays caused by long analysis times. This is not to say that we cannot use these sensors, by rather we must be aware of their limitations. In the second category, the analysis is performed in the reactor, and therefore problems related to time delays and to plugging of the sampling loop are minimized. However, some sensors such as the infrared spectroscopy, while very promising, are still in the stage of development, and we are still faced with the problem of coagulation on the sensor. When these techniques become available, they will provide valuable information on the state of the reactor. Nevertheless, given the complicated nature of emulsion systems, we will still need to apply advanced control strategies such as those outlined in what follows. Due to the difficulty of performing on-line measurements of all the states of the process, combined with a lack of accurate phenomenological models, estimation techniques have been developed to infer estimates of certain variables that are not available on-line, from auxiliary measurements. State observers, or software sensors, are designed based on the process model and on the process outputs. If the observability conditions are satisfied, the observer reconstructs some of the unmeasurable states of the model from the available measurements. Good state observers can overcome modeling uncertainties and measurement noise, and are therefore useful for process monitoring, control, fault detection, and are also used as filters of random effects associated to the measurements. Despite the highly nonlinear behavior of the polymerization process, mainly due to the reaction rate, linear estimation (e. g. Kalman filter) techniques have usually been used to infer information about the evolution of several unmeasurable states of the process. Similarly, linear control techniques (PID, adaptive) have usually been applied to track several variables of the linearized nonlinear system. This is due to the difficulty of dealing with nonlinear systems and to the fact that nonlinear estimators are usually restricted to a class of nonlinear systems. However, linear estimation and control techniques are inadequate for highly nonlinear processes. Nowadays, recent developments in nonlinear theory allow us to implement nonlinear estimation (e. g. high gain observer) and control (e. g. geometric control) techniques to several classes of systems without extensive calculations. The main objective of this research is to apply such nonlinear techniques to estimate and control the polymer composition, and to maximize the process productivity under safe reactor operation. The fundamental on-line information about the evolution of the process is obtained by calorimetry. Calorimetry is often useful in vinyl polymerization reactions, since they tend to be very exothermic. On an industrial level, the main use of calorimetry is currently reactor safety (by reactor temperature control), and the estimation of the rate of heat produced by the polymerization, which is proportional to the overall reaction rate. In Chapter 2 we will review the theoretical nonlinear estimation and control techniques that will be used throughout this research. Calorimetry will be discussed in Chapter 3. The observer development to estimate the polymer composition in co- and terpolymerization processes is presented in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 6, we develop a control strategy for polymer composition for both co- and terpolymerization processes. Finally, in Chapter 7, we treat the topic "Maximizing productivity under safe conditions", where the polymer composition is controlled and the reaction rate is simultaneously maintained at a predefined maximum limit. La nécessité de produire des polymères avec des propriétés spécifiques et reproductibles, de minimiser le temps et les coûts et de contrôler la sécurité de l'expérience nous contraint à utiliser des méthodes avancées de contrôle de procédés de polymérisation.
