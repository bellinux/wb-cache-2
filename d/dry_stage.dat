40|$|Abstract: Constant-temperature drying {{tests for}} cotton straw under {{different}} conditions were performed with an integrated thermal analyzer, {{and the influence}} of different drying conditions on the drying process was analyzed. The process was divided into preheating <b>stage,</b> constant-rate <b>drying</b> <b>stage,</b> and decelerating <b>drying</b> <b>stage.</b> Regression analysis was conducted for drying curves at the latter two stages, and then the drying time at the critical point was determined. Regression equations of drying rate at these stages were produced. Research results showed that the decelerating <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> of cotton straw included two decelerating intervals, and the best ending point of the drying of the cotton straw that had an initial moisture content of 56. 1 % and a drying temperature of 100 ˚Cwas 600 s, thus providing experimental data and reference for research on drying technology of straws...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{was used to}} measure moisture profiles during non-isothermal drying of fired-clay brick. Drying was induced by a temperature gradient resulting from one-sided heating. A saturated fired-clay brick sample which was closed and isolated on all sides except for the front surface was heated with a halogen lamp of variable intensity. By measuring the moisture profiles in time it was possible to identify two distinct <b>drying</b> <b>stages.</b> In the first <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> homogeneous <b>drying</b> is observed. When the critical moisture content is reached a drying front enters the sample. The characteristic time t 0 after which this drying front develops depends on the applied heat flux. The total amount of energy needed for evaporation of the moisture in the first <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> is found to be independent of the heat flux from the lamp. As a result the total amount of moisture as a function of time can be scaled to one master curve using the time t 0. The data from these measurements provided an interesting view on drying processes, not only under isothermal conditions but also under influence of a thermal gradient. By using the power input as a scaling parameter it is shown that both the total mass and the drying front positions as a function of time show the same behaviour in all experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of the first drying period is usually demonstrated by the observation of a constant <b>drying</b> rate <b>stage.</b> However, with highly deformable materials, the overall drying rate is misleading due to the substantial decrease of the exchange surface. The drying flux is a more useful quantity to consider, but it requires both the exchange surface area and the overall drying rate to be determined during the entire drying process. Another proof of evidence of a first <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> lies in the sample temperature, which should stay equal to the wet bulb temperature during the first drying period. In this paper, we proposed a new experimental set-up that allows the {{existence of}} a first <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> to be proved by two independent experimental data. Using a climatic chamber, a microbalance and two contactless methods (two laser beam micrometers and an infrared thermometer) the sample dimensions, the drying rate and the surface temperature can be collected simultaneously versus time.

Narava procesa nam omogoča odstranjevanje vode iz produktov, ne da je snov izpostavljena visokim temperaturam, ki lahko uničijo lastnosti produkta. To je en temeljnih procesov pri procesiranju farmacevtskih produktov in prehrane, ki ima velik vpliv na njihovo stabilnost in obstojnost hranjenja.

Decomposition processes and beetle succession were analysed on rabbit carcasses in three different habitats (agricultural, desert and urban) in the period from May to July 2014. Due to the effects of the high temperature at the study sites, carrion reached the <b>dry</b> <b>stage</b> within 12  days in the agricultural habitat, and 6  days in the desert and urban habitats. A total of 125 beetles belonging to eight species and five families were collected during the decaying process, with their abundances increasing from the fresh to decay stages. The prevailing species belonged to the families of Dermestidae and Histeridae. It was not possible to confirm any definitive relationship between the occurrence of a single species and a particular stage of decomposition. The beetle communities were also not distinctively different between desert and urban habitats, but a distinct community was evident in the agriculture habitat. In addition, there were distinct beetle communities between the decay stage and the other stages. The <b>dry</b> <b>stage</b> recorded the lowest number of beetles.

30|$|When panel {{products}} absorb moisture, {{either in}} vapor or liquid form, overall TS occurs {{both from the}} swelling of the particles themselves and the springback [30, 31]. Particle swelling occurs because wood, from which the particles are made, is naturally hygroscopic. Furthermore, absorbed moisture could cause bond breakage and bring about particle separation. Springback {{is a result of}} releasing the stress of the board, which is caused by the compression of pressing. Nevertheless, when a board desorbs moisture and returns to a <b>dry</b> <b>stage,</b> there is part of the overall swelling never recovers to its original form.

Place and Duration of Study: UNIBEN Kilishi factory, University of Benin, Edo, Nigeria; Food Processing Laboratory, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria between December 2014 and June 2015. Methodology: The independent variables for the first <b>drying</b> <b>stage</b> were meat thickness (3 mm – 5 mm), drying temperature (40 – 60 °C) and drying time (3 – 5 h) with moisture loss being the response. For the infusion-second <b>stage</b> <b>drying,</b> the independent variables were ingredient concentration (50 – 70 %), infusion time (20 – 40 min), drying temperature (40 - 60 °C) and drying time (4 – 6 h) while the response was apparent yield.

Results: The optimum conditions for first <b>stage</b> <b>drying</b> were 3 mm meat thickness, 60 °C drying temperature and a drying time of 3 h, with an optimum moisture loss of 63. 19 %.
