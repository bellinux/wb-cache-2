In a meta-review of studies claiming that beaver dams act as fish passage barriers, Kemp et al. found that 78% of these claims were not supported by any data.

Both adults and juveniles of coho salmon, steelhead trout, sea run cutthroat (Oncorhyncus clarki clarki), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma malma), and sockeye salmon are able to cross beaver dams. In southeast Alaska, coho jumped dams as high as two meters, were found above all beaver dams and had their highest densities in streams with beaver. In Oregon coastal streams, beaver dams are ephemeral and almost all wash out in high winter flows only to be rebuilt every summer.

40|$|Telemetry {{was used}} to examine {{spawning}} migration of sea trout, Salmo trutta L. (n = 126), in two rivers in northern Sweden. The spawning areas defined by radio-tagged fish differed between the river systems. In the River Vindelaelven, sea trout spawned in the main stem and 80 % of tagged individuals returned to areas where hatchery-reared juveniles had been previously stocked. In the River Piteaelven, 74 % of tagged sea trout ascended tributaries for spawning. Tagged fish were categorised into three groups of migratory pattern. CART (classification and regression tree) analysis indicated that distance from tagging location to spawning site (Sdist) explained the migratory patterns. Large Sdist separated fish with stepwise upstream migration from those with up- and <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations</b> and one-directional direct migration.

50|$|Bank erosion at cutbanks on {{the outside}} of meanders {{combined}} with deposition of point bars on the inside of meanders cause channel migration. The greatest bank erosion often occurs just downstream of the meander apex, causing <b>downstream</b> <b>migration</b> as the high velocity flow eats away at the bank as it is forced around the meander curve. Avulsion is another process of channel migration that occurs much more rapidly than the gradual migration process of cutbank erosion and point bar deposition. Avulsion occurs when lateral migration causes two meanders to become so close that the river bank between them is breached, causing the joining of the meanders and the creation of two channels. When the original channel is cut off from the new channel by the deposition of sediments, oxbow lakes are formed.

Equal numbers of fish undertook post-spawning upstream return migrations during flow pulses and during regulated baseflow conditions, with regulated baseflow migrants exhibiting a preference for dusk–dawn passage through freshwater pool–riffle sequences. The median magnitude of flow pulses at the time of commencement of downstream and upstream freshwater migrations by Australian bass was not large, equivalent to natural (in the absence of river regulation) flows equalled or exceeded for 56 % and 48 % of time, respectively. There was no evidence for increased numbers of migrants with increasing flow pulse magnitude, with individual fish ignoring some flow pulses but responding to subsequent events. In regulated rivers, the release of more frequent flow pulses with peak magnitudes approximating the natural 50 th flow duration percentile may be more effective in stimulating greater numbers of Australian bass to undertake pre-spawning and post-spawning migrations between freshwater and estuarine habitats than the release of a single, larger event. The propensity of Australian bass to also undertake spawning migrations under regulated baseflow conditions emphasizes the need for provision of baseflow regimes in regulated rivers that can facilitate migrations by large bodied fishes...|$|R

50|$|Migration downriver is also {{problematic}} after dams are built. Pre-dam currents on the Columbia efficiently carried fry to the ocean, but {{the introduction}} of dams and reservoirs changed {{the flow of the}} river, forcing the young fish to exert much more energy to swim through slack waters. In addition, many fish are killed by the dam turbines as they try to swim further downstream. It is unclear exactly how many fish are killed in the turbines, but old estimates range between 8-12% per dam. If a fish hatches high upstream they will have to swim through multiple dams, leading to possible cumulative losses of over 50-80% of the migrating fry. Efforts to make turbines safer for fish to pass through have significantly reduced fish loses to near pre-dam levels. While hatcheries appear to be quite successful for some species of fish, their efforts to increase fish populations will not be effective until up and <b>downstream</b> <b>migration</b> is improved. There is no one solution to improving the salmon and trout populations on the Columbia as it is the cumulative effects of the dams, slack-water reservoirs, loss of habitat, pollution, and overfishing that are killing the fish.From 1965 to 1969, 27, 312 acres were logged along the Columbia River to remove timber from the new flood plain. The slashing of vegetation along the shoreline weakened soil stability and made the land susceptible to wind erosion, creating sandstorms. Conversely, in wet periods, the cleared areas turned into vast mud flats.|$|E

50|$|Beaver ponds {{have been}} shown to have a {{beneficial}} effect on trout and salmon populations; in fact, many authors believe that the decline of salmonid fishes is related to the decline in beaver populations. A study of small streams in Sweden found that brown trout in beaver ponds were larger than those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. These findings are similar to several studies of beaver effects on fish in North America. Brook trout, coho, and sockeye salmon were significantly larger in beaver ponds than those in unimpounded stream sections in Colorado and Alaska. In addition, research in the Stillaguamish River basin in Washington found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity.

Two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond. The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important (and underappreciated) in streams without deep pools or where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams. A 2003 study showed that Atlantic salmon and sea trout (S. trutta morpha trutta) spawning in the Numedalslågen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway were unhindered by beaver. In Norway, beaver dams are considered beneficial for brown and sea trout populations (these are potamodromous and anadromous forms of the same species). There, beaver ponds produce increased food for young fish and provide refuges for large adults heading upstream to spawn.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Yukon River is {{the fourth}} largest river in North America, yet the ecology of its fishes has not been well described. During {{the spring and summer}} of 2002 – 04, we sampled the <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations</b> of fishes in the Yukon River mainstem near the Canada-U. S. border, using a rotary auger trap. Age- 0 {{juvenile}} chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, were the most common fish in the catch, and they peaked in abundance in mid-June. Smaller numbers of age- 1 chinook salmon and age- 0 chum salmon, O. keta, were caught earlier in the season. Over 80 % of the remaining catch consisted of young-of-the-year Coregoninae (whitefish), presumably moving from natal areas to summer rearing habitats. Few adult whitefish were captured, probably because our sampling terminated before fall spawning migrations began. Both juveniles and adults were captured for six other winter or spring spawning species that we encountered. Our results indicate that the Yukon River mainstem is used extensively as a migration corridor. This reach of the mainstem has very high suspended sediment levels in summer; its significance as rearing habitat remains unknown. Further studies are required to delineate the extent of migrations and the population structure for the non-anadromous species...|$|R

The principal site for MR-cell distribution shifts from the yolk-sac membrane and body skin during the embryonic stages to the gills in larval and later developmental stages, although the timing of the shift differs in different species. In euryhaline teleosts, MR cells alter their morphology and ion-transporting functions to meet unexpected environmental salinity changes, whereas alteration of MR-cell functions takes place as a preadaptive response for the forthcoming upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations</b> in diadromous teleosts. In stenohaline teleosts inhabiting either freshwater or seawater, on the other hand, MR cells do not possess the functional plasticity to switch the direction of ion transport, but merely adjust the degree of unidirectional ion transport.

40|$|The Mekong fish {{communities}} are characterised by high diversity of fish species with many exhibiting complex life cycles that involve migration between {{different areas of}} the river, particularly upstream migration to spawning areas. The general understanding of migration patterns in the Mekong is that there are three main groupings: the lower zone below Khone Falls, the zone upstream from the falls to Vientiane and the third zone upstream of Vientiane (See Annex 1 Figure 4). However, there are also a number of species that migrate between these zones, and potentially some species (possibly as many as 30 and often commercially valuable white fishes) that migrate longer distances. To complete these migrations requires unobstructed passage upstream, as well as the capacity for adults, larvae and juveniles to migrate or drift downstream. The timing of these upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations</b> is variable depending on life cycles, but importantly, there appears to be continuous spawning in the river with peaks, during the spring (February‐March) as the most important, followed by the onset of the flood (June‐July) and then when the water is receding (November).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{migration}} of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L.) and sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) before, during and after spawning in two northern Swedish rivers and influence of habitats and environmental factors on these activities. In addition, genetic structure of brown trout and genetic impact of stocked salmon and sea trout juveniles from foreign populations on native stocks was studied. Migrations and genetics are related to anthropogenic factors as historical log-floating and hydropower production. On their spawning migration, radio-tagged salmon (n= 128) and sea trout (n= 86) showed that salmon mainly migrated directly to their spawning area, while sea trout exhibited several up- and <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations.</b> Migration speeds was lowered or delayed at steep sections and was higher (25 kmd- 1) later in the migration period compared to early in the run (8 kmd- 1) and negatively correlated with water flow. Salmon and sea trout spawned in the main stem in the river Vindelälven, 230 km and 60 km upstream, respectively, while sea trout in the river Piteälven spawned in various tributaries. A majority (90 %) of the sea trout survived after spawning and overwintered in the rivers. These kelts migrated seaward in spring at water temperatures of 4 – 6 °C whereafter 69 % and 25 % was lost at power-station passage in the rivers Vindelälven and Piteälven, respectively. Genetic differentiation among brown trout with different life histories was high (FST= 0. 09) while weak differentiation among sea migrating populations was revealed (maximum FST of 0. 03). There was no correlation between genetic and geographic distance among all samples while among samples within the Vindelälven such relationship was significant. Within the Piteälven a subpopulation of sea trout was found in one tributary. Genetic assignment supported that tagged sea trout was homing to this stream. Despite longterm stocking of foreign salmon stocks in the river Sävarån mixed-stock analysis were unable to detect genetic introgression. Likewise, genetic impact of stocking sea trout in the Sävarån seemed low, however, with overlap in genotypes genetic introgression could not be ruled out.

An acoustic telemetry array was used to monitor 33 estuary perch, Macquaria colonorum and 39 Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata in the freshwater and estuarine reaches on the Shoalhaven River, south-east Australia. On average, tagged M. novemaculeata were detected for a considerably shorter period than M. colonorum, and evidence suggested that fishing pressure may have impacted on their survival. Macquaria colonorum displayed significant shifts in seasonal and size-related habitat use, with fish predominantly residing in deep (3 ̆e 5 m) areas within the middle (mesohaline) reaches of the estuary during the austral spring to autumn months. In winter, M. colonorum individuals made frequent <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations,</b> often to localised areas, within the lower estuary (LE). In contrast, M. novemaculeata were distributed in shallow (m) habitats throughout the year, within the upper (oligohaline) estuarine reaches of the river, as well as in fresh water. Like M. colonorum, M. novemaculeata made extensive downstream and upstream movements, often coincident with reproductive behaviour, water temperature and increased freshwater inflows. It is postulated that the high site fidelity and repetitive homing displayed by both species is influenced by ontogenetic behaviour and prey availability. Furthermore, the extent of instream distribution by both species, and the lack of observed annual spawning migrations by some M. novemaculeata individuals, indicates the once considered 2 ̆ 7 catadromous 2 ̆ 7 life cycle of these fishes may not be obligatory. A management approach is recommended to ensure that both these species are not over-exploited within a portion of their instream range, thus maintaining their full reproductive potential...|$|R
40|$|The fall <b>downstream</b> <b>migrations</b> of {{juvenile}} American shad Alosa sapidissima and blueback herring Alosa aestivalis were monitored for 3 {{years in the}} Connecticut River at Holyoke Dam, Massachusetts. Decreasing water temperature—not increasing river flow—determined the time migration began and ended for both species. The migration of blueback herring began in September as water temperature declined to 21 °C, peaked at 15 – 14 °C, and ended in late October or early November at 10 °C. The American shad migration began at 19 °C, peaked at 14 – 9 °C, and ended at 10 – 8 °C. Most movement peaks were centered on quarter-moon periods; seven were centered on a new moon and none was centered on a full moon. The diel pattern of migration varied among the 3 years. In general, however, blueback herring were active throughout the 24 -h period (peak activity at 1800 hours), and American shad moved {{in the afternoon and}} evening (peak activity between 1800 and 2200 hours). The migration {{of juvenile}} American shad may be mediated by decreasing temperature such that, as a threshold of 19 °C is reached in the fall, the behavioral tendency to maintain position against the current in low light or at night is curtailed and the juveniles drift downstream. Sex ratios of American shad were not 1 : 1; females dominated in 1980 and males in 1981 and 1982. Sex ratios of blueback herring were 1 : 1 in 1980 and 1981, but males significantly outnumbered females in 1982. The mean total fish lengths increased significantly {{during the course of the}} migration for American shad in 1982 and for blueback herring in 1981...|$|R
5000|$|An {{evaluation}} of potential impacts of mainstream hydropower dams on Mekong fisheries, {{published by the}} Mekong River Commission in 1994, noted that the Sambor project would block upstream and <b>downstream</b> fish <b>migration.</b> Given that the Tonle Sap fisheries are of vital importance to the Cambodian people and economy, contributing approximately 60% towards Cambodia's annual fish landings, the Sambor and other planned mainstream dams on the Mekong {{have important implications for}} the country. [...] A recent policy brief by the WorldFish Center and the Cambodian National Mekong Committee points to the serious impacts dams could have on Cambodia's fisheries and on the fisheries in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam as a result of reduced river flows, and the 'flattening out' of the river's flood pulse.|$|R
