40|$|Evidence from self-consistent {{solar system}} n-body {{simulations}} {{is presented to}} argue that the Earth-Moon system (EM) plays an important dynamical role in the inner solar system, stabilizing the orbits of Venus and Mercury by suppressing a strong secular resonance of period 8. 1 Myr near VenusÏs helio-centric distance. The EM thus appears to play a kind of “ “ gravitational keystone ÏÏ role in the terrestrial precinct, for without it, the orbits of Venus and Mercury become immediately destabilized. The mecha-nism of the resonance, driven by the giant planets, is described. Approximate limits are provided for the mass and heliocentric distance required of EM to perform this role, and results from several additional empirical tests are reported.

40|$|The {{performance}} of thermoelectric (TE) materials has improved tremendously {{over the past}} decade. The intrinsic thermal and electrical properties of state-of-the-art TE materials demonstrate that the potential for widespread practical TE applications is very large and includes TE generators (TEGs) for automotive waste heat recovery. TE materials for automotive TEG applications must have good intrinsic performance, be thermomechanically compatible and be chemically stable in the 400 K to 850 K temperature range. Both n-type and p-type varieties must be available at low cost, easily fabricated and durable. They must also form robust junctions and develop good interfaces with other materials to permit efficient flows of electrical and thermal energy. Among the TE materials of interest for automotive waste heat recovery systems are the skutterudite compounds, which are the antimony-based transition-metal compounds RTE 4 Sb 12, where R can be an alkali metal (e. g., Na, K), alkal ine <b>earth</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Ba), or rare <b>earth</b> (<b>e.</b> g., La, Ce, Yb) and TE can be a transition metal (e. g., Co, Fe). We synthesized a considerable quantity of n-type and p-type skutterudites, fabricated TE modules, incorporated these modules into a prototype TEG and tested the TEG on a production General Motors (GM) vehicle. We discuss our progress on skutterudite TE module fabrication and present module performance data for electrical power output under simulated operating conditions for automotive waste heat recovery systems. We also present preliminary durability results on our skutterudite modules...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{simulation}} of planetary motions {{in the solar}} has been accomplished. This study aims at simulating the planetary motions to know planets’ velocity and position, proving Kepler's second law of the elliptical trajectory and energy owned by planets while orbiting, determining the orbit of Helly comet, and determining the perihelion state of planets. The method {{used in this study}} was based on Newton's equation of motions. By using the Euler approach, a complete picture about the motion of planets rounding the sun was then obtained. Euler method was used considering its simplicity and reliability, although it needed to choose a small-enough step size. However, by the presence of computer technology offering the adequate velocity of calculation, the problem could be overcome. Results obtained from this study included: (1) the velocity and position of planets changed periodically and could be used to determine the travel period of planets, (2) the planets’ ellip-shaped orbit trajectory as indicated by the eccentricity’s price was not equal to zero, for the <b>earth</b> <b>e</b> = 0. 042382, (3) energy owned by the planet was constant, to the <b>earth</b> <b>E</b> = - 19 598 EU AU 2 / year and the angular momentum Lz = AU 2 = 6. 3 EU / year, and (4) Mercury had the perihelion shift, also data of the major axis = 0. 784655, the minor axis = 0. 769402 and the eccentricity = 0. 196215.

We examine the dynamical evolution of the Earth-Moon system from such initial conÐgurations. We Ðnd that during the early evolution of the system, strong orbital resonances are encountered. Passage through these resonances can excite large lunar orbital eccentricity and modify the inclination of the Moon to the equator. Scenarios that resolve the mutual inclination problem are presented. A period of large lunar eccentricity would result in substantial tidal heating in the early Moon, providing a heat source for the lunar magma ocean.

40|$|Cryptochromes are flavin-based photoreceptors {{occurring}} {{throughout the}} biological kingdom, which regulate {{growth and development}} in plants and {{are involved in the}} entrainment of circadian rhythms of both plants and animals. A number of recent theoretical works suggest that cryptochromes might also be the receptors responsible for the sensing of the magnetic field of the <b>earth</b> (<b>e.</b> g. in insects, migratory birds, or migratory fish). Cryptochromes undergo forward light-induced reactions involving electron transfer to excited state flavin to generate radical intermediates, which correlate with biological activity. Here, we give evidence of a mechanism for the reverse reaction, namely dark reoxidation of protein-bound flavin in Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome (AtCRY 1) by molecular oxygen that involves formation of a spin-correlated FADH•–superoxide radical pair. Formation of analogous radical pairs in animal cryptochromes might enable them to function as magnetoreceptors...|$|R

40|$|Rare earths {{are widely}} applied in Chinese {{agriculture}} to improve crop nutrition {{through the use}} of fertilizers, yet little is known of their accumulation in field-grown crops. We have studied the distribution of 16 rare earths (Sc, Y and 14 lanthanide elements) in field-grown maize and the concentration of heavy metals in the grains after application of rare earth-containing fertilizer. When maize entered the vigorous vegetation growth stage (e. g. early stem-elongation stage), rare earth-containing fertilizer was applied to the soil with irrigation water. At 10 days after application of the rare earths, significantly dose-dependent accumulative effects of individual rare earth concentrations in the roots and the plant tops of maize were observed, with the exception of Sc and Lu. At the level of 2 kg rare earths ha(- 1), accumulative concentrations of most light rare <b>earths</b> (<b>e.</b> g. La, Ce, Pr and Nd) and Gd in the plant tops were much larger than those in the control. Concentrations of individual rare earths in a field-grown maize after application of rare earths decreased in the order of root much greater than leaf > stem > grain. During the maize growth period, selective accumulation of individual rare <b>earths</b> (<b>e.</b> g. La, Ce) in the roots seemed to be in dynamic equilibrium, and the distribution of these elements in the plant tops was variable. At a dosage of less than 10 kg rare earths ha(- 1), no apparent accumulative concentrations of individual rare earths appeared in the maize grains. Under the experimental conditions, application of rare earth-containing fertilizer did not induce an increase in the concentrations of heavy metals in the grains. We conclude that the present dosage of rare earths (< 0. 23 kg ha(- 1) year(- 1)) currently applied in China can hardly affect the safety of maize grains in arable soil, even over a long period.
