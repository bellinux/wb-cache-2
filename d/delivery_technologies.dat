30|$|The H. 264 {{standard}} {{provides a}} network abstraction layer (NAL) for adapting {{the output of}} the video encoder to the requirements of the underlying <b>delivery</b> <b>technology</b> [4 – 6]. The underlying <b>delivery</b> <b>technology</b> discussed in this paper (i.e., an 802.11 e WLAN) uses a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) MAC layer with controlled and contention-based access methods. Utilizing user defined mechanisms, it is possible to achieve prioritized or guaranteed services in the 802.11 e MAC layer. Although such services can be simply used to serve the video traffic as a regular stream, higher performance, efficiency and video quality can be achieved if the MAC and NAL services and parameters are optimized using the available information from each layer.|$|R
