5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E
25|$|Her ailing brother {{formally}} <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> {{power in}} October 1383. She could not defeat Nwe's rebellion.

The new king reappointed his adoptive mother to her old post at Dagon but purely in a ceremonial role.|$|E

25|$|Joan {{was later}} {{captured}} by the Burgundians at the siege of Compiègne on 24 May 1430. The Burgundians <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to their English allies.

25|$|QE2 {{remains an}} oceangoing vessel, and as such, Ronald Warwick (former Captain of QE2, QM2 and a retired Commodore of the Cunard Line) was {{initially}} employed by V-Ships (who have managed QE2 since Cunard <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over) as the vessel's legal master, but has subsequently {{been replaced by}} other V-Ships captains. Since 2009, she has been captained by William Cooper.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life preserver, but the waters were too rough, and she was too {{exhausted}} to grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> a flotation device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E

The group made its final appearance together for a charity event on 2 May in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Andes {{sea trials}} were {{scheduled}} for 29–31 August 1939. She {{was scheduled to}} leave Southampton on her maiden voyage to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires on 26 September, which was the centenary of RMSP's foundation. But her sea trials were postponed, and when the UK and France declared war on Germany on 3 September the Senior Naval Officer at Belfast cancelled them. RML agreed to accept her without sea trials, and Harland and Wolff <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over at midnight on 24 September.|$|E
25|$|At any rate, she {{retained}} her brother's trust. He <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> {{more power}} {{over the years as}} his health continued to deteriorate. Jockeying for power became more fierce. More factions now allied themselves with the princess and Maru. The Maha Dewi–Maru faction was firmly in power by the early 1380s when the king's health rapidly declined. By 1382, she was the de facto ruler. The main opposition to her rule would come from her nephew and adopted son Binnya Nwe in 1383.|$|E

25|$|Upon her husband's {{death in}} 1862, Surratt had to manage his estate. Tired {{of doing so}} without help, Surratt moved to her townhouse in Washington, D.C., which she then ran as a boardinghouse. There, she was {{introduced}} to John Wilkes Booth. Booth visited the boardinghouse numerous times, as did George Atzerodt and Lewis Powell, Booth's co-conspirator in the Lincoln assassination. Shortly before leaving Washington to kill Lincoln, Booth spoke with Surratt and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> a package containing binoculars {{for one of her}} tenants, John M. Lloyd.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd SS Panzer Division, {{during their}} advance to Normandy, was {{responsible}} for the Tulle murders on 9 June 1944 and the massacre at the village of Oradour-sur-Glane on 10 June. The operations by the Bulbasket team, amongst others, delayed the arrival of the division in Normandy until the end of June. The 2nd SS Panzer Division {{was responsible for}} the capture of the Special Operations Executive agent Violette Szabo on 10 June 1944. They <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to the Sicherheitsdienst security police in Limoges.|$|E

25|$|The HMS Hermione was a frigate of the Royal Navy, {{commanded}} by Captain Hugh Pigot. In September 1797 {{a number of}} the crew had risen up against the tyrannical Pigot and had murdered him and nine other officers, throwing their bodies overboard. Fearing retribution for their actions, the mutineers had sailed the HMS Hermione to the Spanish port of La Guaira, and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to the Spanish. The mutineers claimed they had set the officers adrift in a small boat, as had happened in the mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 2005, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Anne Härmaste, Chargé d'Affaires {{ad interim}} of Estonia in Russia, and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> a note {{containing}} a {{notice of the}} intention of the Russian Federation to withdraw its signature and not to become a party to the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia on the Russian-Estonian State Border and to the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia on the Delimitation of the Sea Areas in the Narva Estuary and Gulf of Finland.|$|E
25|$|While in the Soviet Union, Svetlana {{had written}} a memoir in Russian in 1963. The {{manuscript}} was carried safely {{out of the country}} by Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Svetlana <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle {{at the time of her}} own defection. Rayle made a copy of it. The book was titled Twenty Letters to a Friend (Dvadtsat' pisem k drugu). It was the only thing other than a few items of clothing taken by Svetlana on a secret passenger flight out of India. Nevertheless, as noted by Raymond Pearson (Russia and Eastern Europe), her book turned out to be quite disappointing. It featured Svetlana's naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Beria, and whitewash her own father.|$|E

25|$|Salerno {{played a}} {{conspicuous}} {{part in the}} fall of the Norman Kingdom. After the Emperor Henry VI's invasion on behalf of his wife, Constance, the heiress to the kingdom, in 1191, Salerno surrendered and promised loyalty on the mere news of an incoming army. This so disgusted the archbishop, Nicolò d'Aiello, that he abandoned the city and fled to Naples, which held out in a siege. In 1194, the situation reversed itself: Naples capitulated, along with most other cities of the Mezzogiorno, and only Salerno resisted. It was sacked and pillaged, much reducing its importance and prosperity. Henry had his reasons, though. He had entrusted Constance to the citizens and after his retreat from invasion in 1191 they had received letters about the events from Nicolò and betrayed Henry, attacked Constance at Castel Terracena and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to King Tancredi of Sicily, making the Empress captive for nearly one year. Her combined treachery and stubbornness cost Salerno much after the Hohenstaufen conquest. Henry's son, Frederick II, moreover, issued a series of edicts that reduced Salerno's role in favour of Naples (in particular, the foundation of the University of Naples in that city).|$|E
25|$|The Hermione was {{a former}} frigate of the Royal Navy, {{commanded}} by Captain Hugh Pigot. In September 1797 {{a number of the}} crew had risen up against the apparently tyrannical Pigot and had murdered him and nine other officers, throwing their bodies overboard. Fearing retribution for their actions, the mutineers had sailed the Hermione to the Spanish port of La Guaira, and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> over to the authorities. When news of the mutiny reached Parker, he demanded the return of the ship and the surrender of the mutineers, instigating a process that would eventually see the apprehending of 33 of them. The Hermione meanwhile had been renamed Santa Cecilia, but remained in port. News eventually reached Parker that the Santa Cecilia had been sighted in Puerto Cabello, and ordered the Surprise to intercept her, should she attempt to put to sea. Hamilton decided that the honour of the Royal Navy depended on the recovery of the ship, and was determined to retake her. Anchoring near the port he devised a plan to cut her out of the harbour and asked for a boat and an extra 20 men from Parker. Parker declared the scheme too risky, and refused to send the men, but Hamilton went ahead anyway.|$|E
