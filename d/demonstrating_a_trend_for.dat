40|$|This paper {{presents}} evaluation data {{following the}} {{revision of the}} delivery method for an anatomy and physiology module for pre-registration healthcare practitioners, into a blended (hybrid) model. This subject is recognized as problematic when delivered by traditional methods, therefore change was instigated to introduce stimulating, interactive material; this was presented though use of e-learning tools to supplement the face-to-face sessions. The evaluation data consists of student outcomes from the hybrid mode of delivery compared with previous cohorts using the traditional methods, plus student satisfaction surveys from the students undertaking the module by blended learning. Results of the evaluation have identified that student outcomes for the new delivery method are <b>demonstrating</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> improvement for a multiplechoice exam, with no significant difference noted for a seen exam. The survey determined {{that the majority of}} students indicated satisfaction with the overall quality of the module, with the teaching methods, with the content and with the support provided to them. Therefore, this study suggests that a well designed blended learning system, with good academic content and interactive exercises are motivating for learning and yields as good, if not better, outcomes as a lecture. The module delivery will continue to be enhanced through the addition of synchronous chat facilities and online social network tools...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{current study}} compares the {{compliance}} rates of patients on depot {{who were on}} Community Treatment Orders with {{those who were not}} on such Order with a view to objectively quantify the effect of Community Treatment Orders on depot antipsychotics medication compliance. METHODS: "Day difference" measurements between the scheduled depot data and the administered date were collected for both voluntary and involuntary patients receiving depot medication at the same community clinic over a 6 -month period. RESULTS: The results <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> greater compliance to depot medications by those not on a Community Treatment Order compared with those who were, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlighted that while Community Treatment Order may be a reasonable short-term tool to encourage patients' compliance at an early treatment stage, ongoing effort should be put into improving patients' attitude towards depot medications to ensure a better long-term outcome for individuals with schizophrenia.

The secondary objective was the comparison for outcomes versus S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e). Subjects with mild depression or anxiety were given the Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Schwartz Outcome Scale (SOS- 10). Forty-two subjects (21 – 65 years old) were randomized to eight-weeks of supplementation with UP 165 or SAM-e with questionnaires being administered at randomization, week four and eight. Those receiving UP 165 achieved significant reduction from baseline at weeks four and eight, respectively for the BDI-II, as well as <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> reduction in BAI at week four and significance at week eight.

40|$|Ninety-five of 105 {{patients}} who underwent jejunoileal bypass had preoperative {{and at least}} one set of postoperative liver tests and liver biopsy within 18 months of surgery. There were numerous and, at times, impressive histologic or biochemical abnormalities in obese {{patients who}} were not operated. No correlation was found between postoperative liver injury and the preoperative concentration of serum albumin or SGOT, or with the certain histologic lesions (steatosis, lobular necrosis or inflammation). However, the preoperative pericellular fibrosis persisted or progressed in eight of 11 of the patients. The rate of postoperative weight loss did not seem to influence liver morphology but the initial velocity of weight loss could not be determined in this study. Liver biopsy specimens <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> greater postoperative decreases of serum albumin concentrations (p less than 0. 05) in those patients who developed more severe lesions.

40|$|Cancer/testis (CT) {{genes are}} {{predominantly}} expressed in human germ line cells, but not somatic tissues, and frequently become activated in different cancer types. Several CT antigens have already {{proved to be}} useful biomarkers and are promising targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the expression of CT antigens in breast cancer. Using previously generated massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data, together with 9 publicly available gene expression datasets, the expression pattern of CT antigens located on the X chromosome (CT-X) was interrogated. Whereas a minority of unselected breast cancers was found to contain CT-X transcripts, a significantly higher expression frequency was detected in estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cell lines and primary breast carcinomas. A coordinated pattern of CT-X antigen expression was observed, with MAGEA and NY-ESO- 1 /CTAG 1 B being the most prevalent antigens. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the correlation of CT-X antigen expression and ER negativity in breast tumors and <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> their coexpression with basal cell markers.

40|$|Paclitaxel {{was loaded}} into {{licensed}} parenteral nutrition nanoemulsions (ClinoleicÂ® and IntralipidÂ®) using bath sonication, and {{the stability of}} the formulations was investigated following storage for two weeks at room temperature or at 4 Â°C. In general, Clinoleic droplets were smaller than Intralipid droplets, being around 255 and 285 nm, respectively, for blank and freshly loaded emulsions. Regardless of storage temperature, the Clinoleic exhibited a very slight or no increase in droplet size upon storage, whilst the droplet size of the Intralipid emulsion increased significantly. The droplet size of both emulsions was minimally affected by paclitaxel concentration within the range of 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg/ml. The pH of both emulsions markedly decreased upon storage at room temperature, which was possibly attributed to the production of fatty acids resulting from phospholipid hydrolysis. However, at 4 Â°C, the pH of Clinoleic emulsion was unaffected by storage or paclitaxel concentration while the Intralipid emulsion <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> pH reduction. Both nanoemulsions had a negative zeta potential, with the Clinoleic formulations having the highest charge, possibly explaining the better size stability of this emulsion.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} to assess the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in small animal coronary vessels after balloon injury, to provide data {{for the design of}} future pre-clinical experiments and human clinical trials. The search strategy included the PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CKNI) databases. The endpoint was the ratio of vascular neointima/media (I/M). Moreover, neointimal area, re-endothelialization, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression were analyzed. Pooled analyses were conducted using random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also explored. All data were analyzed using RevMan 5. 2 and Stata 12. 0. Fifteen studies were reviewed from 238 retrieved animal studies. Compared with controls, MSC transplantation resulted in greater I/M reduction (pooled difference, 0. 39; 95 % CI, 0. 57 - 0. 21; P 106; P = 0. 017) and later time point of I/M measurement (P = 0. 022) were significantly associated with I/M reduction. Subgroup analysis <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater reduction in the ratio of I/M with late MSC transplantation (> 1 day), MSCs transplanted through intravenous injection, and atherosclerotic vessels.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesChronic {{cerebrospinal}} {{venous insufficiency}} (CCSVI) {{is associated with}} multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective {{of the study was}} to see if percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of duplex-detected lesions, of the internal jugular and/or azygous veins, was safe, burdened by a significant restenosis rate, and whether there was any evidence that treatment reduced MS disease activity. Design: This was a case-control study. Materials: We studied 15 patients with relapsing–remitting MS and duplex-detected CCSVI. MethodsEight patients had PTA in addition to medical therapy (immediate treatment group (ITG)), whereas seven had treatment with PTA after 6 months of medical therapy alone (delayed treatment group (DTG)). ResultsNo adverse events occurred. At 1 year, there was a restenosis rate of 27 %. Overall, PTA was followed by a significant improvement in functional score compared with baseline (p <  0. 02). The annualised relapse rate was 0. 12 % in the ITG compared with 0. 66 % in the DTG (p = NS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blindly <b>demonstrates</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> fewer T 2 lesions in the ITG (p =  0. 081), corresponding to a 10 % decrease in the ITG compared with a 23 % increase in the DTG over the first 6 months of the study. ConclusionsThis study further confirms the safety of PTA treatment in patients with CCSVI associated with MS. The results, despite the significant rate of restenosis, are encouraging and warrant a larger multicentre double-blinded, randomised study...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Working memory {{impairments}} in schizophrenia {{have been attributed}} to dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which in turn may be due to low DLPFC dopamine innervation. Conventional antipsychotic drugs block DLPFC D 2 receptors, and this may lead to further dysfunction and working memory impairments. Aripiprazole is a D 2 receptor partial agonist hypothesised to enhance PFC dopamine functioning, possibly improving working memory. Objectives: We probed the implications of the partial D 2 receptor agonist actions of aripiprazole within the DLPFC during working memory. Investigations were carried out in healthy volunteers to eliminate confounds of illness or medication status. Aripiprazole’s prefrontal actions were compared with the D 2 / 5 -HT 2 A blocker risperidone to separate aripiprazole’s unique prefrontal D 2 agonist actions from its serotinergic and striatal D 2 actions that it shares with risperidone. Method: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design was implemented. Participants received a single dose of either 5 mg aripiprazole, 1 mg risperidone or placebo before performing the n-back task whilst undergoing fMRI scanning. Results: Compared with placebo, the aripiprazole group demonstrated enhanced DLPFC activation associated with <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> improved discriminability (d’) and speeded reaction times. In contrast to aripiprazole’s neural effects, the risperidone group <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> reduced DLPFC recruitment. Unexpectedly, the risperidone group demonstrated similar effects to aripiprazole on d’ and additionally had reduced errors of commission compared with placebo. Conclusion: Aripiprazole has unique DLPFC actions attributed to its prefrontal D 2 agonist action. Risperidone’s serotinergic action that results in prefrontal dopamine release may have protected against any impairing effects of its prefrontal D 2 blockade...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{classified}} {{patients with}} psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) {{according to a}} newly proposed classification system. Then, we investigated the demographic and clinical differences between various classes of the patients. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated all patients with PNESs admitted to the Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center from 2012 through 2016. We classified the patients into four distinct classes: patients with generalized motor seizures, patients with akinetic seizures, patients with focal motor seizures, and patients with seizures with subjective symptoms. All patients were interviewed by a neuropsychologist and were administered psychological assessment measures, including questions about PNES risk factors. For the statistical analyses, we compared patients who had generalized motor seizures with patients who had nonmotor seizures. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were studied. Thirty-five (55. 6 %) patients had generalized motor seizures, 14 (22. 2 %) had seizures with subjective symptoms, 12 (19 %) had akinetic seizures, and two (3. 2 %) patients had focal motor seizures. Patients with generalized motor seizures (35 patients) <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> later age at onset (p= 0. 06), more frequently {{had a history of}} substance abuse (p= 0. 001), and more often had loss of responsiveness with their seizures (p= 0. 04) compared with patients who had nonmotor seizures (26 patients). CONCLUSION: The recently proposed PNES classification system is useful and practical. This proposed classification of PNESs may address proper diagnosis and provide standardization across future studies. This may also potentially shed light on the etiologic understanding and management of various classes of patients affected with PNESs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{examined}} the effect of physiologic pacing {{on the development of}} chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) in the Canadian Trial Of Physiologic Pacing (CTOPP). BACKGROUNDThe role of physiologic pacing to prevent CAF remains unclear. Small randomized studies have suggested a benefit for patients with sick sinus syndrome. No data from a large randomized trial are available. METHODSThe CTOPP randomized patients undergoing first pacemaker implant to ventricular-based or physiologic pacing (AAI or DDD). Patients who were prospectively found to have persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) lasting {{greater than or equal to}} one week were defined as having CAF. Kaplan-Meier plots for the development of CAF were compared by log-rank test. The effect of baseline variables on the benefit of physiologic pacing was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTSPhysiologic pacing reduced the development of CAF by 27. 1 %, from 3. 84 % per year to 2. 8 % per year (p = 0. 016). Three clinical factors predicted the development of CAF: age ≥ 74 years (p = 0. 057), sinoatrial (SA) node disease (p < 0. 001) and prior AF (p < 0. 001). Subgroup analysis <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> patients with no history of myocardial infarction or coronary disease (p = 0. 09) as well as apparently normal left ventricular function (p = 0. 11) to derive greatest benefit. CONCLUSIONSPhysiologic pacing reduces the annual rate of development of chronic AF in patients undergoing first pacemaker implant. Age ≥ 74 years, SA node disease and prior AF predicted the development of CAF. Patients with structurally normal hearts appear to derive greatest benefits...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is a high}} {{incidence}} cancer affecting many Canadian adults each year. Diet {{is important in the}} etiology of CRC with many dietary components identified as potential risk factors. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a well-established pattern to characterize overall eating. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize a DASH pattern within the Canadian context and to assess its relationship to the risk of CRC in Canadian adults. Methods: Unconditional multiple logistic regression with control for confounding variables was performed using data from the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance Study. Dietary intake was captured for this case-control study through a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and categorized into a DASH score ranging from 0 to 10 representing a poor to a strong DASH pattern respectively. Results: Consuming a strong DASH pattern of eating (score ≥ 8) was not common in the 3161 cases and 3097 controls. Overall, only 10. 8 % of men and 13. 6 % of women had a strong DASH pattern. Multivariate analysis <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> decreasing risk of CRC in men with increasing DASH scores (p value <b>for</b> <b>trend</b> =. 007). Men with a strong DASH score had a 33 % reduction in risk of CRC compared to those with a low DASH score. There were no significant <b>trends</b> <b>for</b> women for CRC or for colon or rectal cancers separately. Conclusion: Our findings are similar to other researchers suggesting a benefit with a strong DASH pattern associated with a decreased risk of CRC, especially in men. Research should further investigate our gender-based differences...|$|R
40|$|To {{weigh the}} pros and cons of familial-mismatched/haploidentical {{transplantation}} (FMT) in patients with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia, we assessed outcomes of 23 patients who underwent FMT, using reduced-intensity conditioning with total body irradiation 800 cGy/busulfan/fludarabine/antithymocyte globulin without ex vivo T cell depletion, compared to 33 patients who underwent well-matched unrelated donor transplantation (WM-UDT) and 13 who underwent partially matched unrelated donor transplantation (PM-UDT) during the same period. The FMT patients had not only a similar pattern of engraftment and immune reconstitution as the WM-UDT and PM-UDT patients but also comparable incidences and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The FMT patients did not experience any form of engraftment failure. However, the cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus DNAemia was significantly higher in the FMT group compared with the other groups (P = . 036). After a median follow-up of 28 months, overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were 83 %, 74 %, 20 %, and 7 %, respectively, for WM-UDT; 51 %, 51 %, 31 %, and 18 % for PM-UDT; and 66 %, 64 %, 26 %, and 10 % <b>for</b> FMT. This <b>demonstrates</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> favorable survival outcomes of WM-UDT over FMT and of FMT over PM-UDT. However, we found no significant statistical differences in survival according to donor type. These data need to be interpreted cautiously because of limited power calculations due to the small number of each donor group. This pilot study suggests the feasibility of FMT using our novel regimen with careful evaluation of CMV DNAemia compared with WM-UDT and PM-UDT. Further trials with larger numbers of patients, comparing FMT directly with transplantation with other donor types, are needed...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} known to be {{composed}} of distinct popula-tions of cancer cells, some of which demonstrate increased capac-ity for cancer initiation and/or metastasis. The study of human cancer cell populations is difficult due to long requirements for tumor growth, interpatient variability, and the need for tumor growth in immune-deficient mice. We therefore characterized the cancer initiation capacity of distinct cancer cell populations in a transgenic murine model of ovarian cancer. In this model, con-ditional deletion of Apc, Pten, and Trp 53 in the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) results in the generation of high-grade meta-static ovarian carcinomas. Cell lines derived from these murine tumors express numerous putative stem cell markers, including CD 24, CD 44, CD 90, CD 117, CD 133, and ALDH. We show that CD 24 þ and CD 133 þ cells have increased tumor sphere-forming capacity. CD 133 þ cells <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> increased tumor initiation while CD 24 þ cells versus CD 24 cells had significantly greater tumor initiation and tumor growth capacity. No prefer-ential tumor-initiating or growth capacity was observed for CD 44 þ, CD 90 þ, CD 117 þ, or ALDHþ versus their negative coun-terparts. We have found that CD 24 þ cells, compared with CD 24 cells, have increased phosphorylation of STAT 3 and increased expression of STAT 3 target Nanog and c-myc. JAK 2 inhibition of STAT 3 phosphorylation preferentially induced cytotoxicity in CD 24 þ cells. In vivo JAK 2 inhibitor therapy dramatically reduced tumor metastases, and prolonged overall survival. These findings indicate that CD 24 þ cells play a role in tumor migration and metastasis and support JAK 2 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.

40|$|Background: Plantar {{forefoot}} ulcers {{in individuals}} with diabetes {{often lead to}} deep infection and lower extremity amputation. increasing {{evidence suggests that the}} process is initiated by increased passive stiffness within the gastrocnemius-soleus musculotendinous unit. the goal of this investigation was to perform ultrasound examination of the Achilles tendon in a consecutive group of asymptomatic diabetic individuals to identify any inherent structural pathology that might be associated with the increased stiffness that appears {{to be associated with the}} development of diabetic forefoot ulcers. Materials and Methods: Seventy consecutive diabetic individuals with no past history of diabetic foot morbidity underwent ultrasonography of their Achilles tendons. Each patient was also tested for fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin as a measure of diabetes control. Ten similarly aged non-diabetics with no history of Achilles tendinopathy served as controls. Results: the ultrasonography revealed disorganized tendon fibers in 62 of 70 (89 %) patients, and calcification within the Achilles tendon in 53 (76 %) patients. the Achilles tendon thickness averaged 5. 0 (range, 4 to 8) mm. There was no correlation between patient age and Achilles tendon thickness (r = 0. 292, p = 0. 014); however, there was <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> duration of disease and Achilles tendon disorganization (p = 0. 073). the oldest patients also appeared to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> more ultrasound-measured Achilles tendinopathy. There was no correlation between fasting glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin and Achilles tendon alterations. Conclusion: This investigation confirms structural abnormalities within the Achilles tendon of diabetic individuals that might represent biologic changes affecting the inherent stiffness that leads to increased forefoot pressure and the development of plantar forefoot ulcers. This process appears to worsen with advanced age and does not appear to be related to diabetes control.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) represents a continuum of cognitive and functional deficits. Methods: Clinical data of 164 subjects with no dementia (ND, n = 52), uncertain dementia (n = 69), and mild probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD, n = 43) were reviewed. Uncertain dementia patients were classified as pre-MCI (n = 11), early amnestic MCI (e-aMCI, n = 15) and late amnestic MCI (l-aMCI, n = 15). Cognitive assessments [Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and a validated neuropsychological battery], functional assessments (Lawton’s scale for instrumental activities of daily living) and neuroimaging (ischemic lesions and medial temporal lobe atrophy) were reviewed.

40|$|Accurate, {{predictive}} {{assessment of}} the behaviour and progression of oral cancers and precancers remains elusive in clinical practice. Archival tissue specimens from 10 previously treated patients with oral lesions of known clinical outcome (3 years post-treatment) were re-examined histopathologically, and proliferative cell labelling indices (LIs) determined for Ki 67, cyclin A and histone mRNA cell cycle markers. While histone mRNA labelling ultimately proved unreliable, both Ki 67 and cyclin <b>A</b> LIs <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> enhanced labelling to occur in increasingly dysplastic and neoplastic tissue, with particular emphasis on suprabasal labelling in abnormal tissue. Perhaps of greatest significance was the observation of increased LIs and suprabasal labelling in lesions with poor clinical outcome, such as patients developing recurrent disease or cervical lymph node metastasis. Measurement of cell proliferative activity in individual oral epithelial dysplastic lesions or invasive squamous cell carcinomas may thus provide unique, predictive information on clinical outcome.

40|$|Abstract Background Whole genome {{duplication}} (WGD) is {{a special}} case of gene duplication, observed rarely in animals, whereby all genes duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation. Two rounds of WGD (2 R-WGD) occurred {{at the base of}} vertebrates, giving rise to an enormous wave of genetic novelty, but a systematic analysis of functional consequences of this event has not yet been performed. Results We show that 2 R-WGD affected an overwhelming majority (74 %) of signalling genes, in particular developmental pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt and transforming growth factor-β ligands, G protein-coupled receptors and the apoptosis pathway. 2 R-retained genes, in contrast to tandem duplicates, were enriched in protein interaction domains and multifunctional signalling modules of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. 2 R-WGD had a fundamental impact on the cell-cycle machinery, redefined molecular building blocks of the neuronal synapse, and was formative for vertebrate brains. We investigated 2 R-associated nodes {{in the context of the}} human signalling network, as well as in an inferred ancestral pre- 2 R (AP 2 R) network, and found that hubs (particularly involving negative regulation) were preferentially retained, with high connectivity driving retention. Finally, microarrays and proteomics <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> gradual paralog expression divergence independent of the duplication mechanism, but inferred ancestral expression states suggested preferential subfunctionalisation among 2 R-ohnologs (2 ROs). Conclusions The 2 R event left an indelible imprint on vertebrate signalling and the cell cycle. We show that 2 R-WGD preferentially retained genes are associated with higher organismal complexity (for example, locomotion, nervous system, morphogenesis), while genes associated with basic cellular functions (for example, translation, replication, splicing, recombination; with the notable exception of cell cycle) tended to be excluded. 2 R-WGD set the stage for the emergence of key vertebrate functional novelties (such as complex brains, circulatory system, heart, bone, cartilage, musculature and adipose tissue). A full explanation of the impact of 2 R on evolution, function and the flow of information in vertebrate signalling networks is likely to have practical consequences for regenerative medicine, stem cell therapies and cancer treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} precocity-longevity (P-L) effect in North American {{professional}} basketball players who debuted between 1946 and 1979, {{and to determine}} whether playing position and decade of play influenced the relationship between age of career achievements and lifespan. Methods: 1852 players were evaluated from a recognized sports archive (i. e., sports-reference. com), which provided information on date of birth, death, and career debut, playing position, and indicators of achievement (i. e., All-Star team and/or All-League team selection). Athletes were categorized as above or below {{the median age of}} professional debut, and median age of selection to first All-Star team and/or All-League team. Analyses of deceased players (n = 598) were comprised of bivariate correlations between age of achievement (age of debut, age of first All-Star game and age of first All-League team selection) and age of death, and t-tests to compared the average age of death of early and late achievers (p <. 05). Survival analyses, using the entire sample (living and deceased players), compared the lifespans between those who debuted above and below the median age of achievement for each indicator of achievement. Results: Only the correlation between age of professional debut and age of death (r =. 33, p <. 001) and age of first all-star game and age of death (r =. 29, p <. 05) and the t-test comparing the average death age of early (66. 4 y) and later (69. 3 y) debut age groups (p =. 01), reached statistical significance. However, survival analyses <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> lower risk of death for early achievers, with one exception (i. e., age of debut) this trend was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Results did not support the P-L hypothesis, suggesting that sample characteristics (i. e., physical fitness of high performance athletes), and measurement methodologies, may influence support for the proposed hypothesis in sport. However, future research would benefit form larger sample sizes and cause of death data...|$|R
40|$|The survey {{questionnaire}} {{of the present}} research, <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> consuming large quantities of alcohol at one sitting. Extending from this, the present thesis investigated the 'naturally' occurring hangover, alone and in combination with an additional stressor, white noise. Aiming to be high on ecological validity participants were allowed to consume their usual quantity and type of beverage in place and company of choice. To facilitate {{a comparison of the}} naturally occurring hangover with effects observed to peak BAC on mood, memory, psychomotor performance and attention the present research also employed the methodology of previous studies by administering a standardised dose of alcohol prior to completing the task battery. It was observed that participants were less alert, less tranquil and more anxious the morning after alcohol consumption. In contrast the acute intoxication state was characterised by reduced alertness. It was revealed that the hangover state and acute intoxication state had differential effects on memory and psychomotor performance. Both the acute and post intoxication state reduce the ability to focus attention to an identified location and greater interference was observed in the hangover state. The response latency in the vigilance task revealed no effects of either acute intoxication or post intoxication, however when in the hangover state an increase of omission errors was observed. The effect of an additional stressor, on the measured aspects of mood was to decrease alertness in early morning. Noise interacted with the post intoxication state resulting in poorer memory and psychomotor performance. The results suggest that participants lower their performance targets to protect the system from any costs of subjectivity felt increased effort. The present research indicates that the consumption of large amounts of alcohol at one sitting reduces memory performance the following morning, causing a slowing of psychomotor response and has selective effects on attention. It is of concern that this compromised hangover state is not detectable in breath analyses and it is possible that individuals, are not performing at their peak level due to the consumption of alcohol the night before...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} if parasympathetic nervous system (PsNS) activity is a significant biomarker of sensory processing difficulties in children. Several studies have demonstrated that PsNS activity is an important regulator of reactivity in children, and thus, it is of interest to study whether PsNS activity is related to sensory reactivity in children who have a type of condition associated with sensory processing disorders termed sensory modulation dysfunction (SMD). If so, this will have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying sensory processing problems of children and for developing intervention strategies to address them. The primary aims of this project were: (1) to evaluate PsNS activity in children with SMD compared to typically developing (TYP) children, and (2) to determine if PsNS activity is a significant predictor of sensory behaviors and adaptive functions among children with SMD. We examine PsNS activity during the Sensory Challenge Protocol; which includes baseline, the administration of eight sequential stimuli in five sensory domains, recovery, and also evaluate response to a prolonged auditory stimulus. As a secondary aim we examined whether subgroups of children with specific physiological and behavioral sensory reactivity profiles can be identified. Results indicate that as a total group the children with severe SMD <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> low baseline PsNS activity, compared to TYP children, suggesting this may be a biomarker for SMD. In addition, children with SMD as <b>a</b> total group <b>demonstrated</b> significantly poorer adaptive behavior in the communication and daily living subdomains and in the overall Adaptive Behavior Composite of the Vineland than TYP children. Using latent class analysis, the subjects were grouped by severity and the severe SMD group had significantly lower PsNS activity at baseline, tones and prolonged auditory. These results provide preliminary evidence that children who demonstrate severe SMD may have physiological activity that is different from children without SMD, and that these physiological and behavioral manifestations of SMD may affect a child's ability to engage in everyday social, communication, and daily living skills.

40|$|The brain {{represents}} a frequent progression site in lung adenocarcinoma. This {{study was designed}} to analyse the association between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and the frequency of brain metastases (BM) and survival in routine clinical practice. Patients and methods. We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 629 patients with adenocarcinoma in Slovenia who were tested for EGFR mutations in order to analyse the cumulative incidence of BM, the time from the diagnosis to the development of BM (TDBM), the time from BM to death (TTD) and the median survival. Results. Out of 629 patients, 168 (27 %) had BM, 90 patients already at the time of diagnosis. Additional 78 patients developed BM after a median interval of 14. 3 months 25. 8 months in EGFR positive and 11. 8 months in EGFR negative patients, respectively (p = 0. 002). EGFR mutations were present in 47 (28 %) patients with BM. The curves for cumulative incidence of BM in EGFR positive and negative patients <b>demonstrate</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> higher incidence of BM in EGFR mutant patients at diagnosis (19 % vs. 13 %, p = 0. 078), but no difference later {{during the course of the}} disease. The patients with BM at diagnosis had a statistically longer TTD (7. 3 months) than patients who developed BM later (3. 1 months). The TTD in EGFR positive patients with BM at diagnosis was longer than in EGFR negative patients (12. 6 vs. 6. 8, p = 0. 005), while there was no impact of EGFR status on the TTD of patients who developed BM later. Conclusions. Except for a non-significant increase of frequency of BM at diagnosis in EGFR positive patients, EGFR status had no influence upon the cumulative incidence of BM. EGFR positive patients had a longer time to CNS progression. While EGFR positive patients with BM at diagnosis had a longer survival, EGFR status had no influence on TTD in patients who developed BM later during the course of disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper was to {{investigate}} the relationships between field independence-dependence (FI-FD), self-concept and playfulness in preadolescent girls and boys. Sixty-three sixth-grade students (33 girls, 30 boys) from four classes in three schools in Southwestern Ontario participated in the study, with each student completing the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT; Witkin, Oltman 2 ̆ 6 Raskin, 1971) and The Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI; Coopersmith, 1967). The students 2 ̆ 7 current teachers (2 female, 2 male) and those from the previous year (2 female, 3 male) completed the Playfulness-NonPlayfulness Scale (PF-NonPF; Lieberman, 1977 a). Contrary to prediction, no significant gender differences or correlations were found between the total scores of the three main variables. The hypothesis that field independence is negatively associated with self-concept and playfulness among girls was supported by significant negative correlations found between field independence and self-concept, and field independence and playfulness. In contrast, the hypothesis that field independence would be positively associated with self-concept and playfulness among boys was only partially supported by significant positive correlations found between field independence and self-concept whereas field independence and playfulness were not found to be related. The hypotheses were further supported by subsequent analyses which <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> FI girls and FD boys to report lower feelings of self-worth and to be rated as less playful by their teachers as compared to FD girls and FI boys respectively. The pedagological implications of the results were reviewed followed by the main conclusion that gender differences in preadolescence regarding cognitive style, self-concept and playfulness are largely due to socializing pressures from parents, teachers, peers and the media to conform to socio-cultural gender-role stereotypes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to determine whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) -mediated signalling and some key regulatory proteins of translation initiation are altered in skeletal muscle during the immediate phase of recovery following acute resistance exercise. Rats were operantly conditioned to reach an illuminated bar located high on a Plexiglass cage, such that the animals completed concentric and eccentric contractions involving the hindlimb musculature. Gastrocnemius muscle was extracted immediately after acute exercise and 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min of recovery. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) on Ser- 473 peaked at 10 min of recovery (282 % of control, P < 0. 05) with no significant changes noted for mTOR phosphorylation on Ser- 2448. Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4 E-binding protein- 1 (4 E-BP 1) and S 6 kinase- 1 (S 6 K 1), both downstream effectors of mTOR, were altered during recovery as well. 4 E-BP 1 phosphorylation was significantly elevated at 10 min (292 %, P < 0. 01) of recovery. S 6 K 1 phosphorylation on Thr- 389 <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> peak activation at 10 min following exercise (336 %, P = 0. 06) with ribosomal protein S 6 phosphorylation being maximally activated at 15 min of recovery (647 %, P < 0. 05). Components of the eIF 4 F complex were enhanced during recovery as eIF 4 E association with eIF 4 G peaked at 10 min (292 %, P < 0. 05). Events regulating the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit were assessed through eIF 2 B activity and eIF 2 α phosphorylation on Ser- 51. No differences were noted with either eIF 2 B or eIF 2 α. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that mTOR-mediating signalling is transiently upregulated during the immediate period following resistance exercise and this response may constitute the most proximal growth response of the cell...|$|R

Statistics regarding the time frame of collapses in the bridge lifetime, bridge structural configuration and the number of resulting casualties are presented. The results show that collapses due to natural hazards, design errors and limited knowledge are the most commonly encountered in metallic bridges, followed by accidents and human error. When analysed chronologically, the data <b>demonstrates</b> <b>a</b> decreasing <b>trend</b> <b>for</b> collapses attributed to limited knowledge and <b>an</b> increasing <b>trend</b> in failures resulting from accidents and natural hazards.
