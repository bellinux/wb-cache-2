40|$|Abstract. The {{hybrid of}} liquid {{crystalline}} polymer (LCP) <b>fibres</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> (GF) provide {{a combination of}} modulus and toughness to semi-crystalline linear-low-density-polyethylene (LLDPE). LCP and GF fibres reinforced composites were studied using two-body abrasion tesr under different applied loads. Two sets of fibre reinforced LLDPE, 10 and 20 vol%, were investigated. The contents of LCP and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were varied as 25, 50, 75 and 100 vol % of overall volume of fibres in LLDPE. The effect of replacing <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> with LCP fibre on wear is reported. Wear loss increased with the applied loads and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents in LLDPE. The replacements of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> with LCP fibres improved abrasive wear resistance of composite. The composite containing 20 vol % of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in LLDPE showed the specific wear rate nearly double to that of LCP fibre reinforced LLDPE. Incorporation of LCP fibre improved wear resistance of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforc d LLDPE.

Development of economically viable processes for recycling end-of-life <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composites would have major beneficial economic and environmental impacts for the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composites industry. This paper reports a study on regenerating the performance of thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The effectiveness of the ReCoVeR treatments on the single <b>fibre</b> strength of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> thermally treated to imitate the conditions of composite recycling technology is presented. The regenerated strength levels of these ReCoVeRed fibres must be further protected and maintained by the use of fibre sizing technology similar to standard <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> products. Consequently the effect on fibre strength of the combination of the ReCoVeR treatment with a standard silane coating was also studied. Significant increase of fibre strength was obtained through the regeneration treatments, achieving greater than triple the fibre strength in comparison with the thermally treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> Furthermore the same treatments have also been applied to <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> recovered from model composites using laboratory thermal recycling. Fibre strengths have been achieved which makes reusing these fibres as a composite reinforcement a viable option.

40|$|The {{recovery}} and reuse of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> from manufacturing waste and end-of-life composites in an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the thermosetting polymer composites industry. A number of processes for recycling fibres from such materials are available or under development.

40|$|Carbon <b>fibres</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> are {{reinforcements}} {{for advanced}} composites and the fiber strength {{is the most}} influential factor {{on the strength of}} the composites. They are essentially brittle and fail with very little reduction in cross section. Composites made with these fibres are characterized by a high strength/density ratio and their properties are intrisically related to their microstructure, i. e., amount and orientation of the fibres, surface treatment, among other factors. Processing parameters have {{an important role in the}} fibre mechanical behaviour (strength and modulus). Cracks, voids and impurities in the case of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and fibrillar misalignments in the case of carbon fibres are created during processing. Such inhomogeneities give rise to an appreciable scatter in properties. The most used statistical tool that deals with this characteristic variability in properties is the Weibull distribution. The present work investigates the influence of the testing gage length on the strength, Young's modulus and Weibull modulus of carbon <b>fibres</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The Young's modulus is calculated by two methods: (i) ASTM D 3379 M, and (ii) interaction between testing equipment/specimen The first method resulted in a Young modulus of 183 GPa for carbon fibre, and 76 GPa for <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> The second method gave a Young modulus of 250 GPa for carbon fibre and 50 GPa for <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> These differences revelead differences on how the interaction specimen/testing machine can interfere in the Young modulus calculations. Weibull modulus can be a tool to evaluate the fibre's homogeneity in terms of properties and it is a good quality control parameter during processing. In the range of specimen gage length tested the Weibull modulus for carbon fibre is ~ 3. 30 and for <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> is ~ 5. 65, which indicates that for the batch of <b>fibres</b> tested, the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> is more uniform in properties...|$|R
