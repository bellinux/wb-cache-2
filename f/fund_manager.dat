5|$|Because of Peter's {{imprisonment}} Alicia, {{a lawyer}} herself, is {{working as a}} junior associate at a law firm. Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. Their client, Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular mutual <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client is guilty. Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by spousal privilege laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free. The firm's investigator Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) visits FBI agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint) inquiring about the investigation into Peter. Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} career concerns on risky arbitrage. It presents an analytically tractable model where some <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> can locate arbitrage opportunities, i. e., fundamentally very similar assets with a temporary difference in their price. <b>Fund</b> <b>managers</b> need operating capital from investors to exploit these opportunities. Investors judge the abilities of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and decide whether to keep or fire them based on their past performance. Career concerns of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> distort their strategies which effect prices. In equilibrium, investors keep those arbitrageurs with higher probability who speculate on fast convergence of prices, even if the expected profit of this strategy is lower. As an effect, <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> over invest in these strategies which increase the probability of liquidity crises: episodes with large price divergences and large aggregate losses of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> without {{any change in the}} fundamentals...|$|R
5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. <b>fund</b> <b>manager</b> Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E

40|$|I conduct {{two studies}} that {{investigate}} the behavioral characteristics of mutual <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> First study, The Performance of Mutual Funds on Private Information, {{looks at the}} dimension of investment skills of <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> The investment skills of mutual <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> can be assessed by their ability to generate private information. In this study, by investigating the simultaneous actions of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and corporate managers, we estimate how much the actions of <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> {{can be attributed to}} private information. Using the information of insiders' transactions as a proxy for the managers' private information, our performance measure, PS (Private Shares), captures variations in skills among <b>fund</b> <b>managers,</b> suggesting that the funds with higher PS outperform the funds with lower PS. The finding that PS is positively related to future fund performance is consistent with our conjecture that <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> who actively trade on private information have better managerial skills than the ones that do not trade on private information. In the second study, Impact of Religious Belief on Asset Management Industry, we investigate the effects of religion on the investing behavior of <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> We propose a measure of corporate social responsibility propensity (CSRP) by <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> that captures the level of a manager's tendency to invest in firms that engage in socially responsible activities. Grounded in the basis of ethics and morality, religious belief is shown to {{have a positive impact on}} a <b>fund</b> <b>manager's</b> investment in firms with good corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. The positive association between religiosity and CSRP is particularly strong in the sample of non-institutional funds. On the performance aspect, we find that funds in the highly religious region with a higher propensity to invest in socially responsible firms tend to exhibit future performance deterioration. Our results suggest that local religiosity has a significant impact on the investing behavior of <b>fund</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} necessitated {{by the fact}} that, thus far, no prior {{research}} {{on the influence of}} behavioural aspects on the decision-making framework of listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> had been undertaken in the South African context. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether behavioural aspects influence listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa when they make decisions on property investments. To meet this objective, the study investigated the following aspects: â€¢	the influence of behavioural aspects on property holding periods; â€¢	the influence of various heuristic-driven biases and frame dependence (as behavioural aspects) respectively on the investment decisions of listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa; and â€¢	the importance of the use of market sentiment and personal experience rather than market fundamentals in listed property fund managersâ€™ decision-making in South Africa. Questionnaires were sent to 29 listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa. The 17 responses represented 80 % of the total market capitalisation of listed property funds in South Africa. The data were analysed using non-parametric statistical measures. The study led to the following important findings: â€¢	property holding periods are not influenced by behavioural aspects; â€¢	heuristic-driven biases do not influence the property investment decisions of listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa; â€¢	frame dependence, through the disposition effect and loss aversion, was a behavioural aspect that affected listed property fund managersâ€™ decision-making; â€¢	listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa indicated a strong orientation towards the use of a normative approach in property investment decision-making - market fundamentals and capital budgeting techniques as decision-making criteria were very important to them in their investment decisions; â€¢	market sentiment and personal experience were used to some extent by listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa; and â€¢	the listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa experience the influence of the national government on the property investment decisions that they as <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> make as negative, possibly making them, as <b>fund</b> <b>managers,</b> susceptible to behavioural biases. This studyâ€™s conclusions indicate that listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa are influenced by behavioural aspects in the form of frame dependence. Difficulties in buying new properties suggest that listed property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa are, to some extent, loss-averse. This study has pioneered research to establish whether behavioural aspects influence the decision-making of property <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> in an emerging economy such as that of South Africa.
