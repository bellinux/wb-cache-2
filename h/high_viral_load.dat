40|$|Children {{with human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection often have <b>higher</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> and progress to AIDS more rapidly than adults. Since the intestinal tract is a major site of early viral replication and CD 4 + T-cell depletion in adults, we {{examined the effects of}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) on both peripheral and intestinal lymphocytes from 13 neonatal macaques infected with SIVmac 239. Normal neonates had more CD 4 + T cells and fewer CD 8 + T cells in all tissues than adults. Surprisingly, neonates had substantial percentages of CD 4 + T cells with an activated, memory phenotype (effector CD 4 + T cells) in the lamina propria of the intestine compared to peripheral lymphoid tissues, even when examined on the day of birth. Moreover, profound and selective depletion of jejunum lamina propria CD 4 + T cells occurred in neonatal macaques within 21 days of infection, which was preceded by large numbers of SIV-infected cells in this compartment. Furthermore, neonates with less CD 4 + T-cell depletion in tissues tended to have <b>higher</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads.</b> The persistence of intestinal lamina propria CD 4 + T cells in some neonates with <b>high</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> suggests that increased turnover and/or resistance to CD 4 + T-cell loss may contribute to the <b>higher</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> and increased severity of disease in neonatal hosts...|$|R

50|$|Central to Marx et al. {{argument}} {{is the concept}} of adaptation by serial passage (or serial transmission): an adventitious virus (or other pathogen) can increase its biological adaptation to a new host species if it is rapidly transmitted between hosts, while each host is still in the acute infection period. This process favors the accumulation of adaptive mutations more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the immune system suppresses the virus. Such better adapted variant could then survive in the human host for longer than the short acute infection period, in high numbers (<b>high</b> <b>viral</b> <b>load),</b> which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.|$|E

Additionally, the haplotypes HLA-A*23-C*07 and HLA-A*02-C*16 typically expressed increased viral loads within the sample population of Zambians. One of the most effective HIV-inhibiting haplotypes was HLA-A*30-C*03 while one of the least effective was HLA-A*23*B*14.

The QuickVue Influenza A+B test {{is one of the}} most common tests for rapid {{diagnosis of}} influenza. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the test in children. Methods: We collected data from 970 patients with influenza-like illness who received rapid influenza antigen tests using the QuickVue Influenza A+B test as well as viral isolation. We compared the results with that of viral isolation and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Results: Based on viral culture, the QuickVue Influenza A+B test had an overall sensitivity of 0. 82 (419 / 513) and specificity of 0. 99 (70 / 71), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0. 74 (419 / 563) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0. 77 (313 / 407). The sensitivity of QuickVue was significantly higher in specimens with <b>high</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads.</b> If the <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> were less than 106, the sensitivity of QuickVue was 0. 62, while the sensitivity of QuickVue was 0. 88 if the <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> were <b>higher</b> than 106 (p< 0. 001). Logistic regression analysis showed that <b>higher</b> <b>viral</b> <b>loads</b> correlated with positive QuickVue results (p< 0. 001). On the first day of fever, the sensitivity of QuickVue was only 0. 67; on the second day, the sensitivity was 0. 86; on the third day, the sensitivity was 0. 98, and on the fourth day, the sensitivity was 0. 90.
