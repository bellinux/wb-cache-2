60|$|SILVER-WEED or <b>GOOSE-GRASS</b> (P. anserina).--Why {{dedicated}} to geese, even in Latin, {{it is hard}} to say. Silver-weed is more appropriate to the silver-grey leaves that border road-sides, sometimes with golden flowers.|$|E
60|$|I was {{forbidden}} {{to be alone}} in it. But Pollie would sometimes weary of her charge (in which I encouraged her) and when {{out of sight of}} the windows she would stray off to gossip with the gardener or with some friend from the village, leaving me to myself. To judge from the tales which I have read or have been told about children, I must have been old for my age. But perhaps the workings of the mind and heart of a girl in her teens are not of general interest. Let me be brief. A stream of water ran on the southern side all the length of the garden, under a high, rocky bank (its boundary) which was densely overhung with ash and willow, and hedges of brier and bramble looped with bindweed, <b>goose-grass,</b> and traveller's joy. On the nearer bank of this stream which had been left to its wild, I would sit among the mossy rocks and stones and search the green tops of my ambush as if in quest of Paradise.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little man}} did not shout nor sing for all his {{infinite}} gladness. He stood for a time like one awestricken, and then, with a queer small cry and holding out his arms, he ran out {{as if he would}} embrace at once the whole round immensity of the world. He did not follow the neat set paths that cut the garden squarely, but thrust across the beds and through the wet, tall, scented herbs, through the night-stock and the nicotine and the clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of southernwood and lavender, and knee-deep across a wide space of mignonette. He came to the great hedge, and he thrust his way through it; and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and tore threads from his wonderful suit, and though burrs and <b>goose-grass</b> and havers caught and clung to him, he did not care. He did not care, for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which he had longed. [...] "I am glad I put on my suit," [...] he said; [...] "I am glad I wore my suit." ...|$|E
60|$|Even among plants which {{trust to}} the {{involuntary}} services {{of animals in}} dispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be observed on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and <b>goose-grass,</b> two of the best-known instances among our common English weeds, each little nut is covered with many small hooks, which make it catch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals. These are the kinds we human beings of either sex oftenest find clinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But in herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near the middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually catches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after {{a short period of}} withering. Sometimes, too, the whole fruit is provided with prehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds themselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed by the common burdock. Here, an involucre or common cup-shaped receptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular flowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit; but the hooked involucre contains the whole compound mass, and, being pulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of the composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.|$|E
