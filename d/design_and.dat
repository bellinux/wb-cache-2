5|$|As {{the lead}} ship of the Majestic-class of light {{aircraft}} carriers, Melbourne was {{conceived as a}} modified version of the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck <b>design</b> <b>and</b> habitability. Majestic- and Colossus-class carriers were almost identical in hull <b>design</b> <b>and</b> both were considered subclasses of the '1942 design' light aircraft carrier program. These carriers were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.|$|E

Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E

5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to <b>design</b> <b>and</b> build a heavy lift ship for the Army.

5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and <b>design,</b> <b>and</b> is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural <b>design</b> <b>and</b> technology.|$|E
