Our analysis takes into consideration {{two types of}} effects: first, those associated {{with the loss of}} particle-antiparticle identity, {{as a result of the}} ill-defined nature of the CPT operator, and second, effects due to the non-unitary evolution of the Kaons in the space-time foam. By studying a variety of phi-factory observables, involving identical as well as general final states, we derive analytical expressions, to leading order in the associated CPT violating parameters, for double-decay rates and their time-integrated counterparts. Our analysis shows that the various types of the aforementioned effects may be disentangled through judicious combinations of appropriate observables in a phi factory.

40|$|In {{this work}} we generalize and {{subsequently}} apply the Effective Field Renormalization Group technique {{to the problem}} of ferro- and antiferromagnetically coupled Ising spins with local anisotropy axes in geometrically frustrated geometries (kagome and pyrochlore lattices). In this framework, we calculate the various ground states of these systems and the corresponding critical points. Excellent agreement is found with exact and Monte Carlo results. The effects of frustration are discussed. As pointed out by other authors, {{it turns out that the}} spin ice model can be exactly mapped to the standard Ising model but with effective interactions of the opposite sign to those in the original Hamiltonian. Therefore, the ferromagnetic spin ice is frustrated, and does not order. Antiferromagnetic spin ice (in both 2 and 3 dimensions), is found to undergo a transition to a long range ordered state. The thermal and magnetic critical exponents for this transition are calculated. It is found that the thermal exponent is that of the Ising universality class, whereas the magnetic critical exponent is different, as expected from the fact that the Zeeman term has a different symmetry in these systems. In addition, the recently introduced Generalized Constant Coupling method is also applied to the calculation of the critical points and ground state configurations. Again, a very good agreement is found with both exact, Monte Carlo, and renormalization group calculations for the critical points. Incidentally, we show that the generalized constant coupling approach can be regarded as the lowest order limit of the EFRG technique, in which correlations outside a frustrated unit are neglected, and scaling is substituted by strict equality of the thermodynamic quantities.

Fecha de lectura: 05 - 07 - 2010 PAX 5 {{is a key}} {{transcription factor}} involved in B cell commitment and maintenance. PAX 5 fulfills a dual role by repressing transcription of B cell lineage inappropriate genes and by activating expression of B cell specific genes. There is abundant scientific literature {{about the existence of}} genetic alterations comprising PAX 5 in hematological malignancies. However, epigenetic alterations of PAX 5, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, have not been investigated in detail in these neoplasias. In this doctoral thesis, the role of epigenetic regulation of the PAX 5 N-terminal isoforms, PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B, in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasias has been studied in depth. Initially, the DNA methylation status and expression of the PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B promoters was investigated in a subset of different human neoplasias, and hypermethylation was frequently observed in hematological malignancies of lymphoid origin, both in cell lines and primary cases. Interestingly, we have found that PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B can display differential DNA methylation status. To further study the importance of DNA methylation on the expression of both PAX 5 isoforms, the effect of the DNA demethylating agent 5 -aza- 2 ’-deoxycytidine was analyzed in lymphoid leukemia cell lines. In general, a good correlation between the DNA methylation status of PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B promoters and the expression levels of both isoforms in most cell lines was observed, confirming that DNA methylation is associated with gene repression. However, some exceptions were identified. In these cases in which PAX 5 was expressed in spite of the presence of DNA methylation, the simultaneous presence of activating histone modifications was observed. At the functional level, PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B silencing was associated with repression of B cell specific markers. Such repression could be reversed by ectopic expression of PAX 5 A and PAX 5 B or treatment with 5 -aza- 2 ’-deoxycytidine in T cell and B cell leukemia cell lines with epigenetic inactivation of PAX 5. Interestingly, not all these B cell markers could be reexpressed in the cell line of T cell origin. These findings suggest that PAX 5 alone is able to induce expression of B cell markers in B cells, whereas in T cells there should be other elements repressing the B cell program. <b>In</b> <b>conclussion,</b> this study provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of PAX 5 and its two N-terminal isoforms in B cells and suggests that PAX 5 hypermethylation is associated with the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies...|$|E

Supplementing B. brizantha hay (BBH) with Moringa significantly increased milk production from 3. 1 to 4. 9 and 5. 1 kg day- 1 when feeding BBH hay alone or with 2 kg or 3 kg DM of Moringa, respectively. Supplementation with Cratylia increased milk production from 3. 9 to 5. 1 and 5. 7 kg day- 1 for sorghum silage alone and supplementation with 2 kg and 3 kg DM of Cratylia, respectively. Milk composition and organoleptic characteristics were not significantly affected by feeding Moringa or Cratylia. The digestibility of DM, crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) increased (P< 0. 05) in the diets supplemented with Moringa compared to BBH alone. Supplementation with Cratylia did not affect digestibilities significantly, {{with the exception of}} CP digestibility, which increased (P< 0. 05) in the diets supplemented with Cratylia compared to sorghum silage alone. The cutting frequency of 75 days resulted in the highest DM yield from Moringa, 24. 7 and 10. 4 Mg ha- 1 year- 1, during the first and second year, respectively. DM yield from Cratylia increased from 8. 7 to 18. 2 Mg ha- 1 as harvest interval was prolonged from 8 to 16 weeks. All planting densities produced the highest DM yield at 75 days cutting frequency and at sixteen weeks harvest interval by Moringa and Cratylia, respectively. In the first year, the density of 750 000 plants ha- 1 of Moringa produced the highest DM yield, 18. 9 Mg ha- 1, but in the second year 500 000 plants ha- 1 gave the highest DM yield, 8. 1 Mg ha- 1. For Cratylia the density of 40 000 plants ha- 1 gave the highest DM yield (18. 2 Mg ha- 1). During the first year of growing Moringa, DM, NDF and ash contents were highest and IVDMD was lowest in the longest cutting frequency, while CP and ADF contents were not affected significantly by cutting frequency. In the second year DM and CP contents and IVDMD were not significantly affected by cutting frequency, whereas NDF, ADF and ash contents were lowest in the cutting frequency of 60 days.

40|$|Two {{different}} mechanisms {{participate in}} the loss of SFRPs expression in cancer cells: allelic loss and epigenetic silencing [1]. Methylation status in grade II and grade III glioma differs. From previous studies which were performed in Germany, 2010 by S. Gotze, M. Wolter, G. Reifenberger, O. Muller and S. Sievers [2], it is known that in grade II glioma SFRP 2 gene supposed to be methylated (12. 5 % - 2 samples from 16 were methylated), while in grade III glioma commonly is unmethylated (0 % - from 14 samples no samples were methylated). SFRP 2 gene mRNA expression decreases during transformation of grade II to grade III glioma, what’s why our researches were based on idea that SFRP 2 expression level decreases because of methylation on this gene. Secondly, another hypothesis we supported that SFRP 2 gene could be silenced due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH). IDH 1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) mutation occurs in tumor tissues while is absent in normal tissue. Third hypothesis which we done, that IDH 1 mutation is a common event in malignant glioma tissues, and can be used for glioma diagnostic as biomarker. Our object for this master thesis was to find SFRP 2 (Secreted frizzled related protein- 2) gene promoter methylation level in grade II and grade III gliomas. To compare the results with the results publicated in previous studies. The main goal of this thesis is to perform methylation study of the promoter region of SFRP 2 gene on 86 samples (42 WHO grade II gliomas, 40 WHO grade III gliomas and 4 non tumoral samples), and to achieve a search of SFRP 2 allele loss by a Loss of Heterozigosity (LOH) method. To find proportions between samples with and without IDH 1 mutations. The challenges of our project are: •	To control if the methylation occurs during the transformation of grade II to grade III glioma. To find the methylation status in grade II glioma and grade III. •	We next asked whether SFRP 2 promoter hypermethylation in grade II is functionally associated with loss of SFRP 2 mRNA expression in grade III glioma. To check if there is any correlation between SFRP 2 gene methylation and mRNA expression. •	To control LOH of 4 q chromosome position in high grade (III) glioma. •	To compare IDH 1 mutation occurrence in grade II and grade III glioma samples. To find correlation between methylation status and IDH 1 mutation. In general, DNA methylation patterns {{have been found to be}} correlated with tumour type and prognosis of various cancers and may therefore be helpful as diagnostic or prognostic marker. 1. 	Our results provide evidences that in 5 ’- CpG site methylation in SFRP 2 gene encoding Wnt pathway inhibitor protein is a more common alteration in grade III gliomas 32. 50 % (13 / 40), compared with grade II glioma 19. 05 % (8 / 42). SFRP 2 gene methylation level was 25. 61 % (21 / 82) in tumour samples. In contrast, no methylated SFRP 2 genes were detected in normal brain tissues. These results are antipathetic to results obtained by S. Gotze, M. Wolter G. Reifenberger, O. Muller and S. Sievers (Germany, 2009). They demonstrated what SFRP 2 promoter methylation is more common in grade II gliomas (12. 5 % - 2 samples from 16 were methylated), while in grade III gliomas SFRP 2 gene commonly are unmethylated (0 % - from 14 samples no samples were methylated). Furtermore, our data indicated that commonly methylation occurred in 3 of 4 grade II astrocytomas (75 %) and frequently grade III gliomas showing SFRP 2 promoter methylation were- 3 of 6 anaplastic astrocytomas (50 %), 6 of 17 anaplastic oligodendroglioma (35. 29 %). 2. 	A direct comparison of SFRP 2 mRNA expression and SFRP 2 promoter methylation indicates that in glioma cancer SFRP 2 methylation is correlated with loss of SFRP 2 mRNA expression. SFRP 2 mRNA expression was decreased in the methylated samples compared with no methylated. As well, both gliomas malignancy grades (grade II and grade III) demonstrated the same decrease of SFRP 2 mRNA expression in methylated samples. In grade II gliomas methylated samples SFRP 2 mRNA expression average were significantly smaller (3. 03125), compared with unmethylated samples (SFRP 2 expression average 12. 0147). In grade III gliomas for methylated samples SFRP 2 mRNA expression average is 1. 087, while for unmethylated is 5. 5217. <b>In</b> <b>conclussion,</b> these findings support our hypothesis that SFRP 2 gene expression decreased due to the epigenetic silencing of this gene caused by promoter hypermethylation. But the SFRP 2 promoter methylation can not be characterized like the main reason decreasing the SFRP 2 mRNA expression as methylation status is low- 25. 61 % (21 / 82) in tumour samples. Otherwise, this conclussion need to be clarified performing the same researches including more patients. 3. 	Approximetely 20 % (6 of 29 samples) grade III gliomas demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at the SFRP 2 gene locus. Commonly LOH occured in anaplastic oligoastrocytomas – 50 %. Also we found correlation between the methylated samples and LOH. 44 % methylated grade III glioma samples were with one allele lost. Methylation of SFRP 2 promoter and LOH at 4 q chromosome are dependent prognostic factors. It is clear that SFRP 2 mRNA expression decrease due to methylation, so this support the idea that LOH might, as well decrease the SFRP 2 expression. These findings have to be confirmed by comprehensive studies, and could be the good object for future investigations. 4. 	Gliomas frequently carry point mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH 1) gene which is clinically important as diagnostic and prognostic markers. Follow-up studies investigating larger series of different types of gliomas and other brain tumours confirmed frequent IDH 1 mutation in secondary glioblastoma but also in diffuse astrocytic, oligodendroglial and oligo- astrocytic gliomas of World Health Organisation (WHO) grades II and III. In our project after performing IDH 1 mutation searching method, 62 % of samples showed clear IDH 1 mutation in glioma samples, these findings verify recent studies done by Sanson et al. (2009) where they found that the majority 62 %- 88 % of analysed glioma samples carried IDH 1 mutation. In grade II glioma IDH 1 was found in 67, 5 % patients malignant brain tissues, and in grade III- 57 %. So, the difference between grade and IDH 1 mutation occurance is significantly low, just 10, 5 %. Equally, we might say what IDH 1 mutation is strongly associated with SFRP 2 methylation, as 75 % methylated grade II samples had IDH 1 mutation, and 54 % grade III also had IDH 1 mutation. IDH 1 mutation findings could be served as a useful tool for early glioma diagnostic, cancer preventions and treatment. Our project might be served as introduction part for new researches with wide interests. These might help to make the better comparison between the methylation status, LOH, SFRP 2 mRNA expression and Wnt pathway activation and its influence for glioma tumorogenesis. Centrinės nervų sistemos (CNS) gliomos yra navikai, kilę iš paraminio nervinio audinio, esančio smegenyse. Yra keletas skirtingų rūšių paraminio nervinio audinio ląstelių: astrocitų, oligodendrocitų ir ependimocitų. Pirminiai centrinės nervų sistemos navikai sudaro apie 2 % visų vėžių atveju. Tuo tarpu gliomos sudaro 64 - 72 % visų pirminių smegenų vėžių. Pirminiai CNS navikai yra lyderiaujanti priežastis, sukelianti vaikų mirtis ir ketvirtoje vietoje pagal svarbą įtakojanti suaugusiųjų (virš 54 metų) mirtis. Kasmet Jungtinėse Amerikos valstijose yra registruojama apie 14 000 naujų gliomų atveju, t. y. 5 nauji atvejai/ 100 000 gyventojų. Prancūzijoje šis skaičius yra 3000 naujų gliomų per metus, t. y. 8 nauji atvejai 100 000 gyventojų. Pagal statistinius duomenis, Lietuvoje 2001 metais buvo užregistruota 247 nauji pacientai sergantys gliomomis (7. 1 nauji atvejai / 100 000 gyventojų), o 2007 metais 211 naujų susirgimų gliomomis (6. 2 / 100 000 gyventojų). Pagal Pasaulinės Sveikatos Organizacijos (PSO) priimtus kriterijus (pyktibiškumo laipsnį) gliomos yra skirstomos į keturias stadijas : I- policitinė astrocitoma; II- astrocitoma, oligo-astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma; III- anaplastinė astrocitoma, anaplastinė oligoastrocitoma, anaplastinė oligodendrolglioma; IV- glioblastoma. Daugumos atliktų studijų metu nustatyta, jog gyvenimo prognozė labai priklauso nuo piktybiškumo laipsnio. I stadijos gliomos nėra pavojingos, po sėkmingo gydymo sergantieji išgyvena daug metų. II stadijos pacientai išgyvena nuo 3 iki 20 metų priklausomai nuo histologinio gliomų tipo ir kitų įtakojančių faktorių, tuo tarpu III stadijos gliomomis sergantieji išgyvena nuo 2 iki 10 metų. Blogiausiomis prognozėmis pasižymi glioblastomos, (PSO- IV) kuomet prognozės yra 1 - 2 išgyvenimo metai. Nors ir sergamumas yra sąlyginai mažas, labai svarbu kiek galima anksčiau nustatyti prognostinius faktorius, taikinius medikamentiniam gydymui, kurie padėtų užkirsti kelią gliomų plitimui. Šiame darbe norėjome ištirti II ir III stadijos gliomas. Mūsų studijų objektas buvo SFRP 2 (Sectreted frizzled related protein- 2) geno aktyvatoriaus metilinimo lygio nustatymas antroje ir trečioje gliomų stadijoje. SFRP 2 genas randamas 4 q 31. 3 chromosomos padėtyje. SFRP 2 genas yra charakterizuojamas kaip Wnt sistemos inhibitorius, įtakojantis šios sistemos aktyvaciją. Studijų metu yra nustatyta, jog Wnt sistema lemia vėžinių ląstelių vystymąsi leukemijos, skrandžio vėžio, krūtų vėžio ir kitais atvejais. 2010 metais publikavus S. Gotze studijas, buvo pristatyta Wnt sistemos įtaka gliomų vystymuisi. Šios sistemos aktyvacija yra neigiamas faktorius, lemiantis gliomų piktybiškumo didėjimą. Mes tyrėme 86 pacientų, kurie buvo hospitalizuoti A. De Villeneuve ligoninėje, Monteljė, Prancūzijoje navikus. 42 gliomos buvo II stadijos, 40 pacientų navikų buvo III stadijos gliomos ir 4 pacientų smegenų ląstelės buvo be vėžinių susirgimų. Histologiškai didžiąją dalį – 27 (32, 9 %) gliomų sudarė IIº oligoastrocitomos, 17 (20, 73 %) – IIºanaplastinės astrocitomos, 14 (17 %) – IIIanaplastinėsoligoastrocitomos. Pritaikius polimerazės grandinės reakcijas, vadovaujantis tiksliais protokolais ir naudojant atitinkamus reagentus, nustatėme jog SFRP 2 aktyvatoriaus metilinimas yra dažnesnis III stadijos gliomose 32. 50 % (13 / 40), lyginant su II stadijos gliomomis 19. 05 % (8 / 42). SFRP 2 geno metilinimo lygis 25. 61 % (21 / 82) gliomų navikų pavyzdžiuose. Tuo tarpu, sveikose smegenų ląstelėse, kurios buvo naudotos kontrolei, neaptikome SFRP 2 geno metilinimo. Gauti rezultatai yra skirtingi lyginant su S. Gotze, M. Wolter G. Reifenberger, O. Muller ir S. Sievers (Vokietija, 2009) publikuotomis studijomis, kuomet metilinimo lygis buvo didesnis II stadijos gliomose (12. 5 % - 2 pavyzdžiai iš 16 metilinti), kuomet III stadijos gliomose SFRP 2 genas buvo nemetilintas (0 % - iš 14 pavyzdžių nei viename nebuvo nustatytas metilinimas). Mūsų projekto rezultatai parodė, jog dažniausiai metilinimas pasireiškė 3 iš 4 IIº astrocitomose (75 %), 3 iš 6 anaplastinėse astrocitomose (35. 29 %), 6 iš 17 anaplastinėse oligodendrogliomose (pagal PSO IIIº) (50 %). Taip pat nustatėme, jog metilinti pavyzdžiai pasižymėjo mažesne SFRP 2 geno mRNA ekspresija. IIº gliomose metilintų pavyzdžių SFRP 2 mRNA ekspresijos vidutinė vertė ženkliai mažesnė (3. 03125), lyginant su nemetilintais pavyzdžiais (12. 0147). IIIº gliomose metilintų pavyzdžių SFRP 2 mRNA ekspresijos vidutinė vertė- 1. 087, kai neemetilintų pavyzdžių- 5. 5217. Mokslininkų nustatyta, jog SFRP 2 ekspresija labai sumažėja didėjant gliomų piktybiškumui, mes taip pat pagrindėme šiuos įrodymus. Sekantis tikslas mūsų studijose buvo nustatyti SFRP 2 geno heterozigotiškumo netekimą, kuris taip pat gali įtakoti mRNA ekspresijos sumažėjimą. Tyrėme tik III stadijos pacientus, kadangi IIIº gliomose mRNA ekspresija yra labai sumažėjusi (4. 043) lyginant su IIº (10, 218). Nustatėme jog LOH- heterozigotiškumo netekimas pasireiškė 6 pavyzdžiuose, tai sudarė 20 % tiriamųjų. Iš jų 4 pavyzdžiai (67 %) buvo metilinti. Taip pat ištyrėmė IDH 1 (izokrito dehidrogenazės 1) mutaciją 82 pacientuose (42 IIº gliomos, 40 IIIº). Nustatėme jog IDH 1 mutacija buvo būdinga 51 tiriamajam pavyzdžiui, t. y. 62 % tiriamųjų, iš kurių 29 II stadijos gliomos ir 22 III stadijos gliomos. 23 % - 19 pavyzdžių mutacijos neaptikome ir 15 %- 12 pavyzdžių gauti rezultatai buvo nepakankamai aiškūs vertinti. Pagal histologinį tipą dažniausiai IDH 1 mutacija pasireiškė II stadijos gliomose- astrocitomose (4 / 4 – 100 %), oligodendrogliomose (17 / 27 - 63 %), oligoastrocitomose (63 %- 6 / 9), ir III stadijos gliomose- anaplastinėse oligodendrogliomose (64 % - 11 / 17), anaplastinėse astrocitomose ir anaplastinėse oligoastrocitomose nustatytas IDH 1 mutacijos pasireiškimas sudarė vienodą dalį procentų, t. y. 50 %. Taipogi, 62 % (13 / 21) metilintų pavyzdžių buvo su IDH 1 mutacija. II gliomų stadijoje 75 % metilintų pavyzdžių turėjo ir IDH 1 mutaciją, o III gliomų stadijoje 54 %. Išvados. Metilinimas SFRP 2 geno aktyvatoriuje yra blogos prognozės požymis. Dažniau pasireiškiantis III gliomų stadijoje ir įtakojantis SFRP 2 geno mRNA ekspresijos sumažėjimą. Heterozigotiškumo netekimas yra sąlyginai nedidelis III stadijos gliomose, tačiau akivaizdžiai susijęs su SFRP 2 geno aktyvatoriaus metilinimu ir mRNA ekspresijos sumažėjimu. IDH 1 mutacijos pasireiškimas yra dažnas įvykis vėžinėse ląstelėse, o taip pat ir analizuojant II ir III stadijos gliomas. Dažniau nustatomas pavyzdžiuose, kuriems būdingas ir SFRP 2 geno metilinimas. Svarbu ir toliau atlikti išsamesnius, didesnės apimties tyrimus, įtraukiant kiek galima daugiau pacientų, kadangi kolkas daugumoje mokslo literatūros šaltinių pateikiami duomenys yra skirtingi dėl nedidelio skaičiaus ligonių juose. Epigenetiniai tyrimai yra svarbūs siekiant nustatyti pakitimus, vykstančius vėžinio proceso metu, rasti faktorius, lemiančius prognozę, padedančius parinkti gydymo taktiką, nuspėti atsaką į gydymą. Genų ištyrimas, jų mutacijų ir pakitimų nustatymas yra naudingas siekiant sudaryti schemas, kuriomis remiantis būtų galima parinkti tinkamiausią ir efektyviausią gydymą, taip pat žinant daugeliui pacientų būdingus pakitimus, genų mutacijas būtų galima lengviau diagnozuoti vėžinius susirgimus, nustatyti išgyvenamumo prognozes, bei koncentruotis į naujų vaistų taikinių paieškas. Epigenetiniai tyrimai tai yra pradinis žingsnis vaistų taikinių paieškoje ir naujų vaistų kūrime, kadangi sintezė yra neatsiejama nuo analizės. Tik tobulėjimas moksliniuose tyrimuose ir tuo pačiu epigenetikos srityje gali mums suteikti papildomas galimybes siekiant sukurti efektyvius gydymo būdus ir sumažinti mirtingumą, sergančiujų gliomomis...|$|E
