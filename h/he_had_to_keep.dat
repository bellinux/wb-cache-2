25|$|Demanding concert tour {{schedules}} caused Rachmaninoff's output as {{a composer}} to slow significantly, so that between {{his arrival in}} the US in 1918 and his death in 1943, he completed just six compositions. Clearly his composition time was limited because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> performing to support his family, but also his nostalgia for Russia seemed to dampen his compositional creativity. So demanding was his schedule that he termed his concert season 'harvest time’, becoming increasingly disillusioned, and entrenched {{in the idea of}} his being a failure: ‘I was born a failure and therefore I bear all the burdens that are inseparably part of this status,’ he wrote to Yevgeny Somov in 1923. Despite Rachmaninoff’s concerns, he was lauded by the American public, who loved seeing the famous composer of their favourite Prelude in C-sharp minor.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Rosenblat and {{his wife}} had run into serious {{financial}} problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him. According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> lying and live with it.|$|E
25|$|By 1849, Njegoš began {{experiencing}} an incessant {{cough and}} soon a doctor from Kotor {{discovered that he}} had tuberculosis. By early 1850, {{it was clear that}} the condition was life-threatening. Painfully aware that Montenegro did not have a single trained physician, he travelled to Kotor in the spring and composed his last will and testament, intending for it to prevent the power struggle that had preceded his own accession to the position of vladika. He mailed the will to vice-consul Gagić in Dubrovnik with a message asking him to return the document unopened in the event that he regained his health. Njegoš then headed to Venice and Padova, where he spent much time resting and seemingly succeeded in containing his illness. His cough returned after eight days; he left Padova and went back to Montenegro in the hope that the country's fresh mountain air would alleviate his symptoms. He spent the summer of 1850 resting and writing poetry. His condition prevented him from lying down, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in a constant upright position, even when sleeping. By November 1850, the cough abated and Njegoš undertook another journey to Italy. He reached Italy in January 1851, and travelled through Venice, Milan, Genoa and Rome. He visited the ruins of Pompeii with Serbian writer Ljubomir Nenadović, and the two men travelled together along Italy's western coast discussing philosophy and contemporary politics. The journey was documented in a book Nenadović published following Njegoš's death, titled Letters from Italy.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} filmed using five directors. Wood {{directed}} {{eight of the}} thirteen episodes; he spent 17 days preparing to film the premiere. He found that [...] "Requiem" [...] was his favorite episode to direct, while [...] "The Five" [...] was his least favorite, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> reorganizing six styrofoam sets. Among the remaining five episodes, James Head directed [...] "Folding Man", Peter DeLuise directed [...] "Nubbins", Brenton Spencer directed [...] "Edward" [...] and [...] "Warriors", and Steven A. Adelson directed [...] "Instinct"; Adelson filmed the episode with 40 long takes to accomplish a real-time perspective. DeLuise was approached by Wood to direct [...] "Nubbins" [...] as it was considered a lighter episode, which DeLuise preferred over a dramatic episode. In the past DeLuise would make cameo appearances in his works, but broke tradition in directing this episode.|$|E

He needed to use a liquid that was heavier than water, and from his previous association and suggestions by Galileo, he deduced by using mercury, a shorter tube could be used.

2500|$|Twain and {{his family}} closed down their {{expensive}} Hartford home {{in response to the}} dwindling income and moved to Europe in June 1891. William M. Laffan of The New York Sun and the McClure Newspaper Syndicate offered him the publication of a series of six European letters. Twain, Olivia, and their daughter Susy were all faced with health problems, and they believed that it would be of benefit to visit European baths. The family stayed mainly in France, Germany, and Italy until May 1895, with longer spells at Berlin (winter 1891/92), Florence (fall and winter 1892/93), and Paris (winters and springs 1893/94 and 1894/95). During that period, Twain returned four times to New York due to his enduring business troubles. He took [...] "a cheap room" [...] in September 1893 at $1.50 per day at The Players Club, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> until March 1894; meanwhile, he became [...] "the Belle of New York," [...] in the words of biographer Albert Bigelow Paine.|$|E
2500|$|Piper's {{next major}} storyline was with Hulk Hogan and also {{involved}} pop singer Cyndi Lauper. In 1985, MTV broadcast The War to Settle the Score, which featured a main-event match between Piper and Hogan, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by Lauper, Captain Lou Albano, and Mr. T. This event set up the very first WrestleMania, which pitted Paul Orndorff and his former manager Piper against Hogan and Mr. T. Orndorff was pinned by Hogan when Piper's bodyguard [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton interfered and mistakenly struck Orndorff instead of Hogan. In Born to Controversy, Piper recalled how during the match <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Mr. T busy to cover Mr. T's lack of wrestling ability from being seen by the fans. From this situation, Piper and Mr. T's real-life relationship became hostile, leading to the inevitable conclusion that they be put into a feud with one another on-screen. Piper faced Mr. T in a boxing match at WrestleMania 2 in 1986, which Piper lost by disqualification after bodyslamming Mr. T.|$|E

2500|$|On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed {{to testify}} before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Alone among the many {{witnesses}} after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the Fifth Amendment (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his First Amendment rights: [...] "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this." [...] Seeger's refusal to answer questions that violated his fundamental Constitutional rights led to a March 26, 1957, indictment for contempt of Congress; for some years, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten 1-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "Once you've {{been labeled}} as a genius, {{you have to}} {{continue}} it or your name becomes mud. I am {{a victim of the}} recording industry. I didn't think I was a genius. I thought I had talent. But I didn't think I was a genius." [...] Parks echoed that Taylor's line [...] "forced Brian Wilson to have to continuously prove that he's a genius and not just a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent {{and a lot of people}} collaborating beautifully around him." [...] To expand his creative conceptions, Wilson turned to drugs, which Love says ultimately became his undoing: [...] "It was hard enough to match the Beatles, but now <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with Mozart?". By 1967, Wilson said that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". After 1967's Wild Honey, he relinquished his creative hold on the Beach Boys. } From 1968 onward, his songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of [...] "Brian-as-leader" [...] continued. Following the 1969 termination of their contract to Capitol Records, the band's new contract with Reprise stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums. Producer Terry Melcher remembered how in one recording session from 1975, Wilson refused to go near the mixing board: [...] "He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; sometimes, I feel that he feels that he's peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize." ...|$|E
