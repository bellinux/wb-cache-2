40|$|The {{question}} of the law applicable {{to the protection of}} incapable foreign <b>domiciliaries</b> has generated much controversy in private international law. Arguments have favoured application either of the law of the foreign domicile or of the local law, yet neither solution has been consistently adopted.

He therefore argues in favour of a disjunctive reference of such questions to {{one or the other of}} the two laws in conflict, depending on which best serves the objective of protection of the incapable. Such a solution is incompatible with the unilateral application of the law of the forum, and notions of governmental interest or laws of « immediate application » are therefore inapplicable...|$|R

40|$|Under what {{circumstances}} may a United States court exercise personal jurisdiction over alien defendants? Courts and commentators {{have yet to}} offer a coherent response to this question. That is surprising given that scholars have been calling for the globalization of U. S. law since the late 1980 s {{as part of a}} transnational litigation narrative. Through doctrinal and empirical analysis, this Article argues that a U.

2500|$|Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, {{with certain}} exceptions, a state is obligated {{to honor the}} {{judgments}} and declarations of other states. While some assert that a [...] "license" [...] {{could be construed as}} a [...] "judgment", the majority of legal scholars disagree. However, it is pointed out that a judgment for divorce is required to be honored because judgments are required to be enforced by out-of-state jurisdictions, regardless of whether those judgments are against the public policy of the out state forum (see Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 (1942) (the case also stated that there is no [...] "authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its <b>domiciliaries,</b> to the statutes of any other state")). Because of the intricacies of family law and the mobility of married couples, the recognition of marriages in other states varies. The need for clarification on state uniformity in this issue requires a constitutional amendment at the federal level, particularly considering there will be a flood of marriages in out-of-state jurisdictions for purposes of obtaining a same-sex marriage license.|$|R
40|$|Institutions for {{the aged}} {{represent}} an organized {{effort on the part}} of society and various individuals., groups, and organizations to provide for and capitalize on the service needs of elderly persons no longer able to live independently in the community. These settings have been brought into existence and are maintained by various commercial, civic, voluntary, government, and other interest groups. The motives and interests of such groups vary; nevertheless, these settings offer services to consumers, provide employment to members of various professional and occupational groups, provide an arena for the involvement of various scholastic disciplines and professional associations, and benefit individuals and families related to the residents who live temporarily or permanently in institutions or otherwise also utilize the services offered in such settings. Institutions {{for the aged}} provide opportunities for business profits, and involvement for legislative, administrative, and regulatory public agencies. Viewing institutions for the aged with an organizational analysis frame of reference, therefore, should enhance our understanding of the salient factors which facilitate or constrain the operation of such settings and the services provided which, in turn, affect the level of well-being of elderly and disabled persons utilizing these services on a temporary or permanent basis. Using organizational analysis as a guiding framework, a model for the comprehension and better understanding of institutions for the aged will be developed and discussed.

40|$|Custody {{determinations}} {{traditionally have}} comprised a subcategory of litigation under the Pennoyer v. Neff exception for proceedings relating to status. Of course, states {{have the power}} to decide the status of their <b>domiciliaries.</b> It was natural, therefore, for the courts and scholars of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} to consider domicile the sole basis of jurisdiction in custody matters. Gradually, judges and scholars began to challenge the notion that domicile was the sole basis and courts began to apply other bases, such as the child 2 ̆ 7 s presence in the state or personal jurisdiction over both parents. One commentator suggests that the “true rule” with regard to jurisdiction “is the court 2 ̆ 7 s discretion exclusively governed by the child 2 ̆ 7 s welfare. ” In 1953, the United States Supreme Court announced that a court was required by the Constitution to have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a custody action. Until 1953, state courts were virtually free of federal limits to their power to set their own jurisdictional standards in custody cases. Since that date, the Supreme Court has not deigned to stir again the muddy waters of child custody jurisdiction, to impose jurisdictional limitations or to consider whether or not the Full Faith and Credit Clause applies to custody cases. In this atmosphere of virtually no jurisdictional limitations, state courts were aggressive in asserting initial jurisdiction in custody cases without the presence of domicile. Courts commonly asserted jurisdiction in cases in which it was clear that courts in other jurisdictions potentially had jurisdiction and an interest in asserting it. Some even asserted jurisdiction in those cases in which a court in another state had already asserted its jurisdiction. In addition, courts that issued custody decrees invariably retained jurisdiction over the subject matter in order to be able to modify the decree if circumstances changed and so required. The Full Faith and Credit Clause has been held to require only the same deference and same effect to a judgment of a sister state that a state gives to its own decrees or judgments. Courts of states which had not rendered the initial custody judgment thus felt justified in asserting jurisdiction in order to modify a sister state 2 ̆ 7 s custody decree. In 1947, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the notion that a custody judgment from a sister state is not due any more final or conclusive effect than it has in the law of the sister state; it is modifiable for changed circumstances. Inconsistencies were the inevitable result of courts 2 ̆ 7 attempts to struggle with staid notions of jurisdiction in an era of tremendous mobility in the face of the important need to protect children. A child 2 ̆ 7 s role in the custody adjudication process is significantly different from the role of a party to the lawsuit. Generally, the child plays a passive role, in contrast to the active role played by each of the adversaries. Nevertheless, the child always has a great interest in the outcome of the custody litigation, given the child 2 ̆ 7 s peculiar vulnerability and the fact that his or her fate is ultimately connected with the fortunes of the litigants. Because of the child 2 ̆ 7 s vulnerable role in a custody dispute, and because of his or her lack of freedom of choice or movement, the rules traditionally applicable to jurisdiction in other cases are not appropriate in custody cases. Difficult cases are, of course, likely, whatever system is adopted...|$|R
