5|$|A <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{role of the}} C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 in {{the folding}} and <b>folding</b> {{stability}} <b>of</b> staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was investigated by deletion mutation. The C-terminal truncated SNase fragments, SNase 137, SNase 139, SNase 140, and SNase 141 containing residues 1 - 137, 1 - 139, 1 - 140, and 1 - 141, respectively, were adopted in this study. <b>Folding</b> states <b>of</b> these four SNase fragments were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. The solution structure of SNase 140 was determined and compared to those of SNase 141 and native SNase using the heteronuclear NMRmethod. The results showed that <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the four SNase fragments is correlated with the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3. With the chain length extending from L 137 and I 139 to S 141, <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the fragments progressively approached to the tertiary <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> native SNase, and the folding stability was enhanced. These observations revealed that the C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 has profound effect {{not only on the}} <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3 but also on the stabilizing <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> both theR- and β-subdomains of SNase. Analysis indicates that stabilizing <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the SNase and SNase fragments depends to a large extent on the hydrophobic packing interactions in both the C-terminal local structural region surrounding W 140 including the loop L 137 -S 141 and the N-terminal local structural region of the “β-barrel ” hydrophobic core.

5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E

Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is {{as a result of the}} rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
40|$|AbstractScrambled isomers (X-isomers) {{are fully}} oxidized, {{non-native}} isomers of disulfide proteins. They {{have been shown}} to represent important intermediates along the pathway <b>of</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> numerous disulfide proteins. A simple method to assess whether X-isomers present as folding intermediate is to conduct oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> fully reduced protein in the alkaline buffer alone without any supplementing thiol catalyst or redox agent. Cardiotoxin-III (CTX-III) contains 60 amino acids and four disulfide bonds. The mechanism <b>of</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III has been systematically characterized here by analysis of the acid trapped <b>folding</b> intermediates. <b>Folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III was shown to proceed sequentially through 1 -disulfide, 2 -disulfide, 3 -disulfide and 4 -disulfide (scrambled) isomers as folding intermediates to reach the native structure. When <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III was performed in the buffer alone, more than 97 % of the protein was trapped as 4 -disulfide X-isomers, unable to convert to the native structure due to the absence of thiol catalyst. In the presence of thiol catalyst (GSH) or redox agents (GSH/GSSG), the recovery of native CTX-III was 80 – 85 %. These results demonstrate that X-isomers play an essential and predominant role in the oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> CTX-III...|$|R

5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a semi-quantitative agreement with the complex response observed in the experiment, allowing one to discuss the process in unprecedented detail.

5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E

Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> black Highland cattle on Churchill Island. They were seen and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been growing and semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|E

5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point strongly toward {{the importance of}} highly alpha-helical intermediates in the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> all globular proteins, regardless of their native structure. However, experimental refolding studies demonstrate no observable alpha-helical intermediate during refolding of some beta-sheet proteins and have dampened enthusiasm for this model <b>of</b> protein <b>folding.</b> In this study, beta-sheet proteins were hypothesized to have potential to form amphiphilic helices at a period of < 3. 6 residues/turn that matches or exceeds the potential at 3. 6 residues/turn. Hypothetically, such potential {{is the basis for}} an effective and unidirectional mechanism by which highly alpha-helical intermediates might be rapidly disassembled during folding and potentially accounts for the difficulty in detecting highly alpha-helical intermediates during the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> some proteins. The presence of this potential was confirmed, indicating that a model entailing ubiquitous formation of alpha-helical intermediates during the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> globular proteins predicts previously unrecognized features of primary structure. Further, the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> fatty acid binding protein, a predominantly beta-sheet protein that exhibits no apparent highly alpha-helical intermediate during folding, was dramatically accelerated by 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, a solvent that stabilizes alpha-helical structure. This observation suggests that formation of an alpha-helix can be a rate-limiting step during <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> a predominantly beta-sheet protein and further supports the role of highly alpha-helical intermediates in the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> all globular proteins...|$|R
