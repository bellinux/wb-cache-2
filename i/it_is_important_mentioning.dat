However, the only variable constant in all models is the belief that other drivers exceed speed limits. This indicates that independently from the type of road, drivers exceeding speed limits use as a justification that other drivers exceed speed limits.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Health {{services}} {{are composed of}} complex work environments. For this reason, they present several risks {{to the health of}} workers and also of people being treated at these places. Among these risks, one that is peculiar to health services is the risk of occupational accidents with biological material involving sharps. Objective: This study aimed to describe a health education activity conducted in a Health Center of the Federal District, Brazil. Methods: This is an experience report that discusses the final paper of the discipline “Administration Applied to Nursing and Internship”, offered by the Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia. A lecture was prepared, aimed at health workers and support staff, on general aspects of occupational accidents involving sharps, as well as preventive aspects. Results: In each clinical room of the Health Center were fixed two posters: the first discussing the proper disposal of sharps and the second, in turn, was a message of reflection. 31 professionals attended the lecture as listeners. Conclusion: We understand the validity of the lecture delivered, based on scientific studies that highlight the need and shortage of health education activities that address the prevention of occupational accidents involving sharps among Health Professionals. Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>mentioning</b> that such activity demand was estimated by the workers of the Health Center in study...|$|E
