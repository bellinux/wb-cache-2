Mooney describes his television reviews as [...] "notably punchy" [...] and The Times wrote, [...] "Levin took out his shotgun and let loose with both barrels". Levin gave the opening programmes a kindly review, but by the fourth day of commercial television {{he was beginning to}} baulk: [...] "There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> to get our teeth into apart from three [...] different brands of cake-mix and a patent doughnut". Thereafter, he did not spare the network: [...] "cliché succeeded to cliché"; [...] "a mentally defective aborigine who was deaf in both ears would have little difficulty in leaving 'Double Your Money' £32 richer than when he entered"; and after the network's first hundred days he attributed its viewing figures to the [...] "number of people who are sufficiently stupid to derive pleasure from such programmes".|$|E

500|$|Dance Again... The Hits {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on four reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Sal Cinquenmani of Slant Magazine {{wrote that the}} [...] "most immediately striking thing" [...] about the compilation is [...] "just how many hits [...] has racked up over the years". [...] "So many, in fact, that there's a hefty handful of singles missing from the standard edition of the album", using her number-one single [...] "All I Have" [...] {{as an example of}} this. He stated that Lopez's [...] "output <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> if not on trend", and that Dance Again... The Hits plays not only as a chronicle of her music career, but of [...] "pop music as a whole since just {{before the turn of the}} century", with genres spanning Latin pop, dance, and R. According to Cinquenmani, the album also serves as a [...] "historical record" [...] of who the rappers du jour were [...] "over the last dozen years or so", from Big Pun, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, and Lil Wayne. He concluded by stating that if the compilation [...] "proves anything" [...] it's that Lopez is, [...] "if not the queen, then at least the duchess of reinvention and should never be counted out".|$|E

How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ...

In contrast, Joseph Drolet, who prosecuted Williams at trial, has stood by Williams' convictions, noting that after Williams was arrested, [...] "the murders stopped and there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> since." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fowler's {{outstanding}} {{all round}} batting and bowling performance allowed Eton {{to win a}} match that appeared all but lost after Harrow School asked Eton to follow on 165 runs in arrears. [...] Wisden stated that: [...] "In {{the whole history of}} cricket, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> more sensational" [...] and The Times said that [...] "A more exciting match can hardly ever have been played", continuing effusively, with a reference to the inaugural Ashes Test at The Oval in 1882, [...] "to boys the bowling of Fowler was probably more formidable than Spofforth's to England". [...] Fowler ended the match having scored 21 and 64 runs, and taken 4-90 and 8-23. [...] The Times described Fowler's contribution in the following terms: [...] "in the whole history of public school cricket nothing better can have been seen than Fowler's play on the second day".|$|E
2500|$|Fowler's {{match is}} the name given to the two-day Eton v Harrow cricket match held at Lord's on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 July 1910. The match is named after the captain of Eton College, Robert St Leger Fowler, whose {{outstanding}} all round batting and bowling performance allowed Eton to win the match by 9 runs after Harrow School asked Eton to follow on 165 runs in arrears after the teams' first innings. When the ninth Eton wicket fell in their second innings, they led by only four runs, and Harrow's eventual target was just 55.

2500|$|On 2 June 1918, the 27th Aero Squadron {{entered into}} combat operations. [...] The first patrol was uneventful, and it {{accomplished}} its objective. Many in the squadron were rather surprised as there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> exciting, that the pock-marked lines seemed so quiet, and no Germans {{were in the}} air. The fact was that we failed to realize the danger, but that was soon to change. Over {{the next several days}} the squadron began a routine of three scheduled patrols, lasting about an hour each, and then three or four voluntary patrols each day. On 4 June, the squadron performed seven patrols with the object of keeping enemy observation photographers from coming over. [...] The squadron engaged in combat with the German Air Force on several patrols, and on 13 June, Lt Plyer was reported missing after being shot down in a combat with German planes, and later was reported to be a prisoner. In the days that followed, saw a continence of these same types of patrols. [...] On 25 June, orders came to be ready to move to the Chateau Thierry Sector.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars have {{extensively}} {{criticized the}} decision. [...] According to Professor Bethany Berger, [...] "By patching together {{bits and pieces}} of history and isolated quotes from nineteenth century cases, and relegating contrary evidence to footnotes or ignoring it altogether, the majority created a legal basis for denying jurisdiction out of whole cloth." [...] Rather than legal precedent, the holding was [...] "dictated by the Court's assumptions that tribal courts could not fairly exercise jurisdiction over outsiders and that the effort to exercise such jurisdiction was a modern upstart of little importance to tribal concerns. [...] Professor Philip Frickey describes Oliphant, along with the subsequent decisions limiting tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, as rooted in a “normatively unattractive judicial colonial impulse,” while Professor Robert Williams condemns the decision as [...] "legal auto-genocide" [...] According to Dr. Bruce Duthu, the case showed [...] "that the project of imperialism {{is alive and well in}} Indian Country and that courts can now get into the action." [...] Professor Duthu continues"The Oliphant Court essentially elevated a local level conflict between a private citizen and an Indian tribe into a collision of framework interests between two sovereigns, and in the process revived the most negative and destructive aspects of colonialism as it relates to Indian rights. This is a principal reason the decision has attracted so much negative reaction...Oliphant's impact on the development of federal Indian law and life on the ground in Indian Country <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> short of revolutionary. The opinion gutted the notion of full territorial sovereignty as it applies to Indian tribes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a glint in her eye as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E
