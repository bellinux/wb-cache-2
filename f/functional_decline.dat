40|$|This study {{examines}} how acute and chronic stresses associated with <b>functional</b> <b>declines</b> in seniors {{and their spouses}} are moderated by their informal and formal support contexts. In the United States, states vary greatly in their support for home and community-based services (HCBS) for seniors with disabilities. This state-to-state variation allowed us to examine mental health effects {{of living in a}} society supportive of HCBS for the oldest old, who are at high risk for low or declining functions in daily activities and cognitive abilities. Using a ten-year panel study of a nationally representative sample of the oldest old (>= 70 years old) covering the period 1993 - 2002, we conducted mixed-effects logistic regression analysis to incorporate time-varying characteristics of persons and states. As expected, low and declining functions in daily living and cognition constituted significant stressors among seniors and their spouse. Results demonstrated the important role of informal support available from non-spouse family/friends in lowering depression. Living in a state supportive of HCBS was associated with lower depression among seniors experiencing consistently low levels of function or recent <b>functional</b> <b>declines,</b> especially among those without informal support. Our findings were consistent with moderating or buffering models of formal support, suggesting that state HCBS support is effective mainly under conditions of high levels of stressors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of {{baseline}} socio-economic factors on <b>functional</b> status <b>decline</b> over a period of 3 years among a sample of Chinese older men and women, using the China Health and Nutrition Surveys of 1997 and 2000. In addition, the study tries to determine whether risk differentials by these socio-economic factors can be explained by other demographic, health-related and nutritional risk factors. The eligible study population was defined as women and men aged 55 years and over who at baseline were free from any form of disablement in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tasks. Among subjects with complete data at followed-up (N= 976), the overall incidence proportions of any <b>functional</b> status <b>decline,</b> IADL only and ADL declines were 25. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 6. 9 %, respectively. Our study found that education is strongly and inversely associated with incidence of combined <b>functional</b> status <b>decline</b> and IADL only but not with the onset of ADL disability. Similarly, household income per capita was inversely associated with <b>functional</b> status <b>decline</b> and IADL disability incidence, with a clear dose-response relationship, even after adjustment for age and gender. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the latter association was highly confounded by other demographic factors, especially urban-rural area of residence. Using a combined measure of socio-economic status that includes years of education and household income per capita, the age and gender-adjusted odds ratio for <b>functional</b> status <b>decline</b> and belonging to lower SES class as compared to middle, upper middle and upper classes was 3. 82 (95 % CI: 2. 15, 6. 77) and 2. 77 (95 % CI: 1. 52, 5. 03) after further adjustment for urban-rural area of residence and living arrangements. Hence, there are wide socio-economic disparities in the functional health of older adults in China, although such disparities are more seen for IADL decline and are almost exclusively attributed to differentials in educational attainment. Finally, nutritional and health-related risk factors do not seem to act as intermediate factors in this association and hence further research should try to uncover other mechanisms by which SES affects changes in functional health among older adults in China.
