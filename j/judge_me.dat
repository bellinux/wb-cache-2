[...] After putting his short film career behind him, Ostrum declined reporters and interviews, preferring not to speak on the subject; [...] "I wanted people to <b>judge</b> <b>me</b> on who I was, not what I’d done".

[...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark.

[...] "If I had released another album of just rancheras, people would have just expected the same thing, and then they would have begun to <b>judge</b> <b>me</b> by that one [...] theme", Fernández explained.

After hearing Fernández's proposal, Emilio Estefan agreed on the idea to produce the album.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because they were afraid of the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted to show people that I do what I say", he said. [...] "Now they can <b>judge</b> <b>me</b> in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
