40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} equivalences between an efficient solution of a bicriteria {{program and a}} lower envelope point of a certain image set of the bicriteria program. We also employ various kinds of approachabilities to characterize efficiency and proper efficiency for nonconvex bicriteria programs. In particular, nonlinear Lagranian functions are applied to construct dual problems and to study stability for the corresponding constrained scalar optimization problems. Under certain conditions we show that the finite approachability, proper efficiency, stability, and exact penalization of the relevant constrained scalar optimization problems are <b>equivalent.</b> <b>Department</b> of Applied Mathematic...|$|E

Public health Emergency Operations Centers (PHEOCs) can be epidemic intelligence hubs by 1) having the capacity to receive, analyze, and visualize multiple data streams, including surveillance and 2) maintaining a trained workforce that can analyze and interpret data from real-time emerging events. Such PHEOCs could be physically located within a ministry of health epidemiology, surveillance, or <b>equivalent</b> <b>department</b> rather than exist as a stand-alone space and serve as operational hubs during nonoutbreak times but in emergencies can scale up according to the traditional Incident Command System structure. 29155649 PMC 571130...|$|E
40|$|The {{major problem}} in the Department of Defense's {{acquisition}} of software systems is {{the growing number of}} cost and schedule overruns that result in failed software acquisitions. Cost and schedule overruns are the consequence of the software development models selected, inaccurate estimation of size, time, and cost, the instability of user requirements, and poor decision-making by acquisition managers. Commercial practices of requirements definition, vendor selection, development process, business practices, integration, development, and testing, maintenance, and rights in data were compared with <b>equivalent</b> <b>Department</b> of Defense practices. Commercial solutions are the implementation of open source standards and architectures, iterative software developments, increased collaboration among competing vendors, and the incorporation of software reuse. The Department of Defense's non-profit venture capital models utilize key practices, such as deal syndication and incremental funding, which are instrumental in managing risk and could be incorporated into how the DoD acquires software.

40|$|The growing {{presence}} of electronic anesthesia record keeping and perioperative informatics systems is {{contributing to a}} database of valuable information that can significantly improve patient care and patient outcomes. Efforts such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project and the Surgical Care Improvement Project have analyzed quality measures that directly correlate to patient outcomes. Several of these quality indicators {{are influenced by the}} performance of anesthesia providers’ activities in the perioperative period. These programs promote timely administration of preoperative antibiotics. One of their guidelines states that preoperative antibiotic should be given within an hour prior to surgical incision. Surgical site infections are the most common postoperative complication. Reducing postoperative complications can reduce health care costs, and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. The purpose of this project was to utilize an electronic feedback mechanism to improve anesthesia providers’ documentation of timely preoperative antibiotic administration. Electronic feedback reminders in the form of screensaver dashboards displaying updated departmental timely antibiotic percentage metrics for the day, the past week, and the past month were displayed for 16 weeks. Text messages were delivered once a week for 6 weeks showing an anesthesia providers’ prior average one week on time antibiotic along with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>department</b> on time average. The measures were effective in improving the documentation of timely antibiotic administration...|$|E

50|$|For over a decade, {{there were}} no direct faculty {{appointments}} to the program and all faculty teaching in the program was done by members of established Boards of Studies (at the time, the UC Santa Cruz <b>equivalent</b> of <b>departments).</b> This led to problems in budgeting and program continuity, and coupled with the unorthodox interdisciplinary nature of the program, it also presented challenges in placing History of Consciousness graduates in teaching jobs.

40|$|In {{flexible}} Naive Bayesian (FNB), {{the excellent}} qualities of Gaussian kernel {{have been demonstrated}} by the theoretical analyses and experimental comparisons with normal Naive Bayesian(NNB). There are also several types of kernel functions commonly used for probability density estimation, i. e., uniform, triangular, epanechnikov, biweight, triweight and cosine. We call them discontinuous kernels. In this paper, we verify the feasibility and efficiency of applying these alternative kernels in FNB. Our works mainly focus on three aspects: firstly, we give the application conditions of these kernels for the given domain data by analyzing the structural difference between the discontinuous kernel and Gaussian kernel; secondly, the equivalent probability is proposed to improve the capabilities of discontinuous kernels when such problem of kernel incapability occurs; finally, {{we carry out the}} experimental demonstration of our proposed method based on 15 UCI datasets. The results show that the discontinuous kernels can obtain better classification accuracies with the help of <b>equivalent</b> probabilities. <b>Department</b> of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
