40|$|With a {{world of}} {{increasing}} demands on our resources, renewable power supply is becoming an attractive alternative source of power especially in short distance travel. An easy way to save a little cash and increase in getting out more is to utilize solar power for transportation {{to and from work}} with little expense and a quick rate of return <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and effort. <b>This</b> design will show the promise of taking used bicycles and cutting them up along with some square tubing and miscellaneous electrical parts to create a recumbent trike that is electrically powered by 2 small electric motors, 2 batteries and recharged by the means of the sun; i. e. solar panel. It will be able to run at a speed of 8 - 10 miles an hour. The backyard ‘Do It Yourselfer’ will be able to build and join others in being ‘gas’ free and solar driven. It is hoped that the prototype model can withstand the demands of daily use and travel a minimum distance of 3 miles before recharging...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} stream {{crossings}} for pipelines {{appears to have}} been a rather controversial engineering topic in the gas and oil industry for some <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> is quite natural since pipelines are such a vital link in the transportation of the petroleums. A stream crossing on such a pipeline is always a potential source of trouble and many of the designs adopted have not proved to be as satisfactory as it was hoped they would be. Therefore, it is little wonder that there should be quite a divergence of opinions still in existence concerning best methods of design of these vital structures. The purpose of this paper is to present still another discussion of this subject <b>for</b> <b>your</b> consideration, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> from the viewpoint of an engineer outside of the industry. It is built up primarily from the basic concepts of mechanics and hydrodynamics together with what empirical information could be obtained upon the previous behaviour of various types of pipe line crossings...|$|R
