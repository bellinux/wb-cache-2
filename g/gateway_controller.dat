5000|$|H.248/Megaco {{exploded}} gatekeeper {{model of}} H.323 and put signaling control in a Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) thereby unbundling call intelligence from media. H.248 {{is meant to}} address {{the relationship between the}} Media Gateways (MGs), which converts circuit-switched voice to packet-based traffic, and the Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC). [...] Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) using H.248 instructs one or more Media Gateways (MG)s to connect streams coming from outside a packet or cell data network onto a packet or cell stream such as the Real-Time Transport Protocol.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the types}} of devices {{targeted}} for control by H.248/Megaco and the low level of its control structure, H.248 is generally viewed as complementary to H.323 and SIP. While a Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) will use H.248/Megaco to manage media establishment and control with a number of Media Gateways (MG), other VoIP protocol such as SIP and H.323 are used for one Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) to communicate with another Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC). From a SIP perspective, the combination of MGC and MGs are treated together as a SIP Gateway.|$|E

50|$|H.248/Megaco due to {{its master}} - slave nature does not {{describe}} the establishment of calls across domains or across Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controllers.</b> H.248/Megaco is used for communication downward, to the media gateways and does not constitute a complete system. The architecture requires a Peer-to-Peer for communication between Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controllers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{protocol}} is used between {{elements of}} a physically decomposed multimedia gateway, the media gateway and one or more media <b>gateway</b> <b>controllers,</b> and architecture that separates call control from media conversion between dissimilar networks. H.248/Megaco is a master/slave protocol used to separate the call control logic from the media processing logic in a gateway.|$|R
40|$|IxLoad Voice H. 248 / MEGACO {{provides}} the {{complete set of}} features to test H. 248 /MEGACO media gateways and media <b>gateways</b> <b>controllers.</b> It includes test functions to generate and terminate/validate MEGACO messages; media can be added by using the IxLoad Voice RTP module to exchange tones and voice media streaming. With the ability to combine Send / Receive MEGACO messages in any succession the test module can be easily used to simulate any call flow...|$|R
50|$|The H.248/Megaco model {{describes}} a connection model {{that contains the}} logical entities, or objects, within the Media Gateways (MGs) that can be controlled by the Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller.</b> The main entities are Contexts and Terminations.|$|E
5000|$|The H.248/Megaco model {{considerably}} simplifies {{connection setup}} within the MG and to entities outside the MG. It simplifies the {{mechanism by which}} the Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) can specify associated media streams as well as specify the direction of media flow. H.248/Megaco is therefore able to provide greater application level support than [...] Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). For example, setting up a multi-party conference using H.248/Megaco merely involves adding several terminations to a context. In case of [...] Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) however, the Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) needs to establish several connections to a special type of endpoint called the conference bridge.|$|E
50|$|Call Agents all of above {{features}} for all sites under the central controller. A central <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> includes both centralized configuration {{and maintenance of}} call control functionality. When new functionality needs to be added, only the controller needs to be updated.|$|E
5000|$|Communications network IC {{products}} manufactured {{and marketed}} by Realtek include: network interface controllers (both the traditional 10/100M Ethernet controllers {{and the more}} advanced gigabit Ethernet controllers), physical layer controllers (PHYceivers), network switch <b>controllers,</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>controllers,</b> wireless LAN ICs, as well as ADSL router controllers. In particular, the RTL8139 series 10/100M Fast Ethernet controllers reached their height during the late 1990s, and continued {{to take up a}} significant, and eventually predominant share in the worldwide market in the following years.|$|R
5000|$|Other companies, such as Symbol Technologies, SocketIP, and Digium, have {{implemented}} the protocol in VoIP terminals and IP phones, media <b>gateway</b> <b>controllers,</b> and softswitches. An open source implementation {{is available in}} the Asterisk and FreeSWITCH systems. IPBlue provides a soft phone that emulates a Cisco 7960 telephone. [...] Twinlights Software distributes a soft phone implementation for Android-based devices. The Cisco Unified Application Environment, the product acquired by Cisco when they purchased Metreos supports using SCCP to emulate Cisco 7960 phones allowing applications to access all Cisco line-side features.|$|R
5000|$|The Simple Gateway Control Protocol was {{published}} in 1998 by Christian Huitema and Mauricio Arango, {{as part of the}} development of the [...] "Call Agent Architecture" [...] at Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore). In this architecture a call-control elements, Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controllers</b> (MGCs) or the Call Agent, controls trunking, residential, and access-type VoIP [...] "media gateways" [...] and receives telephony signaling requests through a [...] "signalling gateway".Although these gateways target different market segments, all of them convert time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice to packet voice. Later implementation of the architecture refer to the [...] "Call Agent" [...] as a [...] "Softswitch".|$|R
5000|$|A media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> {{function}} (MGCF) is a SIP endpoint {{that does}} call control protocol conversion between SIP and ISUP/BICC and interfaces with the SGW over SCTP. It also controls the resources in a Media Gateway (MGW) across an H.248 interface.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (or IMS), the Softswitch element is {{represented}} by the Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) element, and the term [...] "Softswitch" [...] is rarely used in the IMS context. Rather, it is called an AGCF (Access Gateway Control Function).|$|E
50|$|Both H.248 and MGCP are {{protocol}} for controlling media gateways using a media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> or call agent. In a VoIP system, H.248 and MGCP are used with SIP or H.323. SIP or H.323 provide intercommunication between gateway controllers and MGCP {{is used to}} manage media establishment in the media gateways.|$|E
5000|$|Griffeth also {{researched}} the related {{problem of how}} to test networks to see how well they work together, called [...] "interoperability". She worked at the Next Generation Networking Lab at Lucent Technologies where she designed and built tools to test interoperability of Voice-over-IP networks, which included conformance testing for MeGaCo media <b>gateways</b> and <b>controllers.</b> For this purpose, she also researched how to model protocols.|$|R
50|$|Written in the Java {{programming}} language, LimeWire can run on any {{computer with}} a Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers were provided for Apple's Mac OS X, Microsoft's Windows, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other previous versions was dropped {{with the release of}} LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet <b>Gateway</b> Device <b>controller</b> in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.|$|R
50|$|MGCP was {{submitted}} to the IETFâ€™s MeGaCo working group in October 1998. In November 1998, Lucent Technologies submitted a draft for third device protocol, called Media Device Control Protocol (MDCP) to use by media <b>gateways</b> and their <b>controllers.</b> IETF merged MGCP and MDCP and proposed a new and improved protocol named MeGaCo protocol (also known as H.248) in April 1999.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} {{divides the}} functions {{required for the}} integration of traditional telecommunication networks and modern packet networks into several physical and logical components, notably the media gateway, the media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller,</b> and signaling gateways. The interaction between the media gateway and its controller is defined in the media gateway control protocol.|$|E
50|$|MGCP recognizes three {{essential}} elements of communication, the media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> (call agent), the media gateway endpoint, and connections between these entities. A media gateway may host multiple endpoints and each endpoint {{should be able to}} engage in multiple connections. Multiple connections on the endpoints support calling features such as call waiting and three-way calling.|$|E
50|$|One may {{quite often}} find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This was {{originally}} a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN, SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled {{one or more}} gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC).|$|E
5000|$|The gateway machine {{controls}} two {{network interface}} controllers, the [...] "external" [...] one {{being on a}} real 10.x.x.x network behind a router. A router that can perform network address translation on a single public IP address (can be static or dynamic in Gateway G2 systems) to a full 10.x.x.x/8 network is required. From there, the Gateway has another NIC connected directly to the D-STAR repeater controller via 10BaseT and the typical configuration is a 172.16.x.x (/24) pair of addresses between the <b>gateway</b> and the <b>controller.</b>|$|R
40|$|The buoy {{controller}} platform enables {{data acquisition}} from the connectable acoustic receiver, {{in addition to}} the other implemented log devices and connectable instruments. This allows the buoy platform to provide functionality beyond a specific application, thus enabling a wider range of use. The basic operation of the buoy controller platform consists of collecting data from its environment and instruments, and utilizing the data logging functionality for storing the data. In cases where several buoy controllers are deployed, they make use of the network capabilities of the radio module to enable a cooperative network. Through the network, each buoy controller will provide its data logs, which is collected by the buoy <b>controller</b> <b>gateway.</b> When equipping the <b>gateway</b> buoy <b>controller</b> with a separate communication module, remote access to the system is enabled, thus allowing data log download from the entirety of buoy controllers. The design provides power-friendly solutions, such as the possibility to control the power to all connected devices and instruments, and to define intervals for when to power them on, or off. The design also makes use of many of the integrated power saving features of the microcontroller. A great deal of functionality have been included {{in the design of the}} buoy controller platform. Most mentionable may be the time synchronization and positioning abilities using the on-board GPS module, network communication provided by the radio module, data logging capabilities by use of a SD-card, and remote connectivity through the implemented communication interface. In addition, a separate harvester module provides power consumption measurements and the ability to connect a solar panel for operation over longer periods of time...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Vehicle will be {{connected}} to the Internet as both for ubiquitous remote controlling and as a means to meet Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) needs. At first, a <b>gateway</b> system between <b>Controller</b> Area Network (CAN) and IPV 6 is required to connect vehicles to the Internet. Then this paper achieves the access of vehicle information and the control of vehicle using the CDMA wireless network based on the gateway. Finally, according to the result of the test, we have verified the correction and effectiveness of the control system...|$|R
50|$|Media {{gateways}} {{are often}} {{controlled by a}} separate Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> which provides the call control and signaling functionality. Communication between media gateways and Call Agents is achieved by means of protocols such as MGCP or Megaco (H.248) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Modern media gateways used with SIP are often stand-alone units with their own call and signaling control integrated and can function as independent, intelligent SIP end-points.|$|E
50|$|MGCP is a master/slave {{protocol}} {{that allows}} a call control device such as a Call Agent {{to take control of}} a specific port on a media gateway. In MGCP context media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> is referred to as call agent. This has the advantage of centralized gateway administration and provides for largely scalable IP Telephony solutions. The distributed system is composed of a call agent, at least one media gateway (MG) that performs the conversion of media signals between circuits and packets switched networks, and at least one signaling gateway (SG) when connected to the PSTN.|$|E
50|$|The {{device that}} handles the call control {{function}} {{is referred to}} as an intelligent Media <b>Gateway</b> <b>Controller</b> (MGC) and the device that handles the media {{is referred to as}} a relatively unintelligent Media Gateway (MG). H.248 defines the protocol for Media Gateway Controllers to control Media Gateways for the support of multimedia streams across IP networks and the Public Switched Telephone network (PSTN). It is typically used for providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services like voice and fax between IP networks and the PSTN), or entirely within IP networks.|$|E
30|$|The network central <b>controller</b> (<b>gateway)</b> device {{can make}} remote control to room air conditioners and other {{electrical}} equipment, {{it can also}} develop personalized scenario model and control strategies of intelligent editing room through the system to achieve the purpose of energy saving. In order to support data acquisition for different types of energy metering devices, it requires multiple communication protocols interface to achieve multi-energy metering (including single-phase energy meter, three-phase power meter, multi-function power meter), water meter, gas meter, features hot (cold) scale and other parameters at the same time. Data gateway should support multiple metering devices for data acquisition.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in wireless networking technologies are leading toward {{the proliferation of}} novel home network applications. However, the landscape of emerging scenarios is fragmented due to their varying technological requirements and the heterogeneity of current wireless technologies. We argue {{that the development of}} flexible software-defined wireless architectures, including such efforts as the wireless MAC processor, coupled with SDN concepts, will enable the support of both emerging and future home applications. In this article, we first identify problems with managing current home networks composed of separate network segments governed by different technologies. Second, we point out the flaws of current approaches to provide interoperability of these technologies. Third, we present a vision of a software-defined multi-technology network architecture (SDN@home) and demonstrate how a future home <b>gateway</b> (SDN <b>controller)</b> can directly and dynamically program network devices. Finally, we define a new type of flexibility enabled by SDN@home. Wireless protocols and features are no longer tied to specific technologies but can be used by general-purpose wireless SDN devices. This permits satisfaction of the requirements demanded by home owners and service providers under heterogeneous network conditions...|$|R
50|$|On November 17, 2016, the Z-Wave Alliance {{announced}} stronger {{security standards}} for devices receiving Z-Wave Certification as of April 2, 2017. Known as Security 2 (or S2), it provides advanced security for smart home devices, gateways and hubs. It shores up encryption standards for transmissions between nodes, and mandates new pairing procedures for each device, with unique PIN or QR codes on each device. The new layer of authentication {{is intended to}} prevent hackers from taking control of unsecured or poorly secured devices. According to the Z-Wave Alliance, the new security standard is the most advanced security available {{on the market for}} smart home devices and <b>controllers,</b> <b>gateways</b> and hubs.|$|R
50|$|A media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> (MGC), {{also known}} as a call agent, {{controls}} the media gateways. It monitors the gateways for events, such as an off-hook state when a user intends to initiate a telephone call, and issues requests to the gateway to initiate or complete sessions, to alert the called party, or to terminate a call. The protocols used for this interaction between the gateway and its controller have evolved through various types and versions. The Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) and the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) have been replaced by the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and Megaco, which is {{also known as}} H.248.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{gateways}} {{were viewed}} as monolithic devices that had call control, using protocols such as H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol, and hardware required to control the PSTN interface. In 1998, the idea of splitting the gateway into two logical parts was proposed: one part, which contains the call control logic, is called the media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> (MGC) or call agent (CA), and the other part, which interfaces with the PSTN, is called the media gateway (MG). With this functional split, a new interface existed between the MGC and the MG, requiring a framework for communication between the elements, resulting in the media gateway control protocol architecture.|$|E
50|$|A network {{implementing}} NCS {{is designed}} {{according to the}} media gateway control protocol architecture for interconnecting a packet network with the traditional {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). This architecture physically decomposes the functionality of providing complete end-to-end multimedia telecommunication sessions into several discrete components, notably a media gateway (MG) located at the customer premises that performs the physical translation between analog voice or video streams to packetized digital data, and a media <b>gateway</b> <b>controller</b> (MGC) which is a centralized server that controls typically many media gateways and manages the complexity of call setup, resource negotiation, call routing, and tear-down. In addition, the architecture also uses signaling gateways to the traditional telecommunication channels, such as SS7-based networks.|$|E
30|$|Five motor {{controllers}} {{are connected}} to a RoboNET network <b>controller</b> <b>gateway</b> unit (RGW-DV, IAI America Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) in the synthesis module, which is in turn controlled by the PLC. Two of these are pulse motor controllers (RPCON- 42 P, IAI America Inc.) that drive the x- and y-axes of the reagent and gas handling robot, a 350 - and 100 -mm-stroke two-axis linear servomotor (RCP 2 -SS 7 R-I- 42 P- 12 - 350 -P 1 - 007 L-ML-SP, RCP 3 -TA 7 R-I- 42 P- 6 - 100 -P 1 -N-ML, IAI America Inc.). The other three controllers are linear servomotor controllers (RACON- 5, IAI America Inc.) driving the linear servomotor (RCP 3 -SA 3 R-I- 28 P- 4 - 200 -P 1 -P-ML, IAI America Inc.) for the y-axis motion of each reactor.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors that ensure the quality and safety of construction. According to the characteristics of construction site environment, an automatic multi-channel real-time monitoring system of construction site environment temperature is developed based on virtual instrument technology. Combined with ZigBee wireless transmission technology, this system can realize remote real-time temperature monitoring for construction site. The system hardware consists of main <b>controller,</b> <b>gateway,</b> wireless sensor nodes and thermocouple temperature sensors. The temperature information is collected by thermocouples.

40|$|Currently {{the smart}} home system is mainly {{used in a}} number of upscale {{communities}} and has not been widely used for ordinary people. As we all know, the smart home controller integrally stores a large number of audio, video, image information. It requires a high-speed and realtime network which can make it possible to let mobile phones become a control terminal. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to improve the performance of the control network in current smart home system, and to design the controller module which is used ARM server as our home controller processor. The autonomous control and reconstruction can be realized both by home <b>controller</b> <b>gateway</b> and wireless network nodes, the most basic and important unit, which is the ZigBee wireless network module in those home appliances.
