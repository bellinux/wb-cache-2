With the reign of Möngke-Temür, a jarlig was issued to Metropolitan Kirill for the Orthodox Church in 1267. While the church had been under the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection</b> of the Mongols ten years earlier (from the 1257 census conducted under Khan Berke), this jarlig formally decreed protection for the Orthodox Church. More importantly, it officially exempted the church from any form of taxation by Mongol or Russian authorities and permitted clergymen to remain unregistered during censuses and clergy were furthermore not liable for forced labor or military service. For the first time, the Orthodox church would become less dependent on princely powers than in any other period of Russian history.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{question}} of whether constitutional rights matter is of great theoretical and practical importance, we know little about whether any constitutional rights actually improve rights in practice. We test the effectiveness of six political rights. We hypothesize that “organizational” rights increase <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> rights <b>protection,</b> because they create organizations with the incentives and means to protect the underlying right. By contrast, individual rights are unlikely to make a difference. To test our theory, we use a recently developed identification strategy that mitigates selection bias by incorporating previously unobserved information on countries’ preferences for constitutional rights into the research design. Specifically, we use data on constitutional rights adoption since 1946 to calculate countries’ yearly constitutional ideal point, and then match on the probability that a country will protect a specific right in its constitution. Our results suggest that only organizational rights are associated with increased <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> rights <b>protection...</b>|$|R

40|$|The years 2011 and 2012 {{were among}} the most deadly for journalists {{reporting}} from conflict situations worldwide. The numbers of assaults, arrests and attacks have been on a constant rise and portray a dramatic image of the journalistic profession. In light of the increasing threats in armed conflicts, being a war reporter has become an inherently dangerous task. Journalists are not only at risk of becoming so-called collateral damage during military operations, they are also increasingly targeted. Their role as a watchdog and witness to the horrors of war, in addition to the undeniable power of the word and image they spread, has made them popular targets. It is therefore essential that the international community re-evaluate journalists' de jure and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protections</b> in armed conflicts to allow for better safeguards and consequently less casualties in the imminent future. This article examines the current protections afforded to journalists and aims at detecting proposals for enhanced safeguards that are most likely to effectively improve journalists' safety in the field. In this regard, this article will argue that the legal protections are in fact sufficient and hardly amendable and that therefore, a more practical, hands-on approach to implementation of those protections must be the focus of future actions. This goal can only be achieved by a comprehensive mission jointly pursued by governments, militaries, journalists, media, NGOs and society. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although similar formal {{regulations}} to protect property rights have proliferated across {{many parts of}} the world, the adherence to these norms is not consistent across countries. As a result, countries with seemingly similar formal regulations pose very different hazards for investors. Departing from traditional studies that have focused on the formal regulations of host countries in explaining Multinational Corporations ’ (MNCs) perceptions of hazards and hence strategic actions, this paper argues that firms ’ location choices are influenced not just by de jure norms but also by their expectation of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection.</b> In addition, I examine the moderating effect of a firm’s international operations in mitigating this expected hazard. Using a panel of 161 firms from 16 home countries and their foreign investments in up to 66 host countries in the information services offshoring sector from 2002 - 2005 and novel measures, the empirical results show that MNC location choices are impacted by the estimated <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection</b> of a host country.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{relationship}} between ownership structure and firm performance, including judicial system efficiency as a moderator to investigate the joint effects of both explanatory variables. Although prior studies have considered judicial system efficiency by examining de jure investor protection, this study identifies another useful proxy and explores <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> legal <b>protection.</b> Design/methodology/approach Ordinary Least Square multiple regression models were used to examine the influence of judicial efficiency, which was measured using the Disposition Time (DT) and Legal Origin, as a moderator of the relationship between ownership concentration and firm performance for a sample of 565 non-financial companies listed in Italy, France, Germany and Spain in 2013. Findings This paper shows that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> investor <b>protection</b> ensured by an efficient judicial system is relevant to the relationship between firm performance and ownership structure. As a moderator variable, DT strengthens the intensity of this relationship in countries with low judicial efficiency, showing that ownership concentration leads to a better enhancement of firm performance and is therefore a more efficient governance mechanism in countries in which investor protection is weak. Originality/value The evidence presented expands our understanding of the link between firm performance and ownership structure. The institutional deficiencies suggest that internal governance mechanisms may substitute for external mechanisms in facilitating efficient governance. This study corroborates policymakers’ concerns regarding the efficiency of judicial systems and their role in protecting the rights of minority shareholders. The results suggest a need for more efficient external mechanisms of investor protection to facilitate investment in equity capital. Moreover, this study shows that DT is a more accurate measure of investor protection than the traditional measure of de jure legal protection...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} pointed out: First, the fact that users of the law enjoy <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> higher <b>protection</b> against {{dismissals}} has raised some debate about the potential inflexibility regarding any future dismissals that firms face when hiring potential law users. 11 Second, this protection against dismissal essentially applies only to workers under indefinite contracts. The law says nothing with respect to any obligation to renew fixed-term contracts. 12 In principle, target workers with fixed-term contracts are also granted {{the right to use}} the policy and hence reduce their working hours. However, given that the situation with regard to job protection differs so much from one type of contract to another, we look at the potential impacts of the law for each type of contract separately here. Finally, as mentioned above, the policy was aimed at helping to reconcile work and family life for families with children under 6. However, we focus only on the potential impact on mothers, given that preliminary evidence indicates that the proportion of fathers who resorted to part-time work {{both before and after the}} passing of the law is consistently lower than 1  %.|$|R
50|$|These Sephardic Jews, who {{initially}} {{pretended to be}} persecuted Catholics, first came to Hamburg {{at the end of}} the 16th century. They were mostly Portuguese- or Spanish-speaking merchants. In 1621, when the armistice between Spain and the Netherlands came to an end, many of the Portuguese Jews moved to Hamburg. They were made welcome, even after the actual situation had become clear; however they were not permitted to establish a cemetery within the city walls. Thanks to the linguistic skills of the Sephardim and their contacts among their co-religionaries they controlled a large sector of the German market in provisions. The Sephardim differed culturally and socially from the Jews who came to Altona, and subsequently also to Hamburg, from the east. These were Yiddish Language speaking Ashkenazim.The permanent settlement of the Ashkenazim was opposed by both the Senate of Hamburg (town council) and the citizens, supported by the Sephardim, who did not wish to see the establishment of a second community in Hamburg.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of natural resources}} {{has become a major}} issue {{in many parts of the}} world, with the most accessible resources being most at risk. In the terrestrial realm, resource depletion has classically been related to accessibility through road networks. In contrast, in the marine realm, the impact on living resources is often framed into the Malthusian theory of human density around ecosystems. Here, we develop a new framework to estimate the accessibility of global coral reefs using potential travel time from the nearest human settlement or market. We show that 58 % of coral reefs are located < 30 min from the nearest human settlement. We use a case study from New Caledonia to demonstrate that travel time from the market is a strong predictor of fish biomass on coral reefs. We also highlight a relative deficit of protection on coral reef areas near people, with disproportional protection on reefs far from people. This suggests that conservation efforts are targeting low-conflict reefs or places that may already be receiving <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection</b> due to their isolation. Our global assessment of accessibility in the marine realm is a critical step to better understand the interplay between humans and resources...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the legal (de jure) and normative (<b>de</b> <b>facto)</b> <b>protection</b> for academic {{freedom in the}} UK, {{when compared with the}} other 27 EU nations. The legal protection is assessed first, by examining the EU nations’ constitutions and legislative instruments; second, by means of an assessment of individual nations’ degree of compliance with UNESCO’s 1997 Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel; and third by means of a very detailed analysis of 37 differing elements of university compliance with an array of measures, such as international instruments, but also including (for example) the ability of academic staff to appoint or dismiss the Rector, Deans and Heads of Departments. In sharp contrast with the other 27 EU nations, the constitutional protection for academic freedom (either directly, or indirectly via freedom of speech) in the UK is negligible, as is the legislative protection for the substantive (teaching and learning) and supportive (tenure and governance) elements of academic freedom. Additionally, the UK is similarly deficit in protecting academic freedom in line with international agreements of which it is a signatory, more especially UNESCO’s 1997 Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel.

40|$|This analysis, {{which uses}} similar surveys to gather {{comparable}} data from over 2000 UCU members and 5000 staff in universities of the European states, {{demonstrates that the}} low level of de jure protection for academic freedom in the UK is mirrored by an equally poor (if not worse) level of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection.</b> The reality is that, in the overwhelming majority of instances, UCU members report statistically significantly higher levels of systematic abuse of their academic freedom, across a wide array of measures, than their European counterparts. For example, 23 % of UCU respondents (and 14. 1 % of EU respondents) reported being bullied on account of their academic views, 26. 6 % of UCU respondents reported being subjected to psychological pressure (EU = 15. 7 %), while 35. 5 % of the UCU cohort admitted to self-censorship, for fear of negative repercussions, such as loss of privileges, demotion, physical harm (EU= 19. 1 %). Some of this abuse may be attributable to a lack of knowledge of academic freedom rights among staff – only 41. 7 % of the UCU cohort claimed to have an adequate working knowledge of academic freedom (EU= 49. 2), while less than half that proportion (20. 6 %) knew about the 1988 Education Reform Act, which supposedly protects academic freedom in the UK. Not surprisingly, 81. 6 % of UCU respondents said they would welcome additional information on the concept of academic freedom and its rights and responsibilities. Furthermore, UCU members {{are much more likely to}} strongly agree than their European counterparts that the major elements of academic freedom (freedom for teaching and research, autonomy, shared governance and employment protection) have declined. Work elsewhere suggests two possible options to ameliorate this situation. First, awareness raising about academic freedom among UCU members, along with the provision of explanatory information and training materials. Second, an appeal to UNESCO that the UK government does not meet its obligations under the 1997 Recommendation (of which it is a signatory state). The stark differences between the UK and the EU, in terms of de jure protection and de facto realities, both demonstrate the necessity for such an approach and provide a highly credible basis for such an appeal. This strategy was successfully adopted by the Dansk Magisterforening, the Danish academic professional association, and led to an independent expert evaluation of the legal protection for academic freedom, and change in the law...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} adoption {{and development of}} effective property rights regimes in the global system of countries {{and the influence of}} these regimes on multinational corporations 2 ̆ 7 (MNCs) investment choices. I argue that formal property rights regimes and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> practices adopted by a country are influenced by those of other countries within the global system even in the presence of decoupling (i. e. the divergence of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> practices from <b>de</b> jure policies). Further, location choices of MNCs are influenced by the development of effective property rights regimes in host countries while firm level characteristics alter their sensitivity to these regimes. I present evidence from three related empirical studies. Chapter 2 establishes the interdependent nature of policy adoption in a dyadic context by observing the signing of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). Domestic factors as well as international diffusion pressures of competition and emulation explain patterns of BIT signing while their relative impacts shift between early periods of policy innovation and later periods of policy institutionalization. Chapter 3 confirms the persistence of global diffusion pressures after adoption through an examination of Intellectual Property protection in countries around the world. <b>De</b> <b>facto</b> practices of a country are also influenced by the practices of other countries in the global system. In addition, the international pressures influencing policy adoption have a lasting effect and alter subsequent behavior of domestic constituents. Chapter 4 studies the location choices of MNCs in the information services industry to establish the dependence of firms 2 ̆ 7 location choices on the development of a host country 2 ̆ 7 s property rights regimes. Observed patterns of MNC location choices may be explained by the current and expected future <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> property rights <b>protection.</b> This relationship is moderated by the extent of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s international operations as it provides an alternate mechanism for protecting their assets. Together, the results provide evidence of the globally interdependent nature of the adoption and development of property rights regimes and the importance of these regimes in explaining MNC investment choices. ...|$|R

40|$|Prince Edward Island, Salmon Fishing Area 17, {{is part of}} the {{southern}} Gulf - Gaspé Designatable Unit which COSEWIC assessed as Special Concern in 2010. Atlantic salmon probably occupied about 71 PEI rivers at the time of European contact. Rivers containing salmon fell to 28 in 2000 - 2002 and to 22 in 2007 - 2008, with salmon presence detected in one additional river in 2011. Original salmon populations were largely late-run and multi-sea-winter, but stocking fish of mainland origin has led to early run components in seven PEI rivers. Reported harvest in aboriginal Food, Social, and Ceremonial fisheries were 0 - 1 fish per year in 2009 - 2011 (only one of two licenced groups provided harvest information in 2011). Recreational salmon angling is permitted in all PEI rivers, but salmon in small rivers receive <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection</b> from angling because seasons close on 15 September, before fish return to these rivers. Salmon fishing is permitted up to 31 October in parts of larger rivers which have early-run components. Recreational angling has been catch-and-release since 2009. Estimated mortalities in the angling fishery due to catch-and-release mortality (assumed to be 3 %) were 1 - 4 fish per year in 2009 - 2011. Angler card surveys indicate that fishing effort, small salmon kept, and small and large salmon released have followed declining trends since the mid- 1990 s. Total conservation requirements for current salmon rivers (4, 668, 586 eggs) are based on all habitat types in these rivers, including habitat blocked by dams. Egg deposition was estimated from historic biological characteristics and redd counts, using a redd:female spawner ratio (3. 357) measured in a single year in the West River, PEI. Total estimated egg deposition in current salmon rivers is 67. 7 % of requirements for these rivers. Estimated deposition exceeds requirements in six rivers. Total conservation requirements for all 71 probable current and historic salmon rivers on PEI are 10, 565, 273 eggs. Estimated total egg deposition is 29. 9 % of this total. Atlantic salmon on PEI are negatively affected by sedimentation, blockages to upstream passage due to artificial and beaver dams, excessive water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels caused by some dams, pesticide inputs, and competition with rainbow trout. Fishing mortality from aboriginal fishery harvests and from angling is currently low and probably has little impact on salmon populations. Major sources of uncertainty in this assessment include low sample sizes in angler card surveys, use of historic rather than current data on biological characteristics, and use of a redd:spawner ratio measured at only one site in one yea...|$|E

Local communities may have de jure rights to forest resources, but <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>protection</b> is often weak. This study focuses on 25 -year community concessions in the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) in Guatemala and indigenous territories in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN), Nicaragua. In both cases, communities are struggling to enforce their rights as powerful external groups seek to expand cattle ranching, cash crops, tourism, and oil exploration. We found evidence that community forestry can generate significant socio-economic benefits that, along with contributions to forest conservation, substantiate the communities’ claim for strengthened and extended community forest stewardship. We selected six community forest enterprises (CFEs) along a business development gradient and assessed their context, economic viability, and livelihood benefits among randomly selected CFE members (n= 180). Adopting an asset lens, we determined human, social, natural, physical and financial capital endowments at household and enterprise levels. Enterprise assets varied widely, both within and across countries. CFEs were well endowed with natural capital (7, 000 – 54, 000 ha of broadleaf forests) but highly dependent on precious woods, such as mahogany (Swietenia macropylla) or andiroba (Carapa guianensis). Human capital was sufficiently developed for managing forests, but less so for processing wood and doing business. Social capital has been built in Guatemala through internal organisation, bringing CFEs {{under the umbrella of}} a regional association, and developing relationships with buyers. In Nicaragua, however, building of social capital has been insufficient for inducing a self-sustaining process of CFE development. Physical capital for logging and wood processing was moderate but, in Guatemala, conditions facilitate significant value adding. CFEs there were profitable, while those in the RACCN struggled to break even. Household assets varied widely but, in the MBR, we found evidence that forest-based income can lift people out of poverty. Our analyses reveal that critical success factors for community forestry to reduce poverty, conserve forests and enhance equity are: secure long-term forest usufruct rights or ownership, efficient business organisation, credible advocacy, a conducive service environment, and differentiated opportunities for women, men and youth...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{immigration}} and {{the so called}} new social risks are undoubtedly strongly linked, this nexus has been poorly investigated in academic literature both on welfare state and on migration. The goal {{of this paper is}} to bridge this gap by disclosing the social inequalities -and therefore the specific social risks- experienced by immigrants in Europe and particularly in Italy. In this respect, working poverty, labour market segregation in low qualified jobs, migrant women’s conciliation needs and, in general, the difficult social mobility of second generations come to the fore. In order to find out to what extent public policies take into account the social risks encountered by immigrants, the paper analyses the regional integration policies in eight Italian regions, since they are central actors in the definition of the social policies aimed at dealing with immigrant social vulnerability. The research points out that the social risks associated to the migrant background are poorly recognized and however addressed with an old policy approach, i. e. with measures that on the overall reproduce existing gaps into the Italian welfare system, such as lack of attention for women’s conciliation needs and for young generations weak status in the labour market.

40|$|The Supreme Court has {{interpreted}} the Equal Protection Clause as a formal equality mandate. In response, legal scholars have advocated alternative conceptions of equality, such as antisubordination theory, that interpret equal protection in more substantive terms. Antisubordination theory would consider {{the social context}} in which race-based policies emerge and recognize material distinctions between policies intended to oppress racial minorities and those designed to ameliorate past and current racism. Antisubordination theory would also closely scrutinize facially neutral state action that systemically disadvantages vulnerable social groups. The Court has largely ignored these reform proposals. Modern Supreme Court rulings, however, have invoked the concept of dignity in order to redress discrimination against disadvantaged classes. Other opinions make appeals to dignity {{in order to protect}} or recognize fundamental rights or liberties for marginalized groups.

Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R

This is done by considering the nexus between de jure (by law) statelessness and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> citizenship. The argument that if someone can have citizenship that is so ineffective they are <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> stateless is extended to consider if a person can receive such effective 'citizenship', despite de jure statelessness, {{that they should be}} considered a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> citizen, thus not stateless. By drawing upon the example of the stateless Estonians of Russian origin, the dangers of not recognising the centrality of the legal bond of citizenship, seen in attempts to incorporate <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statelessness into the statelessness debate, are reflected upon. <b>De</b> <b>facto</b> 'statelessness' is shown not only to underutilise the plethora of human rights conventions available, but also to threaten the statelessness conventions themselves...|$|R
