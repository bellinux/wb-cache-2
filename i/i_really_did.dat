500|$|Bowie's love {{of acting}} led his total {{immersion}} in the characters he created for his music. [...] "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." [...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> have doubts about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E
500|$|... "Back Up, Dancer" [...] {{was written}} by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2004. It was confirmed in mid-2004 that singer Janet Jackson would guest star as herself on the television series Will & Grace. She recorded her lines {{in front of a}} live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime-time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a [...] "big fan" [...] of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. [...] "I thought he studied dance. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did,</b> It's so funny. I have to catch myself because I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [...]" [...] Jackson [...] "had a tough time" [...] on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be. [...] "I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated when I made those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising." [...] Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the [...] "easy part of playing myself".|$|E

Because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not spy, it is terrible that I cannot defend myself". The most terrible and heart-breaking moment for Mata Hari during the trial occurred when her lover Maslov – by now a deeply embittered man {{as a result of}} losing his eyes in combat – declined to testify for her, telling her he couldn't care less if she were convicted or not. It was reported that Zelle fainted when she learned that Maslov had abandoned her.|$|E

2500|$|The {{new series}} is a {{continuation}} of the old series, with the story continuing after a 20-year break. It does not take the events of the 1990s TV movies [...] or [...] as canon. Instead we find the characters 20 years after the events of the Season 14 cliffhanger. In an interview with UltimateDallas.com, writer/producer Cynthia Cidre was asked to describe the new Dallas. She responded, [...] "I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [...] Trekkies, really committed to that show and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not understand that before, so I never wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past. On the other hand that was the past, twenty years had gone by, so at the same time I think we're properly balanced between the characters of Bobby Ewing, J.R. and Sue Ellen. I also have the new cast and it's John Ross and Christopher, the children of Bobby and J.R., and their love interests. Total respect and a balance of old and new." ...|$|E
2500|$|Four days later, on 13March, a Jordanian soldier {{patrolling the}} borders between Jordan and Israel {{in the north}} near the Island of Peace, shot seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded six others. The King, who was on an {{official}} visit to Spain, returned home immediately. He personally travelled to the Israeli town of Beit Shemesh to offer his condolences {{to the families of}} the Israeli children killed. He went on his knees in front of the families. His gesture was received very warmly in Israel, and Hussein sent the families $1million in total as compensation for the loss of life. The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to 20years in prison, which he served entirely. Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced. Hussein's wife then, Queen Nour, later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping: [...] "Everything he had worked for all his life, every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect, every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan's children, was turning into a nightmare. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not know how much more Hussein could take." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought you did a really phenomenal job, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, Bourguiba {{developed}} a great consideration for mathematics {{because of the}} attention that dedicated his new teacher, Mr. Perrachon to his students. However, he was never present during French lessons, taught by an old regularly heckled professor: [...] "Our timetable scheduled, for Friday afternoon, a history-geography lesson, from 2pm to 3pm and a french lesson from 3pm to 4pm. I was present during the first lesson then left high school at 3pm {{in order to go}} to the theatre where an Arab play was held, in Friday afternoon [...] I was very keen on drama. I thought, moreover, that in matters of French, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not need to provide additional efforts, being taught by Mr. Collières at Sadiki". Indeed, he was ranked first in quarterly exams of French, despite these repeated absences. The reason was mere according to Bourguiba who explained it: [...] "Every Friday afternoon, a supervisor came to our history class at 2p.m. He checked the presents and wrote the names of those who were absent. Thus supervisor, who by the way was Tunisian, came back the next hour in french classes. The professor, whose dignity forbade him to suffer a native heckling, hastened to mention the same names written on the notebook and sign. Thus, I had never attended French classes and my absences were regularly unnoticed". Nevertheless, during quarterly exams, Bourguiba was ranked first of second in French.|$|E

She helped the British team qualify in fifth place and individually she qualified to the all around final with a score of 56.391. [...] Tunney said, [...] "I went out thinking I should just enjoy my first Olympics and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> It was {{the most amazing thing}} I've ever done in my life. It was tense but the crowd were so supportive." [...] In the team final, Tunney contributed scores of 14.866 on vault and 14.766 on uneven bars toward the British team's sixth-place finish. [...] She said, [...] "First Olympic Games and we're getting into the team final and finishing sixth, you can't ask for anything bigger. It was inspiring to see the men get a medal. They did their best yesterday and so did we, even though we didn't medal." [...] In the all around final, Tunney placed thirteenth with a score of 56.932. [...] She said, [...] "It's been an amazing experience here in London; the best week of my life. To compete at a home Games in front of this crowd has been incredible. To be the youngest in Team GB I'm very proud and I've learnt so much. The rest of the Games I'm looking forward to the atmosphere and cheering on Team GB." ...|$|E
