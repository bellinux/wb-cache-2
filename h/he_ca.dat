50|$|Casey sees Chris and Ali {{getting closer}} and starts a fling with Vienna Hyatt. She is merely using {{him to get}} {{pregnant}} and trick Henry Coleman to marry her once she sees {{that he is in}} love with Barbara Ryan. After they almost get caught by Henry in Vienna's room, Casey finds a bag full of pregnancy tests and suspect that she is pregnant with his child. When he keeps asking her if she is pregnant and not getting a straight answer he decides to investigate himself. After <b>he</b> <b>ca</b> not find the doctor's name in the hospital records, he asks Alison to help him with his situation. She accepts but it is clear she is pained at the fact that Vienna may be pregnant with his child. After much research they discover that Vienna is indeed pregnant but the baby cannot be Casey's because from her medical records, she was already with child when Casey had sex with her. Casey thanks Alison for her help and they start to get closer again. They find out that Vienna never was pregnant and that her medical records were falsified by Katie to help her in her plan to trap Henry. Will and Gwen returns to try to search a missing Barbara and during a barbecue Casey and Will discuss parenthood and marriage, while Gwen and Allison discuss the same thing in a separate room. They both realize that they are still in love with each other and want to try it again. Casey proposes to Allison again and she accepts. She wants to run away to get married in Las Vegas but Casey wants to give her the wedding she deserves. Nancy dies before {{they have a chance to}} announce their engagement. But when Chris is in the hospital cause of his heart condition, Kim notices Ali wearing Nancy's wedding ring and their engagement is made public. They agree to marry and move to Carbondale with Gwen and Will, where Casey will practice law.|$|E
40|$|The grapho-linguistic {{approach}} to teaching reading involves the labeling of self-initiated graphic images reinforced by the copying of the written labels, which helps the child to understand the transference of meaning from the object to its name to its written name. The best time to start labeling strategies is when the child draws recognizable images and demonstrates horizontality. A child who is actively trying to learn the signs attached to objects is demonstrating that he has discovered the symbolic function cf the written word. After proving successful in Washington, D. C., the grapho-linguistic {{approach to}} teaching reading now appears to hold the greatest promise for laying a good reading foundation based on the following factors: (1) drawing comes as naturally to a child as walking, talking, and playing; (2) the child invests his drawings with meaning; (3) the child who is helped to realize that <b>he</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of relationships among impulsiveness, locus of control, sex, observed practice behaviors, practice effectiveness, and self-reported practice habits {{in a sample of}} 40 college brass players. Practice effectiveness was defined by the amount of change in pretest and posttest performance achievement scores over one 23 -minute practice session. Each subject’s practice session was analyzed for frequency of practice behaviors. Measures included the Eysenck Impulsiveness Questionnaire for Adults (1985), the Nowicki-Duke Locus of Control Scale for Adults (1974), and a researcher-designed practice questionnaire. Results indicated (a) a significant inter-action effect (p . 05) in impulsiveness, locus of con-trol, or performance achievement by sex; (d) significant relationships (p . 05) between amount of time spent playing during the practice session in the study and performance achievement. The author would like to thank Dr. Charles P. Schmidt of Indiana University in Bloomington for his advice and guidance throughout the develpment of this project.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} spectroscopic analysis of 61 low mass white dwarfs and provide precise atmospheric parameters, masses, and updated binary system parameters {{based on our}} new model atmosphere grids {{and the most recent}} evolutionary model calculations. For the first time, we measure systematic abundances of <b>He,</b> <b>Ca</b> and Mg for metal-rich extremely low mass white dwarfs and examine the distribution of these abundances as a function of effective temperature and mass. Based on our preliminary results, we discuss the possibility that shell flashes may be responsible for the presence of the observed He and metals. We compare stellar radii derived from our spectroscopic analysis to model-independent measurements and find good agreement except for those white dwarfs with Teff < 10, 000 K. We also calculate the expected gravitational wave strain for each system and discuss their significance to the eLISA space-borne gravitational wave observatory. Finally, we provide an update on the instability strip of extremely low mass white dwarf pulsators. Comment: 18 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

40|$|We present {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations of}} the interacting transient SN 2009 ip taken during the 2013 and 2014 observing seasons. We characterise the photometric evolution as a steady and smooth decline in all bands, with a decline rate that is slower than expected for a solely ^ 56 Co-powered supernova at late phases. No further outbursts or eruptions were seen over a two year period from 2012 December until 2014 December. SN 2009 ip remains brighter than its historic minimum from pre-discovery images. Spectroscopically, SN 2009 ip continues {{to be dominated by}} strong, narrow (≲ 2000 km s^- 1) emission lines of H, <b>He,</b> <b>Ca,</b> and Fe. While we make tenuous detections of [Fe ii] λ 7155 and [O i] λλ 6300, 6364 lines at the end of 2013 June and the start of 2013 October respectively, we see no strong broad nebular emission lines that could point to a core-collapse origin. In general, the lines appear relatively symmetric, with the exception of our final spectrum in 2014 May, when we observe the appearance of a redshifted shoulder of emission at + 550 km s^- 1. The lines are not blue-shifted, and we see no significant near- or mid-infrared excess. From the spectroscopic and photometric evolution of SN 2009 ip until 820 days after the start of the 2012 a event, we still see no conclusive evidence for core-collapse, although whether any such signs could be masked by ongoing interaction is unclear.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a third white dwarf hosting a gaseous debris disc, SDSS J 084539. 17 + 225728. 0. The typical double-peaked Ca II 8498, 8542, 8662 ˚A emission lines can be modelled in terms of a Keplerian gas disc with a radial extent from ∼ 0. 5 R ⊙ to ∼ 1. 0 R⊙. The effective temperature of SDSS 0845 + 2257, Teff ≃ 18600 ± 500 K, is comparable to the two other white dwarfs with gaseous discs, SDSS 1043 + 0855 and SDSS 1228 + 1040, and hence substantially hotter than the bulk of white dwarfs where dusty debris discs were identified through the presence of infrared excess flux. This may suggest that the conditions to produce emission lines from debris discs in the optical wavelength range are only met for a relatively narrow range in Teff. The observed asymmetry in the line profiles indicates a substantial eccentricity in the disc. Two spectra obtained four years apart reveal a significant change in the shapes and equivalent widths of the line profiles, implying that the circumstellar disc evolves on relatively short time scales. In contrast to SDSS 1043 + 0855 and SDSS 1228 + 1040, SDSS 0845 + 2257 has a helium-dominated atmosphere. We detect photospheric absorption lines of <b>He,</b> <b>Ca,</b> Mg, and Si in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum, and hence classify SDSS 0845 + 2257 as DBZ white dwarf. The abundances for the three metals determined from model atmosphere fits are Ca/He ≃ 1. 3 × 10 − 7, Mg/He ≃ 6. 0 × 10 − 6, and Si/He ≃ 8. 0 × 10 − 6. From the non-detection of Hα we derive H/He < 3 × 10 − 5, which implies that the hydrogen-to-metal abundance ratio of the circumstellar material is � 1000 times lower than in the Sun. This lends strong support to the hypothesis that the gaseous and dusty debris discs found around roughly a dozen white dwarfs originate from the disruption of rocky planetary material...|$|E
