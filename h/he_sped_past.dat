60|$|Then {{he heard}} a shout and saw a farmer trying to move a loaded cart out of his way. He had not noticed that he was riding furiously down a hill, but <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> the cart upon the grassy margin {{of the road and}} laughed as he went on. His mood had changed and he {{resolved}} that he would go back to the creeper-covered house when Helen had had time to recover and his society would be less disturbing. After all, Mrs. Dalton had told him he might come.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} when he awoke, and {{perhaps he was}} feverish or his brain was {{weakened}} by illness, for it reproduced past scenes that were mysteriously connected with the present. He was in a strange house in Santa Brigida, for he remarked the shadowy creeper {{on the wall and}} a pool of moonlight on the dark floor of his room. Yet the cornfields in an English valley, through which he drove his motor bicycle, seemed more real, and he could see the rows of stocked sheaves stretch back from the hedgerows <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> <b>past.</b> Something sinister and threatening awaited him {{at the end of the}} journey, but he could not tell what it was. Then the cornfields vanished and he was crossing a quiet, walled garden with a girl at his side. He remembered how the moonlight shone through the branches of a tree and fell in silver, splashes on her white dress. Her face was in the shadow, but he knew it well.|$|E
60|$|Roused by {{the story}} told by the affrighted ones who had rushed so unceremoniously into their presence, {{as well as by}} the startling cry of 'Run, black devil! catch white devil!' which the idiot had shouted as <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> the door, several of the topers emerged from their abiding place; and as nothing could be seen of either mock ghost, spectre, or idiot, they bravely {{determined}} to go in search of them. As they passed along the road from the village, their attention was attracted by the cries which seemed to come from the lonely lane, and somewhat nervously making their way along it, they soon saw the idiot dancing about the side of the ditch. With a sudden access of courage, due to the presence of anything human, however weak, they hurried along, and as they drew nearer, the idiot paused in his gambols, and pointed to the mock ghost, who lay stretched in the shadow of the hedgerow. He was soon carried away to the village, where he lay ill for weeks.|$|E
60|$|He {{no doubt}} {{thought of his}} friend's {{forecast}} as he travelled along the highway in his chariot; but the sculptural repose of his profile against the vanishing daylight on his right hand would have shown his friend that the Earl's equanimity was undisturbed. He reached the solitary wayside tavern called Lornton Inn--the rendezvous of many a daring poacher for operations in the adjoining forest; and he might have observed, if {{he had taken the}} trouble, a strange post-chaise standing in the halting-space before the inn. <b>He</b> duly <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> it, and half-an-hour after through the little town of Warborne. Onward, a mile farther, was the house of his entertainer.|$|R
60|$|The {{youngest}} Rover {{opened the}} door, {{and like a}} flash Dick and Tom <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> him and into the room. Dora and Nellie rushed to meet them, laughing and crying hysterically.|$|R

50|$|Finch was re-selected for {{the next}} Welsh international, this time against the touring New Zealand team. Wales were {{completely}} outclassed and lost the game 19-0, and Finch would face the All Blacks just four days later as his Llanelli team played host to the tourists. The New Zealanders faced far stiffer opposition as Llanelli went on the offensive. The forwards tackled with ferocity and Llanelli may have won with better kicking accuracy. In the match, Finch scored Llanelli's only points with a memorable solo try. Finch took a quick line-out, took the returning ball and left Hart flat-footed as <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> him. With the try line in sight the only All Black defender was George Nepia. As Nepia closed in, Finch stopped dead, Nepia paused and then threw a tackle which Finch dodged, leaving him a clear try line to score over.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 May 1916, Townshend {{was taken}} in an Ottoman motor boat up the Tigris to Baghdad and was run past by his men, who cheered him as he saluted in return. Despite the whips of the guards who tried to keep their charges marching down the road, the POWs rushed to {{the bank of the}} Tigris to cheer their general on as <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> them, {{shouting}} [...] "Three cheers for our brave general! Hip-hip-hurrah!". It was the last time that most of Townshend's men were to see him. The Ottomans provided their POWs with a few hardened biscuits for food. Braddon wrote that after eating the biscuits: [...] "The following morning, they began to die. Frothing at the mouth, their bowels and stomachs disintegrating into a greenish slime, dehydrated and moaning, they died one after the other". The illness that afflicted the British and Indian POWs was enteritis that was contained within the biscuits. After the surrender, the Ottomans forced the British and Indian POWs to embark upon a brutal [...] "death march" [...] to POW camps in Anatolia, during which the prisoners were forced to march under the scorching hot sun while being deprived of water, food and medical care while constantly being whipped by the Kurdish and Arab tribesmen the Ottoman state had hired to guard them; those who faltered on the [...] "death march" [...] were shot on the spot. In the evening, the men on the death march were given biscuits to eat and water to drink. The only reason why the guards kept their charges alive was to rape them and {{during the course of the}} death march all of the POWs were repeatedly gang-raped. McKnight stated in an interview that: [...] "Once they arrived in the prisoner-of-war camps, conditions were little better and hundreds died every month from starvation or being beaten to death by the odd casually brutal Turkish guard". The Indian Muslims serving as support troops at Kut were the only POWs (other than the officers) who were well-treated by the Ottomans and many promptly joined the Ottoman Army to fight against the British. When the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, only 30% of the British and Indian soldiers taken prisoner at Kut in April 1916 were still alive with the other 70% having died in either the death march or in the POW camps. By contrast, Townshend and his officers were well treated. Only one of the officers who surrendered at Kut, the commander of a Gurkha company chose to go on the death march with his men while the rest of the officers accepted the Ottoman offer to be held separately from the other ranks. After finally making it to Baghdad where he was given a guided tour of various cultural sites, Townshend was taken to the capital of Constantinople where he was greeted with a formal guard of honour at the railroad station led by the Ottoman Minister of War, General Enver Pasha. During his trip to Constantinople, Townshend saw at least once the battered, starving, thirsty and broken-down remnants of his division travelling north on the death march. Townshend raised the subject once with Enver (who already knew about the death march as he had the POWs marched past him during a victory parade he had attended in Baghdad) who assured him that he knew nothing about the death march, but he would look into it. This was the first and only time that Townshend ever expressed concern about how his men were being treated as POWs.|$|E
60|$|One or two {{there were}} who cried out as I <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> them, swift as the hound when it speeds after the fleeing hare. But I was upon Ramiro ere any could have {{sufficiently}} mastered his surprise to interfere.|$|R
60|$|The little command {{had nearly}} reached the back road when {{the report of}} a gun rang out, coming from the {{direction}} of a wood behind the rice-fields. The bullet <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> Ben's shoulder, to bury itself in the fleshy part of one of his private's arms.|$|R
60|$|This {{morning they}} were in fine figure and bowled us along to some merry tune within; while the baby-carriages {{themselves}} jangled the bangles on their axles, making a pleasing sort of cry. The village folk turned in their steps to stare and smile as we <b>sped</b> <b>past.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cantlie, {{knowing that}} Gian {{was at least}} {{theoretically}} faster than Ptarmigan made several challenges to Armstrong to race. There {{is a story that}} one day in late August 1906 Cantlie was out in his launch in the river {{at the same time as}} Ptarmigan. Cantle seized the moment and <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> Ptarmigan with his bagpiper blasting out airs as Gian <b>sped</b> <b>past.</b> This was too much for Captain Armstrong, a master steamboat man and veteran of the Klondike Gold Rush. Armstrong ordered full steam ahead, and when Ptarmigan caught up to Gian, two or three roustabouts reached over to Gian, seized the still-playing piper, and lifted him unharmed over to the foredeck of Ptarmigan while the piper reportedly never missed a note. Ptarmigan passed Gian and thereafter Cantlie steered clear of the big steamer.|$|R
5000|$|Akhmednabi Akhmednabiyev {{died at the}} age of 54 from {{multiple}} gunshot wounds outside of his home in Semender. At 7:30 on the morning of July 9, 2013, a vehicle <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> and fired shots into Akhmednabiyev's car after he had gotten into it. The vehicle sped off and Akhmednabiyev died immediately.|$|R
60|$|Fifanti's mule, I {{have since}} reflected, was {{tethered}} near the steps. I saw the beast, but it conveyed no meaning to my mind, which I think was numbed. I <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> it and on, through the gate, round {{the road by}} the Po, under {{the walls of the}} city, and so away into the open country.|$|R

60|$|By and by {{the ground}} began to throb; the {{vibration}} got sharper, and Festing watched the track as the engine passed. Cinders rattled about him, there was a mist of snow, but he saw the cross-ties start and the rails spring up and down. Then the clanging cars <b>sped</b> <b>past,</b> and when they had gone he climbed {{down the side of}} the bank.|$|R
60|$|They went to {{the post}} office and soon {{afterwards}} the train rolled down the gorge. Jimmy helped Margaret up the steps, gave Peter his awkward thanks, and jumped on board.

5000|$|The Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit {{measures}} 4.865 km or 3.023 {{miles long}} per lap and {{runs in a}} clockwise direction. The circuit starts with the [...] "Thomson Mile", a mile-long stretch along Upper Thomson Road. Halfway through this stretch of road, there was [...] "The Hump", a right hand turn that caused drivers to lift off the ground if they <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> this bend.|$|R
60|$|Ken {{glanced at}} Gallagher and laughed. Then <b>he</b> <b>sped</b> up another high curve, which the umpire called a strike.|$|R

60|$|As though {{conscious}} of its ghastly burden, the old mare ran as {{she never had}} run before; the hedgerows and trees seemed to fly past, while sparks streamed from the flints in the road, and in an incredibly short space of time the farm-house was reached. Instinctively, Humphrey tried to guide the mare into the yard, but his efforts were powerless, for the terrified animal had got the bit in her teeth, and away she <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> the gateway.|$|R
50|$|A ship arrives, {{carrying}} {{toxic chemicals}} that have killed {{two of its}} crew members.

While Tarconi returns to headquarters to give Frank's alibi, in Odessa, Ukraine, the Environmental Agency Minister, Leonid Tomilenko, receives a threat from Ecocorp boss Johnson to reopen business negotiations.|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 2006, in {{a league}} {{encounter}} with Tottenham Hotspur, Makélélé scored his second goal for the club, a difficult curling volley {{from the edge of}} the 18-yard box which <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> goalkeeper Paul Robinson into the left-hand side of the goal to cue a bench-clearing celebration. Although Tottenham sprang a comeback to beat Chelsea 2-1, this goal got him the best shot to goals percentage that year with one shot and one goal - 100%.|$|R
50|$|The first {{successful}} probe to fly by another Solar System body was Luna 1, which <b>sped</b> <b>past</b> the Moon in 1959.

Mariner 2 was the first probe to fly by another planet, Venus, in 1962. The {{first successful}} flyby of Mars was made by Mariner 4 in 1965. Mariner 10 first passed Mercury in 1974.|$|R

6000|$|Reddy Fox didn't wait to say [...] "Good evening," [...] or to see more. Oh, no!

Bowser baying at the moon he liked to hear, but Bowser baying at his heels was another matter, and Reddy ran as he had never run before.

60|$|Honora heard him, {{and said}} {{something}} in reply. She {{tried in vain to}} rouse herself from the lethargy into which she had fallen, to cast off the spell. Up Fifth Avenue they <b>sped,</b> <b>past</b> meaningless houses, to the Park. The crystal air of evening was suffused with the level evening light; and as they wound in and out under the spreading trees she caught glimpses across the shrubbery of the deepening blue of waters. Pools of mystery were her eyes.|$|R
