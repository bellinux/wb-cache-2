5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were maintained in good condition into the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, {{as evidenced by the}} eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E

5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for similar work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Mexican control, the bay was put {{off limits}} to {{settlement}} by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration. In 1832, the settlement of Aransas City on the bay, was founded by James Power. After {{the development of the}} nearby port Lamar in 1840, Aransas City was deserted by 1846. But Lamar soon met a similar fate, after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands.|$|E

They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Anarchy, {{in which}} the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, Southampton was held by William le Gros, the Bishop of Winchester and a {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back Southampton and carried out improvements to the castle, {{as part of his}} attempt to improve the general standard of security in the south. By {{the second half of the}} 12th century, Southampton was increasingly important for coastal defence and as a base for operations on the continent. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, but no efforts were undertaken to improve the town's ditches and banks.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the interregnum, Ludlow Castle {{continued}} to be run by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel More. There was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and {{the remainder of the}} luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most of the weapons in the castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.|$|E

5|$|From 1517, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman control, {{custody of}} the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was {{subdivided}} into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 Swillington, to the {{south-east}} of Leeds, {{was still}} a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as {{the driving force of}} the local economy. Woodford was still the Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing structural work on his church in Yorkshire. It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.|$|E

5|$|In 359, Julian {{restored}} seven forts {{and town}} {{walls in the}} middle Rhine, including Bonna (Bonn) and Bingium (Bingen), obliging his new tributary Alamanni to provide the supplies and labour needed. He then crossed the Rhine, marched through {{the territory of the}} tributaries and devastated the lands of the other kings who had fought at Strasbourg, including Westralp.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lobbying of the United Fruit Company, several other factors also led the United States to launch the coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Guatemalan Revolution, military coups occurred in several other Central American countries that brought firmly anti-communist governments to power. Army officer Major Oscar Osorio won staged elections in El Salvador in 1950, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista took power in 1952. Honduras, where the land-holdings of the United Fruit Company were the most extensive, had been ruled by an anti-communist government sympathetic to the United States since 1932. These developments created tension between the other governments and Árbenz, which was exacerbated by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion. This support also worried the United States and the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. According to US historian Richard Immerman, during {{the beginning of the}} Cold War, the US and the CIA tended to assume that everybody who opposed it was a communist. Thus, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party, important figures in the US government were already predisposed to believe that the revolutionary government had been infiltrated by communists, and was a danger to the US. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the revolution, several reports and memoranda were circulated amongst US government agencies that furthered this belief.|$|E

The Selarang Barracks Incident, Double Tenth Incident and other similar stories that were mentioned by the survivors of Changi Prison are retold on the storyboard displays for posterity.
