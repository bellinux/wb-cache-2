40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the deposit quality of nickel electroforms can be enhanced by using a magnetic field. Less research work {{has been carried out}} to examine the effect of magnetic fields on the surface finish of nickel electroforms using a nickel sulphamate bath and low magnetic flux densities. In this paper it has been found that the surface finish of nickel electroforms can be improved by applying a magnetic field. The best surface finish is obtained at a magnetic field of 5 mT and at a current density of 8 A dm- 2. A change in the intensity of the (200) peak is observed in the nickel electroforms under different magnetic flux densities. In this paper the effect of a magnetic field on surface finish has been examined theoretically. it is believed that the presence of a magnetic field may increase the diffusion layer thickness and hence improve the surface <b>finish.</b> <b>Department</b> of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the adverse effects of occupational exposure to trivalent chromium. We measured chromium and iron levels in serum and urine and hemoglobin levels in tannery workers and unexposed persons. We studied three groups of subjects. Group 1 included 15 non-smoking male tannery workers highly exposed to chromium from tanning and retanning departments. Group 2 included 14 non-smoking male tannery workers with moderate chromium exposure from dying, drying and <b>finishing</b> <b>departments.</b> Group 3 included 11 healthy, non-smoking male subjects without direct chromium exposure. Higher serum chromium levels were observed in groups 1 and 2 with respect to group 3 (mean values respectively: 0. 43; 0. 25 and 0. 13 µg·l – 1). Urine chromium levels in group 1 were higher than those in controls (mean values: 1. 78 and 1. 35 µg·l – 1). In group 1 an inverse association was found between serum chromium and urine iron (– 0. 524), urine chromium and hemoglobin (– 0. 594) and between the urine chromium to iron ratio and hemoglobin (– 0. 693, p< 0. 05). The results suggest a chromium adverse effect on iron metabolism, possibly associated with excessive body chromium accumulation. In conclusion, chromium urine test could be recommended for diagnosis of chromium adverse effect on iron metabolism. Further studies are needed to quantify the relationship between urine chromium and hemoglobin metabolism...|$|R
