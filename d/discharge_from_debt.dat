40|$|In South African {{insolvency}} law, {{in as much}} as {{debt relief}} measures are contained in three pieces of legislation, a <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>debt</b> is only available to an insolvent debtor whose estate has been sequestrated and he is eventually rehabilitated. The history of South African insolvency law indicates a developmental change from a ‘harsh creditor-orientated’ approach to a ‘debtor-friendly’ approach. However, the advantage for creditors’ requirement is now firmly embedded in the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936. This requirement is not defined in the Insolvency Act but has been largely interpreted by the courts and stringently applied. It is only once the applicant for the sequestration order has extinguished the burden of proving this requirement, amongst others, will the court exercise its judicial discretion to grant or refuse the order. Consequently, this requirement creates a stumbling block for debtors wishing to use the sequestration process as a debt relief measure and force discharge of their debts on their creditors. The sequestration process is aimed at the advantage of creditors and not the relief of debtors. Overburdened debtors seeking debt relief who cannot prove advantage of creditors are therefore not considered in sequestration applications. However, although debt relief is not a primary object of the Insolvency Act, it is an indirect consequence of the sequestration process when the insolvent debtor is rehabilitated. The Insolvency Act almost deals with every aspect of the different classes of creditors while there is no provision of the different classes of debtors who can and those who cannot prove an advantage to creditors. This serves as an indication that there is an imbalance between creditors’ and debtors’ interests. The study seeks to analyse the effect of the advantage requirement on sequestration applications from a debtor’s perspective. The alternative debt relief measures available to debtors when pursued by their creditors as contained in the Magistrates` Court Act 32 of 1944 and the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 are examined. It is submitted that South Africa does not provide the required sufficient debt relief because the administration orders and debt review in addition to other deficiencies, do not provide debtors with a statutory discharge from debts. The South African Law Reform Commission in the 2000 Insolvency Bill has recommended that the advantage for creditors’ requirement be retained in the new Insolvency Act. In a comparative survey, various legal systems are considered to investigate how the issue of finding a balance between debtors’ and creditors’ interests in insolvency law is dealt with. To accommodate all debtors, it is then submitted that the advantage requirement should not be retained in the Insolvency Act. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

Over-indebtedness is a general social problem as all age groups get overburdened with debt. However, it is important to focus on the issue of young people's over-indebtedness directly because the young generation represents people who are or will be active in the general working process. The authoress of the thesis points out the young generation's over-indebtedness and provides an overview of development of this issue in 2008 - 2015.

In her work, the authoress also outlines a gradual development of possible indebtedness, which primarily includes loans, from both banks and other institutions, followed by a court procedure and execution of the judgement.

40|$|ENG) DISCHARGE OF A DEBTOR - ONE OF MODES OF INSOLVENCY SOLUTION This diploma thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{detailed}} overview of the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>debts</b> in the insolvency proceedings. The debt relief was incorporated into the Czech legal system by the Insolvency act, No. 182, 2006 Coll, which entered into force on the January 1 st 2008. The idea of debt discharge was led by an intention to provide highest possible and proportional satisfaction equally to all creditors {{and in the same}} time, to protect debtor's right to decent living conditions. In the case of successful debt discharge, the debtor is forgiven part of his debts, as long as he performs his good will during entire insolvency process. The debtor must not have any debts originated in his business activities, unless he specifically agrees on an exception with the creditor. This determinates a debt discharge to be used mainly by individual persons, not by companies. Also, the final creditors' satisfaction must reach at least 30 % of debtor's claims. We distinguish two forms of debt discharge. In the first case, which is called audition, all debtor's assets are sold out and received funds are used for creditors' satisfaction. In the second case, which uses agreed payment schedule, all debtor's income over the minimum base is regularly [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{for individuals to}} be <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>debt</b> in bankruptcy proceedings and the awfulness of debtors prison made the introduction of modern companies legislation, and general availability of limited liability, all the more urgent. The first step was the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, which allowed companies to be created through registration rather than a Royal Charter. It was accompanied by the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844, which envisaged a separate procedure to bring a company {{to an end and}} liquidate the assets. Companies had legal personality separate from its incorporators, but only with the Limited Liability Act 1855 would a company's investors be generally protected <b>from</b> extra <b>debts</b> upon a company's insolvency. The 1855 Act limited investors' liability to the amount they had invested, so if someone bought shares in a company that ran up massive debts in insolvency, the shareholder could not be asked for more than he had already paid in. Thus, the risk of debtors' prison was reduced. Soon after, reforms were made for all indebted people. The Bankruptcy Act 1861 was passed allowing all people, not just traders, to file for bankruptcy. The Debtors Act 1869 finally abolished imprisonment for debt altogether. So the legislative scheme of this period came to roughly resemble the modern law. While the general principle remained pari passu among the insolvent company's creditors, the claims of liquidators expenses and wages of workers were given statutory priority over other unsecured creditors. However, any creditor who had contracted for a security interest would be first in the priority queue. Completion of insolvency protection followed UK company law's leading case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd. Here a Whitechapel bootmaker had incorporated his business, but because of economic struggles, he had been forced into insolvency. The Companies Act 1862 required a minimum of seven shareholders, so he had registered his wife and children as nominal shareholders, even though they played little or no part in the business. The liquidator of Mr Salomon's company sued him to personally pay the outstanding debts of his company, arguing that he should lose the protection of limited liability given that the other shareholders were not genuine investors. Salomon's creditors were particularly aggrieved because Salomon himself had taken a floating charge, over all the company's present and future assets, and so his claims for debt against the company had ranked in priority to theirs. The House of Lords held that, even though the company was a one-man venture in substance, anybody who duly registered would have the protection of the Companies Acts in the event of insolvency. Salomon's case effectively completed the process 19th century reforms because any person, even the smallest business, could have protection from destitution following business insolvency.|$|R

40|$|Bankruptcy is {{a federal}} court {{procedure}} intended to benefit both debtors and creditors if a debtor is unable to pay all obligations. Filing bankruptcy' stops, or stays, all creditor's debt-collection procedures. The stay is to prevent some creditors from receiving more than their fair share from a financially distressed debtor. A bankruptcy trustee is usually appointed {{to assist in the}} fair distribution of the debtor's property. Equitable distribution of the debtor's property also is furthered by the trustee's avoidance powers, the debtor's exempt property, and the court's <b>discharging</b> the debtor <b>from</b> unpaid obligations. There are two basic types of bankruptcy proceedings [...] liquidation and reorganization. Chapter 7 liquidation provides for the sale of the debtor's primary assets, distribution of proceeds to creditors, and discharge of remaining unpaid debts. Then, except for property specified as exempt by North Dakota law, the assets of the debtor are sold and the proceeds distributed among the creditors. Subsequently, the debtor is <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> most remaining <b>debts</b> and given the opportunity to financially "start fresh. " Chapters 11, 12, and 13 of the Bankruptcy Code permit reorganization of the debtor's financial affairs and payment to creditors from the debtor's property and future income. A debtor is granted time to devise a plan of reorganization that may include rescheduling payments, selling some assets to reduce debt, forgiving debt, and implementing changes to increase the business' efficiency and profitability. Chapter 12 bankruptcy is intended to meet the unique problems encountered in reorganizing a farm business. Agricultural Finance, Farm Management, Financial Economics,...|$|R

Then, we calculated the <b>discharges</b> <b>from</b> glaciers and glacier-free areaFurthermore, we analyzed the sensitivity of those discharges to meteorological factor. The result revealed that calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area increased with precipitation. Meanwhile, calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glaciers decreased with precipitation. Since little precipitation cause expose the glacier ice surface, which can absorb almost solar radiation, then glacier melt accelerated. Then, relatively large <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier can be provided when the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area is less. Therefore, <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier {{make up for the}} shortage of <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area due to less precipitation.

40|$|Imagine {{buying a}} game from a seller and {{promising}} to repay {{him at a}} later date. However, instead of repayment, you decide to give the game to your friend, who in turn allows you to use it. Then your friend declares bankruptcy to discharge {{the price of the}} game <b>from</b> his <b>debts,</b> thus allowing you both to use it without paying. This repayment runaround is the issue that the First and Fifth Circuits were asked to decide in two recent cases. Specifically, the question was whether a debt incurred by “actual fraud” may be discharged by the recipient of the transfer without a misrepresentation of repayment. The Bankruptcy Code (“the Code”) serves as a vehicle to help those who have encountered unsuccessful ventures to discharge their obligations and start anew. The Code does not, however, grant a debtor the absolute right of discharge, as many exceptions exist to prevent fraudulent behavior. One of these exceptions is 11 U. S. C. § 523 (a) (2) (A), which excepts <b>from</b> <b>discharge</b> any <b>debt</b> obtained by “false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud. ” Circuit courts have differed in their application of the statute, thus creating a circuit split concerning whether a debtor must make a misrepresentation in order to constitute “actual fraud. ” This Note argues that “actual fraud” is meant to encompass a fraudulent transferee’s intent to defraud and does not require a misrepresentation concerning the prospect of repayment. By focusing on the transferee’s intent, these debts would be nondischargeable, thus requiring repayment to the seller...|$|R
