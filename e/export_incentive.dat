40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes on the Performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria, using quarterly time series data from 1990 - 2014. The study employed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to cointegration analysis and Granger causality test to examine the long run and causality relationship between growth in the Performance of agricultural exports and <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes in Nigeria. The bounds tests {{used in the study}} revealed that there is no long run equilibrium relationship between <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes and the performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria. It is of high importance to note that the granger casualty test indicates that there was a unidirectional relationship running from agricultural export (AGR) to export expansion grant (EEG), export development fund (EDF) to agricultural export (AGR). Since the findings of the study show that export development fund has positive and significant impact on the performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria, the study suggests that major concern should be given to its management and disbursement to ensure stable growth in the sub-component (agriculture) of non-oil export in Nigeria. This can be achieved through adequate funding by the concerned authority. Keywords. Export incentives, Non-oil exports, Causality, ARDL, Nigeria. JEL. J 43, Q 00, Q 10...|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the productivity of labour in the South African textile industry. This was achieved by firstly looking at the theoretical background which will facilitate the calculation of labour productivity. The Cobb-Douglas production function was found to be most suitable to estimate labour productivity in the South African textile industry. Conditions necessary and sufficient for equilibrium to hold were explored which gave an indication on efficiency in the allocation of input factors, capital and labour. South African textile industry's performance over the years has been influenced by the changing trade policies brought about by the Uruguay round of talks of 15 December 1993. The talks concluded that countries should reduce tariffs and embark on export-led growth. Exporters should have free access to imported intermediate inputs and countries should do away with anti export bias associated with import protection. Inevitably the South African textiles industry was affected by the conclusions drawn at the Uruguay Round of talks. The textile industry which had enjoyed growth under high protection tariffs and other import duties had shed down the high tariffs and liberalise trade. But the tariff reductions had to happen over the period ranging between five and twelve years. This further implied that <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes will have to be eliminated as they were in contradiction with GATT Agreement so, R 2 billion that the government had budgeted for the General <b>Export</b> <b>Incentive</b> Scheme will have to be dispensed with and according to GATT South Africa has been given three years to dispose of the <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme. ix The long term strategy for the textile industry was formulated as an industrial strategy to prepare the industry for the changing policies. The long term objectives emphasised on achieving international competitiveness, labour demanding growth to foster employment in the textile industry and lastly to supply local consumers with textiles at affordable prices. But it should be noted that trying to gain international competitiveness imply laying off workers as new technology comes in. This is in contradiction with the Industrial strategy which advocates for labour absorbing economic growth in the textile industry especially in the light of the fact that employment has been on the decline over the years and it is expected that the new industrial strategy, will be able to create more jobs...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the incentives to export that Lebanese entrepreneurs face when engaging in international business. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on an empirical investigation of the incentives to export that Lebanese firms face when engaging in international business. The sample of firms came from a wide cross section of industries and was provided by the Lebanese Ministry of Industry. A questionnaire was developed and pre-tested using a small sample of exporters with the final instrument used to personally interview all respondents. Findings: A total of 17 of the 20 export incentives tested were identified as being significantly important. Also, it was concluded that exporters and non-exporters largely agree in their views of the various incentives to exporting. Research limitations/implications: One of the research limitations was the sampling technique. Convenience sampling was used in this project. Although it has many advantages, it also has some limitations, including respondent self-selection. Practical implications: The study findings suggest that exporters and non-exporters perceive the same incentives to export to be important. However, exporters and non-exporters had different attitudes towards one <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> being “Decline in the Value of Currency Relative to Foreign Markets”. Originality/value: From the multiple comparisons test conducted on “Decline in the Value of Currency Relative to Foreign Markets” for those who export 11 percent to 40 percent of their total sales and those who export 41 percent or more of their total sales the attitudes towards this <b>export</b> <b>incentive</b> are significantly different from each other...|$|E

40|$|India's {{trade policy}} regime has changed {{dramatically}} since July 1991. The objective of reform has been to improve export performance by improving <b>export</b> <b>incentives</b> and eliminating discretionary controls. Using a simple model, the author sets out to examine whether <b>export</b> <b>incentives</b> actually improved {{as a result of}} policy changes. One part of the two-part model compares export profitability across regimes, The other compares the gap between domestic and export profitability across regimes. The export base is divided into eight subsectors, and several simulation exercises are applied to each of them. The main results: 1) For most export sectors, export profitability was lower under the dual exchange rate regime (March 1992 - February 1993) than in the period before July 1991; 2) the gap between domestic and export profitability increased in the period of the dual exchange rate regime, meaning that domestic sales, already more attractive than export sales, became even more so; 3) this adverse movement in <b>export</b> <b>incentives</b> was reversed with unification of the exchange rate in March 1993. Overall, the regime has moved closer to its eventual goal of being neutral about import subsitution and exportpromotion, which is reflected in a significant change in the attitude of India's corporate sector toward exports. It is more than a coincidence that the export surge in fiscal 1993 - 94 was led mainly by the sectors that witnessed the greatest increase in export profitability.
