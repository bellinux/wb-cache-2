40|$|Background: Semantic network {{abnormalities}} {{in patients}} with psychotic disorder were examined using associative prime-target relations with two stimulus asynchronies (SOAs; - 250 ms and - 500 ms) to assess {{the time course of}} automatic and more controlled processes of semantic priming. To investigate whether an aberrant semantic network system is part of the familial liability for psychosis, healthy siblings of patients with psychotic disorder were additionally examined. The N 400 event-related brain potential (ERP) was used as a probe of semantic processing. Method: Twenty-two patients with psychotic disorder, twenty siblings of patients with psychotic disorder and twenty controls participated in a lexical decision task and ERPs were recorded to target words that were associatively, indirectly or not related to their preceding prime word. Results: Associative priming of the N 400 amplitude was found across all participants and both SOAs, but no between-group differences were found for the N 400 amplitude (both SOAs). The Group × Condition interaction of the <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> N 400 latency of the three groups was just short of statistical significance (F 2, 59 = 2. 7, p =. 077). Patients showed an increased <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> effect of the N 400 latency only at short SOA, with decreased latency of the indirectly related compared to the unrelated condition, while controls did not show an <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> N 400 latency effect. No between-group differences in N 400 latency of <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> were found at the long SOA. Only a trend towards a Group × Condition interaction of the <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> N 400 latency between the sibling and the controls was found, but without a main effect of <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> in the sibling group. Conclusion: These preliminary results support the assumption of a hyperactive semantic network {{in patients with}} psychotic disorder, which develops under automatic processes and decreases with more controlled processes, but does not represent clear trait familial liability. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Introduction: Schizotypy is {{a useful}} {{schizophrenia}} analogue that controls for confounding factors such as medication and general intellectual decline. In the current study this analogue approach {{was used to examine}} implicit/explicit and direct/indirect semantic memory function. This is the first study to examine both implicit and explicit semantic access in the same schizotypy sample. Methods: Participants completed four semantic tasks: (1) implicit <b>indirect</b> <b>priming,</b> (2) implicit direct priming, (3) explicit object (indirect) task, and (4) explicit association (direct) task. The schizophrenia literature suggests that semantic impairments are associated with thought disorder. As such, participants were divided into low (n= 18) and high (n= 18) schizotypy groups based on their responses to a thought disorder subscale of the Oxford Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-Life) scale. Results: In terms of implicit performance, the high schizotypy group demonstrated increased direct priming but nonsignificant <b>indirect</b> <b>priming.</b> The low schizotypy group demonstrated no significant difference in direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>priming.</b> Performance on the explicit tasks was equivalent between the two groups for direct stimuli. On the indirect explicit task, high schizotypy was associated with an increase in errors. Conclusions: Increased direct priming in high schizotypy is equivalent to that seen in schizophrenia, which has been interpreted as increased spreading of activation. Abnormal performance using the indirect stimuli was found across implicit and explicit versions. The relevance of these findings to schizophrenia are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Norepinephrine and {{dopamine}} {{are both}} believed to affect signal-to-noise in the cerebral cortex. Dopaminergic agents appear to modulate semantic networks during <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming,</b> {{but do not}} appear to affect problem solving dependent on access to semantic networks. Noradrenergic agents, though, do affect semantic network dependent problem solving. We wished to examine whether noradrenergic agents affect <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming.</b> Subjects attended three sessions: one each after propranolol (40 mg) (noradrenergic antagonist), ephedrine (25 mg) (noradrenergic agonist), and placebo. During each session, closely related, distantly related, and unrelated pairs were presented. Reaction times for a lexical decision task on the target words (second word in the pair) were recorded. No decrease in <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming</b> occurred with ephedrine. Furthermore, across all three drugs, a main effect of semantic relatedness was found, but no main effect of drug, and no drug/semantic relatedness interaction effect. These findings suggest that noradrenergic agents, with these drugs and at these doses, do not affect <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming</b> with the potency of dopaminergic drugs at the doses previously studied. In the context of this previous work, this suggests that more automatic processes such as priming and more controlled searches of the lexical and semantic networks such as problem solving may be mediated, at least in part, by distinct mechanisms with differing effects of pharmacological modulation...|$|R

40|$|Evidence is accumulating that {{suggests}} that semantic networks are abnormal in schizophrenia. To investigate this further, we examined priming in 42 schizophrenics and 28 normal controls on a lexical decision task involving three different prime-target conditions all at 700 ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) : directly semantically related, indirectly semantically related, and unrelated; and three types of emotional pairings: positive, negative, and neutral. Two schizophrenic groups were compared: nondeluded (no current delusions) and deluded. Schizophrenic patients did not demonstrate significant direct priming overall, whereas controls did. However, when material was examined according to emotional pairing, the controls and deluded subjects demonstrated significant priming to neutral word pairs. Neither schizophrenic group showed direct priming with positive and negative word pairings, the deluded subjects showing inhibition of priming with negative stimuli. Controls failed to show direct priming with negative stimuli. <b>Indirect</b> <b>priming</b> was obtained in all groups. The absence of direct priming and <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> with negative material in deluded subjects was particularly striking.

40|$|Semantic memory {{deficits in}} {{schizophrenia}} (SZ) are profound, {{yet there is}} no research comparing implicit and explicit semantic processing in the same participant sample. In the current study, both implicit and explicit priming are investigated using direct (LION-TIGER) and indirect (LION-STRIPES; where tiger is not displayed) stimuli comparing SZ to healthy controls. Based on a substantive review (Rossell and Stefanovic, 2007) and meta-analysis (Pomarol-Clotet et al., 2008) it was predicted that SZ would be associated with increased <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> implicitly. Further, it was predicted that SZ would be associated with abnormal <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> explicitly replicating the work of (Assaf et al., 2006). No specific hypotheses were made for implicit direct priming due to the heterogeneity of the literature. It was hypothesised that explicit direct priming would be intact based on the structured nature of this task. The pattern of results suggests (1) intact reaction time (RT) and error performance implicitly in the face of abnormal direct priming and (2) impaired RT and error performance explicitly. This pattern confirms general findings regarding implicit/explicit memory impairments in SZ whilst highlighting the unique pattern of performance specific tosemantic priming. Finally, priming performance is discussed in relation to thought disorder and length of illness...|$|E
40|$|The {{schizophrenia}} {{research literature}} contains many differing accounts of semantic memory function in schizophrenia as assessed through the semantic priming paradigm. Most recently, Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) {{have been used}} to demonstrate both increased and decreased semantic priming at a neural level in schizophrenia patients, relative to healthy controls. The present study used ERPs to investigate the role of behavioral task in determining neural semantic priming effects in schizophrenia. The same schizophrenia patients and healthy controls completed two experiments in which word stimuli were identical, and the time between the onset of prime and target remained constant at 350 ms: in the first, participants monitored for words within a particular semantic category that appeared only in filler items (implicit task); in the second, participants explicitly rated the relatedness of word-pairs (explicit task). In the explicit task, schizophrenia patients showed reduced direct and <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming</b> in comparison with healthy controls.

40|$|Aberrant {{semantic}} processing {{has been}} linked to the etiology of formal thought disorder (TD) symptoms in schizophrenia. In this cross-sectional study, two prominent theories, overactivation and disorganized structure of semantic memory (SM), were examined in relation to TD symptoms using the continuum approach across two established semantic tasks (direct/indirect semantic priming and categorical fluency). The aim was to examine the validity of the two TD theories in relation to TD symptoms in schizophrenia. Greater direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>priming,</b> fluency productivity and category errors were expected if the data supported the overactivation theory. Reduced fluency productivity and increased category errors would be characteristic of disorganized storage. Fifty-seven schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 48 controls completed a clinical assessment and the semantic tasks. There was significantly reduced direct priming in patients compared to controls (p<. 05), while <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> was not significantly different; there was no association between TD and degree of priming. Patients produced more category-inappropriate words (p<. 005) than controls, which was related to increasing severity of circumstantiality. The pattern of results was more indicative of a disorganized SM storage problem in this sample. This phenomenon may underlie some TD symptoms in general schizophrenia. The findings strengthen the relationship between SM deficits and TD symptoms, though this appears to differ between individual symptoms. The authors discuss the value of the continuum approach in addressing research questions in TD etiology.

40|$|Aberrant {{semantic}} processing {{has been}} linked to the aetiology of formal thought disorder (TD) symptoms in schizophrenia. Two prominent theories, overactivation and disorganized structure of semantic memory, were examined in relation to TD using both implicit (priming) and explicit (fluency) semantic tasks. This study aimed to examine if both theories operated independently or in tandem; and if this differed at the implicit and explicit levels. Greater direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>priming,</b> fluency productivity and category errors were expected for the overactivation theory. Reduced direct priming, fluency productivity and increased category errors would be characteristic of disorganized storage. 57 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 48 controls completed a clinical assessment and the semantic tasks. Results showed significantly reduced direct priming in patients compared to controls (p<. 05), while the greater <b>indirect</b> <b>priming</b> was not significant. There was no association between TD and degree of priming. Patients were less likely to recognize a non-word in a task with more related pairs (p<. 05), degrading with severity of positive TD (r=. 30, p<. 001). Although patients produced more category inappropriate words (p<. 005), TD overall did not influence fluency error rates, although negative TD was associated with reduced category and letter productivity (p<. 001). Misattribution, but not semantic overactivation, at the implicit level appears related to TD. At the explicit level, negative TD appears more associated with slower processing than inaccuracy. Overall, the findings support semantic disorganization as a more trait-type impairment contributing to TD symptoms, with overactivation perhaps more characteristic of the acute TD state. Executive dysfunction may combine with semantic dysfunction in the presentation of TD symptomatology...|$|E
40|$|A {{blend of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from plants induced by herbivory enables the priming of defensive responses in neighboring plants. These effects may provide insights useful for pest control achieved with transgenic-plantemitted volatiles. We therefore investigated, under both laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the priming of defense responses in plants (lima bean and corn) by exposing them to transgenic-plant-volatiles (VOCos) including (E) -b-ocimene, emitted from transgenic tobacco plants (NtOS 2) that were constitutively overexpressing (E) -b-ocimene synthase. When lima bean plants {{that had previously been}} placed downwind of NtOS 2 in an open-flow tunnel were infested by spider mites, they were more defensive to spider mites and more attractive to predatory mites, in comparison to the infested plants that had been placed downwind of wild-type tobacco plants. This was similarly observed when the NtOS 2 -downwind maize plants were infested with Mythimna separata larvae, resulting in reduced larval growth and greater attraction of parasitic wasps (Cotesia kariyai). In a greenhouse experiment, we also found that lima bean plants (VOCos-receiver plants) placed near NtOS 2 were more attractive when damaged by spider mites, in comparison to the infested plants that had been placed near the wild-type plants. More intriguingly, VOCs emitted from infested VOCos-receiver plants affected their conspecific neighboring plants to <b>prime</b> <b>indirect</b> defenses in response to herbivory. Altogether, these data suggest that transgenicplant-emitted volatiles can enhance the ability to <b>prime</b> <b>indirect</b> defenses via both plant-plant and plant-plant-plan...|$|R

Crucially, priming was also analyzed {{as a function of}} participants’ positive schizotypal features (magical ideation, MI), previously found to be associated with an enhanced semantic spreading activation (SSA) within the right hemisphere. Across both priming conditions, we observed increased semantic priming in the levodopa group 1) specifically after right visual field stimulations and 2) in high MI scorers. In both instances, increased semantic priming emerged from exceedingly long reaction times to unrelated targets reflecting 1) the left hemisphere’s specialization for closely related concepts and 2) an opposite association between MI and SSA in the levodopa as compared with the placebo group. As a final finding, low MI scorers under levodopa performed like high MI scorers under placebo. Our findings speak against a general dopaminergic focusing of SSA, but one that respects each hemisphere’s specialization. They also suggest that individuals’ schizotypal features are important determinants of dopamine-induced changes in hemispheric functioning. We note that, in psychiatric patients, dopamine antagonists reportedly restore unusual lateralization.

The current study utilized both acute ketamine administration in healthy volunteers and chronic ketamine abusers to investigate semantic processing, {{one of the key}} cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Semantic processing was examined using a semantic priming paradigm. In experiment 1, acute effects of low (75 ng/mL) and high (150 ng/mL) ketamine doses were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind independent group design with 48 participants. In experiment 2, 19 regular recreational ketamine users were compared with 19 ketamine-naive polydrug controls and 26 non-drug-using controls. In both experiments, semantic priming parameters were manipulated to distinguish between ketamine's effects on (1) automatic and strategic processing and (2) the facilitation and inhibition components of semantic priming for strongly (directly) related primes and targets. Acute effects of ketamine on semantic priming for weakly (indirectly) related primes and targets were also assessed in experiment 1. Acutely, ketamine impaired the employment of strategic mechanisms but not automatic processing within both the direct and <b>indirect</b> semantic <b>priming</b> tasks. Acute ketamine administration also induced clear schizophrenia-like symptoms.

Furthermore, we showed that manipulating the pairings between stimuli and stop signals, in a manner that favored the formation of stimulus-stop associations, produced enhanced stop learning effects on reaction time, but not probability of responding. Our results suggest that perceptual processes supporting signal detection (priming) as well as inhibitory processes are involved in inhibitory control training, and that inhibition training may benefit from reducing the contingency between stimuli and stop-signals.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} findings in studies of schizophrenics with thought disorders is their peculiar pattern of semantic priming, which presumably reflects abnormal associative processes in the semantic system of these patients. Semantic priming is manifested by faster and more accurate recognition of a word-target when preceded by a semantically related prime, relative to an unrelated prime condition. Compared to control, semantic priming in schizophrenics is characterized by reduced priming effects at long prime-target Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) and, sometimes, augmented priming at short SOA. In addition, unlike controls, schizophrenics consistently show indirect (mediated) priming (such as from the prime ‘wedding ’ to the target ‘finger’, mediated by ‘ring’). In a previous study, we developed a novel attractor neural network model with synaptic adaptation mechanisms that could account for semantic priming patterns in healthy individuals. Here, we examine the consequences of introducing attractor instability to this network, which is hypothesized to arise from dysfunctional synaptic transmission known to occur in schizophrenia. In two simulated experiments, we demonstrate how such instability speeds up the network’s dynamics and, consequently, produces {{the full spectrum of}} priming effects previously reported in patients. The model also explains the inconsistency of augmented priming results at short SOAs using directly related pairs relative to the consistency of <b>indirect</b> <b>priming.</b> Further, we discuss how the same mechanism could account for other symptoms of the disease, such as derailment (‘loose associations’) or the commonl...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} prefrontal Cortex (PFC) {{in higher}} {{cognitive}} functions – including working memory, conflict resolution, set shifting and semantic processing – has been demonstrated unequivocally. Despite the great heterogeneity among tasks measuring these phenotypes, {{due in part to}} the different cognitive sub-processes implied and the specificity of the stimulus material used, there is agreement that all of these tasks recruit an executive control system located in the PFC. On a biochemical level it is known that the dopaminergic system plays an important role in executive control functions. Evidence comes from molecular genetics relating the functional COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism to working memory and set shifting. In order determine whether this pattern of findings generalises to linguistic and semantic processing, we investigated the effects of the COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism in lexical decision making using masked and unmasked versions of the semantic priming paradigm on N[*]=[*] 104 healthy subjects. Although we observed strong priming effects in all conditions (masked priming, unmasked priming with short/long stimulus asynchronies (SOAs), direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>priming),</b> COMT was not significantly related to priming, suggesting no reliable influence on semantic processing. However, COMT Val 158 Met was strongly associated with lexical decision latencies in all priming conditions if considered separately, explaining between 9 and 14. 5 % of the variance. Therefore, the findings indicate that COMT mainly influences more general executive control functions in the PFC supporting the speed of lexical decisions...|$|E
40|$|Posthypoglycemic {{metabolic}} {{changes have}} been studied predominantly during waning of insulin action. We evaluated the effects of hypoglycemic counterregulation on glucose and lipid metabolism during continuous insulin infusion. Glucose was infused at a constant rate throughout the study (4 mg. kg- 1. min- 1). During {{the second part of}} the study, plasma glucose levels were clamped at approximately 4 mM by variable insulin infusion. In six subjects, but not in five control subjects, short-term hypoglycemia (nadir plasma glucose 2. 80 +/- 0. 05 mM) was induced by an additional bolus injection of insulin before starting insulin infusion. Substrate oxidation rates and plasma substrate fluxes were determined by <b>indirect</b> calorimetry and <b>primed</b> continuous infusions of [3 - 3 H]glucose and [14 C]palmitate. After hypoglycemia, higher insulin infusion rates than in the control group were required to clamp plasma glucose concentrations at similar levels (p < 0. 05). Additionally, insulin levels were increased compared with those in control subjects (p < 0. 01). There were no differences in substrate oxidation rates, hepatic glucose production, or lipolysis after hypoglycemia. In conclusion, the counterregulatory hormonal response after short-lasting mild hypoglycemia with sustained modest hyperinsulinemia and constant glucose availability induces insulin resistance with respect to glucose uptake but is unable to stimulate hepatic glucose production or lipolysi...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{can prepare}} for future {{herbivore}} attack {{through a process}} called priming. Primed plants respond more strongly and/or faster to insect attack succeeding the priming event than nonprimed plants, while the energetic costs of priming are relatively low. To better understand the evolution of priming, we developed a simulation model, partly parameterized for Brassica nigra plants, to explore how the fitness benefits of priming change when plants are grown in different biotic environments. Model simulations showed that herbivore dynamics (arrival probability, arrival time, and feeding rate) affect the optimal duration, the optimal investment and the fitness benefits of priming. Competition for light increases the <b>indirect</b> costs of <b>priming,</b> but may also result in a larger payoff when the nonprimed plant experiences substantial leaf losses. This modeling approach identified some important knowledge gaps: herbivore arrival rates on individual plants are rarely reported but they shape the optimal duration of priming, and it would pay off if the likelihood, severity and timing of the attack could be discerned from the priming cue, but it is unknown if plants can do so. In addition, the model generated some testable predictions, for example that the sensitivity to the priming cue decreases with plant age...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the metabolic effects of Gaucher's disease, glucose metabolism and parameters of fat metabolism were studied by <b>indirect</b> calorimetry and <b>primed</b> continuous infusion of [3 - 3 H]glucose in seven clinically stable untreated patients with type 1 Gaucher's disease and in seven healthy matched control subjects. Studies were {{performed in the}} postabsorptive state. In Gaucher patients, resting energy expenditure was increased by approximately 24 % (29. 4 +/- 0. 7 vs. 23. 7 +/- 0. 8 kcal/kg. day; P < 0. 01). Glucose production was increased by approximately 30 % in patients compared to controls (14. 00 +/- 0. 51 vs. 10. 77 +/- 0. 26; P < 0. 01), although plasma glucose concentrations and net glucose oxidation were not different. Although C peptide concentrations were not different, insulin concentrations were slightly increased in Gaucher patients (P < 0. 05). The differences in basal glucose production were not related to differences in plasma concentrations of insulin or other glucoregulatory hormones. In conclusion, the increase in basal glucose production is a remarkable feature of type 1 Gaucher's disease, which cannot merely be explained by endocrine mechanisms. Because Gaucher's disease is manifested within the liver in macrophages, but not in hepatocytes, altered intrahepatic regulatory mechanisms might {{be involved in this}} increase in glucose productio...|$|R
