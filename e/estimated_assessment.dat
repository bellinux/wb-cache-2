40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of full scale measurements of the underbody flow characteristics and track behaviour beneath a high speed train on a line in the south of England. Simultaneous measurements were made of the flow velocities and pressures beneath the train, sleeper displacements and ballast accelerations. The results showed that, while the mechanical measurements of displacement and acceleration were essentially deterministic and varied little from one train passage to another, the aerodynamic measurements were highly variable with substantial run-to-run variation. Vertical ballast accelerations with peaks greater than the acceleration due to gravity were measured for short durations. Velocity and turbulence intensity profiles were derived, from which aerodynamic shear forces at the ballast surface were <b>estimated.</b> <b>Assessment</b> of the magnitudes of the different forces acting on the ballast showed that the mechanical forces associated with track displacement and the aerodynamic forces were of similar order of magnitude on well performing track.

In the present study, a method for the solubilization of ABS from rat uterus microsomal fractions by using 3 -(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio- 1 -propanesulphonate (CHAPS; 20 mM) and KCl (0. 4 M) is described. Decreasing the CHAPS concentration below the critical micelle concentration led to long-term stabilization of the protein. All of the membrane-bound ABS was recovered in the extract, and only one class of binding site, with a high affinity for [3 H]tamoxifen (KA = 5 x 10 (8) M- 1) was detectable. This binding was time-dependent and reversible: at 4 degrees C, the association rate constant was ka = 7. 2 x 10 (4) M- 1. s- 1, and the reverse rate constant was kd = 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) s- 1. Solubilized ABS exhibited an affinity and specificity {{similar to those of the}} membrane-bound sites. Under disaggregating conditions, solubilized ABS had an apparent sedimentation coefficient, s 20,w, of 5. 2 S and a Stokes radius of 6. 4 nm.

40|$|A new {{and more}} {{comprehensive}} estimation method for stock-production models is proposed, to provide more reliable stock assessment when data availability is limited. Using difference equations to implement a non-equilibrium production model, the new approach (named POEEM, for Process and Observation Errors Estimation Method) incorporates uncertainties due to both process and observation errors, employing a non-linear model fitting approach. The method has been evaluated using both simulated and real data sets, and {{has been applied to}} data from some Brazilian fish stocks. The weighting ratio between process and observation errors {{has proved to be a}} crucial factor in determining the model results, and a fully satisfactory method for selecting this ratio is still required. Sensitivity analyses conducted with the simulated data have been used to study the behaviour of the method for a range of exploitation and noise levels. Data series with low and medium levels of noise yielded consistent results irrespective of the level of exploitation, whereas very noisy data series did not provide reliable results. For comparison, data from a previously analysed stock was also tested with POEEM and resulted in peculiar results for the stock status and management advice. Data from four demersal species caught o® southeastern Brazilian coast were also analysed employing POEEM, and more conventional methods. For all of them further analyses on mapping some parameters sensitivity must be conducted in order to increased the reliability of the results. Two species have the POEEM <b>estimated</b> <b>assessment</b> trend corroborated by independent biological studies. King weakfish is apparently on the verge of a collapse, with very low levels of production and biomass. Jamaican weakfish is around its maximum sustainable yield and the exploitation level on this stock should not be intensified. For the other two species, high levels of uncertainty were responsible for contradictory outcomes. For whitemouth croaker, the balance between process and observation error could not be consistently achieved, because of high amount of observation noises. For grey triggerfish, the assessment revealed a collapsed stock, but previous biological studies do not corroborate this scenario. Discarding onboard and fleet behaviour appear to be confusing the analysis of this data series. In general, the new method seems to be capable of giving useful results, consistent with biological studies, when a limited amount of data is available. However, further work is needed to find a satisfactory method for fixing the weighting ratio. In order to improve the Brazilian stock assessments, both fishery and biological data must be continuously collected to maintain and update the results, and e®ort data needs to be collected for other fleets, and incorporated in the analysis.

40|$|The Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 (hereinafter {{referred}} to as the “TAA”) has changed the law governing assessments. The introduction of jeopardy assessments in South African tax law is a new concept. The term <b>estimated</b> <b>assessment</b> previously used in tax Acts, is replaced by the concept of an original, reduced, additional or jeopardy assessment based on an estimation. If the audit process establishes that the original assessment was not correctly issued, SARS can issue an additional assessment. SARS has the right to issue an additional assessment {{despite the fact that the}} original assessment became final and conclusive. The TAA provides for simplified grounds on which additional assessments may be issued to achieve alignment across taxes. A new simplified concept prejudice to SARS or the fiscus will be used as a basis for the issue of additional assessments. Jeopardy assessments (as provided for in section 94 of the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011), also known as a ‘protective assessment’, are introduced which may be issued in advance of the date on which the return is normally due in order to secure the early collection of tax that would otherwise be in jeopardy or where there is some danger of tax being lost by delay. SARS bears the onus and a taxpayer has the right to take the matter on review to the High Court. The Supreme Court of Appeal has held that it is well established that, in review proceedings, only under certain exceptions will a court substitute its own decision for that of an official to whom the decision has been entrusted, the exceptions being where the proper decision is a foregone conclusion or where the decision-maker has disabled himself from making a proper decision. The impression is thus gained that the purpose of a jeopardy assessment under South African law is to shorten the period within which tax is payable and not to do to away with the requirement to give notice of an assessment. A termination assessment (IRC 6851) applies to the current tax year, or the immediately preceding tax year if the due date for the return has not passed. If jeopardy is determined, the taxpayer’s tax year is terminated and treated as a complete tax year for assessment purposes. Termination assessments are made for income taxes only. A jeopardy assessment applies to a closed tax year, where the due date for filing a return has expired. For income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes, assessment is made pursuant to IRC 6861. For other kinds of taxes (employment and other excise taxes), assessment is made pursuant to IRC 6862.

Among the FPs, ruthenium {{is of particular interest}} due to its ability to form volatile oxide compounds in highly oxidizing conditions. In addition, Ru is a very hazardous compound because it is chemically toxic and also because of its radiotoxicity. The topic of ruthenium is examined in terms of nuclear safety issues. A review of the literature regarding ruthenium oxides properties, gaseous and aqueous chemistry is compiled. The study focuses on the ruthenium tetroxide (RuO 4) which is highly reactive and volatile, and is the most likely gaseous chemical form under the conditions prevailing in the containment. The interactions between ruthenium oxides and containment surfaces, which could be of main importance in the overall Ru behaviour, are also discussed. Finally, an evaluation of the possible revolatilisation phenomena of ruthenium adsorbed on PWR containment surfaces, or dissolved in the sump, under super-oxidizing conditions (radiolysis), is also presented.
