40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations of the ORC system with two scroll expanders which have been used as a source of electricity. Theworking fluidwas HFE 7100 – a newly engineered fluid with a unique heat transfer and favourable environmental properties. In the ORC system three heat exchangers were used (evaporator, regenerator, condenser) and before expanders the <b>droplet</b> <b>separator</b> was installed. As a source of heat an innovative biomass boiler was used. Studies have been carried out for the expanders worked in series and in parallel.

The characteristics of output electrical power, operating speed and vibrations for scroll expanders were also presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Steam {{generator}} tube ruptures (SGTR) with a concurrent stuck open {{safety relief}} valve are counted among the risk dominant accident sequences {{because of the potential}} for radioactive products to bypass the containment. Owing to the absence of relevant empirical data and the complexity of the geometry and controlling processes, the aerosol removal in the steam generator (SG) tubes and in the secondary side is not well understood. Therefore, little or no credit is usually taken for aerosol retention due to natural processes in the various components of a SG. To help reduce the uncertainties associated with fission product release following an SGTR sequence, the Paul Scherrer Institut has initiated an international experimental project to be performed in the ARTIST (AeRosol Trapping In a Steam generaTor) facility in the time period from 2002 to 2007. The ARTIST test section is a scaled model of a real SG, and is comprised of a 264 -tube bundle with a maximum height of 3. 8 m, as well as one full-size <b>droplet</b> <b>separator</b> and one full-size steam dryer. The ARTIST facility is capable of producing soluble and insoluble aerosols and entrain them at sonic gas flow rates (up to 0. 25 kg/s, thus matching comparable values predicted by the codes. In addition, aerosols can be generated at prototypical concentrations (up to 5 g/m 3) an...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} a catastrophic free nuclear reactor, the {{stability}} of the nuclear reactor must be guaranteed also in case of hypothetical accidents, that the consequences are limited to the power plant by self-acting mechanisms. In this paper, the inherent safety properties of the High-Temperature-Reactor (HTR) against water ingress accidents will be explained. The water ingress in the primary cycle of a HTR by a leakage of the steam generator is an accident, involving {{the stability of}} the reactor in two points. The additional moderation of neutrons by water molecules leads to reactivity effects. Further the fuel elements may be corroded leading to a formation of water gas. In case of a small leakage in the steam generator liquid water is injected in the primary circuit in form of small droplets, which can be transported by the gas flow into the core. The amount of water within the core is mainly dependant on the reactor protection system, the flow conditions in the primary circuit and the droplet size. Hypothetical accident scenarios will be defined in a first step considering the behaviour of the reactor protection system. In the second step, calculations to the formation of drops and the behaviour of the blower-unit under accident condition are done. Thereafter analytical and numerical calculation models for the transport and the separation of droplets will be developed. The calculation results will be validated with measurement results for the inertial separation of water droplets from an air flow. Furthermore analytical models to transfer the result to several conditions during the accident are described. Based on the transfer models the efficiency of the droplet separation in the primary circuit of a HTR is estimated in the experimental facility SEAT. The SEAT facility consists of a flow channel with integrated measurement for determining droplet sizes. It will be shown, that the installation of additional droplet separators in the primary circuit is useful with respect to the duration of the accident and drying the primary circuit alter the accident. In this context the separation efficiency is tested with différent types of separators in single or series arrangements. Finally a self-acting safety element is suggested, which consists of a <b>droplet</b> <b>separator</b> and a float arrangement for strongly reducing the duration ofthe accident...|$|E
40|$|Mist eliminators (also called <b>droplet</b> eliminators, <b>droplet</b> <b>separators</b> or demisters) are {{devices that}} can remove liquid {{droplets}} from a gas flow. The gas flow laden with droplets {{is forced to}} pass through different channels, changing direction in a repetitive manner. Wave-plate (or vane type) eliminator are widely employed in chemical and industrial processes involving gas and vapour flows where mist removal is necessary for several reasons. For instance, {{one of the most}} important objectives is to restrict pollutant emission into the environment, as in cooling towers applications. Wave-plate mist eliminators can operate in vertical and horizontal situations, but in both cases, the removal of liquid droplets occurs mainly by inertial impaction. In cooling towers, spraying water is distributed over a heat transfer surface across or through which a stream of air is passing. Thus, water droplets can be captured by the stream of air and they will be carried out of the system. This phenomenon is known as drift. In countries with warm climate, inside the cooling towers the conditions of high temperature and humidity can strongly induce the spreading of pathogens agents, especially the Legionella pneumophila. The main disadvantage of installing mist (i. e., drift) eliminators is an increased pressure loss of the airflow. High-pressure loss contributes to lower flow rate of air or higher engine power of the ventilators. This fact leads to obtain lower overall efficiency values for the air-conditioning systems. Since a lack of systematic studies on comparative evaluation of morphologically similar separators has been detected, the behaviour of four wave-type eliminators having a similar geometry is studied. Both droplet collection efficiency and the pressure drop coefficient are calculated. Special emphasis is made on the validation of the numerical model with results taken from the literature, the study of the effects of relevant parameters, and the achievement of a procedure to evaluate the overall efficiency of each regarded type of eliminator. The obtained results may contribute to improve the passive droplets restraint systems in mechanical cooling towers, increasing the overall operation of the cooling tower on one side, and lowering their environmental impact on the other...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakup of}} crude oil {{emulsions}} to produce clean oil and water phases is an important task in crude oil processing. We have investigated the demulsification kinetics of a model oil-in-water emulsion in a centrifugal field to mimic the forces acting on emulsion <b>droplets</b> in oil/water <b>separators</b> such as hydrocyclones. The {{rate of growth of}} separated oil phase and the change in mean droplet diameter of the emulsion layer was measured as a function of surfactant concentration, centrifugal acceleration and time. Demulsification is enhanced with increasing centrifugal acceleration and time and decreasing surfactant concentration. A kinetic analysis was performed that allows to estimate the characteristic coalescence times between droplets in the emulsion and between a droplet and the separated oil interface. The experimental procedure presented in this work can serve as a simple, but useful test to predict the separation efficiency of emulsions in separators with swirling flow fields...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} turbulent flow of air with dispersed water <b>droplets</b> in <b>separators</b> of mechanical cooling towers. The averaged Navier-Stokes equations are discretised through a finite volume method, using the Fluent and Phoenics codes, and alternatively employing the turbulence models k−ϵ, k−ω and the Reynolds stress model, with low-Re version and wall enhanced treatment refinements. The results obtained are compared with numerical and experimental results taken from the literature. The degree of accuracy obtained {{with each of the}} considered models of turbulence is stated. The influence of considering whether or not the simulation of the turbulent dispersion of droplets is analyzed, as well as the effects of other relevant parameters on the collection efficiency and the coefficient of pressure drop. Focusing on four specific eliminators (‘Belgian wave’, ‘H 1 -V’, ‘L-shaped’ and ‘Zig-zag’), the following ranges of parameters are outlined: 1 ≤Ue≤ 5 m/s for the entrance velocity, 2 ≤Dp≤ 50 μm for the droplet diameter, 650 ≤Re≤ 8. 500 for Reynolds number, and 0. 05 ≤Pi≤ 5 for the inertial parameter. Results reached alternately with Fluent and Phoenics codes are compared. The best results correspond to the simulations performed with Fluent, using the SST k−ω turbulence model, with values of the dimensionless scaled distance to wall y+ in the range 0. 2 to 0. 5. Finally, correlations are presented to predict the conditions for maximum collection efficiency (100 %), depending on the geometric parameter of removal efficiency of each of the separators, which is introduced in this work...|$|R
