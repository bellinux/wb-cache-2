5000|$|According to Rahner, {{human beings}} are created to be {{oriented}} towards the incomprehensible Mystery called God. However, this human orientation towards the Mystery can be fully grasped only if we as humans freely choose to be grasped by the incomprehensible One: if God assumes human nature as God's own reality with God's <b>irrevocable</b> <b>offer</b> of God's self-communication, and a person freely accepts it, the person is united with God, reaching the very point towards which humanity is always moving {{by virtue of its}} essence, a God-Man which is fully fulfilled in the person of Jesus of Nazareth claimed by Christian faith. In this sense, Rahner sees the incarnation of God as [...] "the unique and highest instance of the actualization of the essence of human reality" [...] (Rahner, p. 218).|$|E

We say that the sign is a complex reality as defined {{from the perspective of a}} triple reporting: the reporting system which includes (grammar), by reference to the referent (object of view gnosiological - semantics), in relation to the user (pragmatic). Currently, semiotics demonstrates that we are in a position to know and be able to explain the genesis and meaning of signs and symbols, of semiotics. Attempts topology signs are related either to the nature of entities expressing (graphics, reports, images, or their functionality and purpose). Culture generally includes semiotic triangle (archaic → modern →tradition) as an expression of one and multiple stored value and resized, preserving creative vein even multiplied by re (potential) value. These points in time are compressed symbolic triggers symbolic codes that existed outside of history and the history that re <b>irrevocable</b> <b>offer</b> (reading) them. This process involves scenarios from our intuitive semiotic-hermeneutical, logical mind that we can find versions of relational and interpretative signs and symbols as a formula for coherence resonance and cultures...|$|E

Despite this, many researchers are convinced of the vital role that technologies can play in learning and teaching. Student Reactions to Learning with Technologies: Perceptions and Outcomes brings together recent research findings about the views and expectations of students when including technologies in their studies. The chapters in this book suggest {{that the use of}} technologies in teaching not only makes learning more interesting but also offers possibilities for variations in the learning processes. While this book does not <b>offer</b> <b>irrevocable</b> opinions and definitive views or insights, it provides a useful lens for viewing the world of students and providing insights into the possibilities for accessing and conducting similar research...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between standardization processes, {{intellectual property rights}} and competition rules has increasingly become {{of interest in the}} recent years. Recent investigations of the European Commission confirm that standardization processes and in particular ownership of IPRs that cover standardized technology might in certain circumstances infringe competition rules. The article first explores the meaning and different forms of standardization. It then analyses selected parts of the Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-operation agreements, in particular those parts that cover standardisation agreements. The Guidelines have been adopted by the Commission in December 2010 with a view to addressing the anti-competitive concerns stemming from inter alia standardisation agreements (eg, they encourage IPRs holders to disclose their exclusive rights before the adoption of the standard, as well as to give an <b>irrevocable</b> commitment to <b>offer</b> to license the IPR to all parties interested on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms: so-called FRAND commitment). The author will then present and comment on different points of view on whether the ownership of IPRs which cover standardized technologies really create market dominance capable of triggering anti-competitive behaviours. Finally, a set of additional solutions proposed by various legal scholars will be highlighted and commented...|$|R
