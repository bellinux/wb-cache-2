50|$|An <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> {{connected}} to a capacitor system can generate sufficient reactive power to operate on its own. When the load current exceeds the capability of the generator to supply both magnetization reactive power and load power the generator will immediately cease to produce power. The load must be removed and the <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> restarted with either a DC source, or if present, residual magnetism in the core.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the wind}} power {{generation}} has attracted special interest and many wind ower stations are being in {{service in the}} world. In the wind power stations, in addition to normal induction machines, machines with special rotor structure, as double squirrel-cage rotor and deep-bar rotor <b>induction</b> <b>generators,</b> are also used as a generator. This paper presents a model of <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> with special rotor structure, develops methods of power flow calculation and transient stability simulation of power system including the <b>induction</b> <b>generators,</b> and presents considerations {{on the characteristics of}} transient stability of the <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> on the basis of numerical simulations. This paper also presents considerations on the effect of pitch control system of wind turbine on the transient stability of <b>induction</b> <b>generators...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> are {{particularly}} suitable for wind generating stations {{as in this}} case speed is always a variable factor. Unlike synchronous motors, <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> are load-dependent and cannot be used alone for grid frequency control.|$|R
50|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> {{are often}} used in wind {{turbines}} and some micro hydro installations due {{to their ability to}} produce useful power at varying rotor speeds. <b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> are mechanically and electrically simpler than other generator types. They are also more rugged, requiring no brushes or commutators.|$|R
5000|$|In an <b>induction</b> <b>generator,</b> the stater {{magnetic}} flux induces currents in the rotor. The prime mover then drives the rotor above the synchronous speed, causing the opposing rotor flux {{to cut the}} stater coils producing active current in the stater coils, thus sending power back to the electrical grid. An <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> draws reactive power from the connected system and so cannot be an isolated source of power.|$|E
50|$|DFIG for Double Fed <b>Induction</b> <b>Generator,</b> a {{generating}} principle {{widely used}} in wind turbines. It {{is based on an}} <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> with a multiphase wound rotor and a multiphase slip ring assembly with brushes for access to the rotor windings. It is possible to avoid the multiphase slip ring assembly (see brushless doubly-fed electric machines), but there are problems with efficiency, cost and size. A better alternative is a brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine.|$|E
50|$|If an {{induction}} motor {{is connected to}} a capacitor and the shaft turns above synchronous speed, it operates as a self-excited <b>induction</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
30|$|Early wind {{turbines}} based on conventional <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> are normally only {{required to keep}} a good power factor, which is accomplished by switching capacitor banks or other reactive power compensation devices, such as SVC. Many modern wind generators have power electronic systems as grid interfaces, such as doubly-fed <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> (DFIG) or full rate power electronic interfaced <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> and synchronous generators. The power electronic systems can provide dynamic reactive power control. If more and flexible reactive power capacity is required, additional reactive power compensation systems, such as SVC and STATCOM, {{should be used to}} provide voltage support in both steady state and dynamic/transient state.|$|R
40|$|Vast use {{of fossil}} fuels is leading to energy deficiency. Hence the {{renewable}} energy sources like wind energy and solar energy are being used. Classical asynchronous <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> are being used in wind energy based power generation system. In markets of micro electric energy generation unit system, <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> are getting popularized, as it is cheap, robust and maintenance free. But generally induction machines are used as motor, hence the catalogues have only information about motoring mode. This report gives a comparative analysis between motoring and generating mode of induction machines. From this report we conclude that the induction motors have more efficiency and less losses than <b>induction</b> <b>generators...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{induction}} motor {{can be used}} as an <b>induction</b> <b>generator,</b> or it can be unrolled to form a linear {{induction motor}} which can directly generate linear motion.|$|E
50|$|To operate, an <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> must {{be excited}} with a leading voltage; {{this is usually}} done by {{connection}} to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are self-excited by using phase correcting capacitors.|$|E

A productivity comparison is performed between the selected wind turbine systems including reliability issues. Two methods of modification for variable-speed wind turbines with Doubly Fed <b>Induction</b> <b>Generators</b> (DFIG) to improve their availability are finally suggested. ...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> usually draws its {{excitation}} power from an electrical grid; sometimes, however, they are self-excited by using phase-correcting capacitors. Because of this, induction generators cannot usually [...] "black start" [...] a de-energized distribution system.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons of {{transient}} voltage stability characteristics between <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> and <b>induction</b> motors are conducted. In correspondence {{with that of}} the induction motors, {{transient voltage}} stability criterions and stability margin definition for <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> are proposed. The impacts on transient voltage stability of both node voltage and rotor speed are comprehensively considered. A multi-criteria assessment process is designed to speed up the evaluation for the cases far away from the critical condition, and to ensure the accuracy for the cases close to the critical condition. Sensitivity analysis is performed based on the fault critical clearing time obtained through trial-and-error based on full scale time domain simulations. The results prove the accuracy of using the proposed criterion and margin index to reflect the degree of <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> voltage stabilit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> are {{particularly}} suitable for small hydro applications and {{are widely used}} at present. However, with conventional grid-connected techniques, {{it is not always}} possible to use them in regions with weak grids because of excessive connection transients. Consequently, their many advantages cannot be fully exploited in these regions. Standardised control systems have been developed by ECS for isolated applications of <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> and these will now be further developed to permit reduced-transient grid connections...|$|R

50|$|An <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> always {{operates}} at the grid frequency irrespective of its rotation speed; {{all that is}} necessary {{is to ensure that}} it is driven by the turbine faster than the synchronous speed so that it generates power rather than consuming it.

50|$|Some AC motors {{may be used}} as generators, turning {{mechanical}} energy into electric current. <b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC asynchronous motor usually {{can be used as a}} generator, without any internal modifications. <b>Induction</b> <b>generators</b> are useful in applications such as minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls.|$|R

50|$|In {{renewable}} energy systems, frequency converters are {{an essential component}} of doubly fed <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> (DFIGs) as used in modern multi-megawatt class wind turbines.|$|R
50|$|The {{generator}} in a {{wind turbine}} produces alternating current (AC) electricity. Some turbines drive an AC/AC converter—which converts the AC to direct current (DC) with a rectifier {{and then back}} to AC with an inverter—in order to match the frequency and phase of the grid. However, the most common method in large modern turbines is to instead use a doubly fed <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> directly connected to the electricity grid.|$|E
50|$|Already in the mid-1990s, the D4 was {{produced}} with active pitch regulation {{as well as}} a doubly fed <b>induction</b> <b>generator.</b> This technology proved itself and, therefore, was implemented in the following models D6 and D8. Especially advantageous are the decoupling of the rotational speed of the turbine rotor and the grid frequency. By using the inertia of the turbine rotor, it reduces mechanical loads on turbine components and prevents peaks in electricity feed-in.|$|E
50|$|A fully rated {{converter}} {{can either}} be an <b>induction</b> <b>generator</b> or a permanent magnet generator. Unlike the DFIG, the FRC can employ {{a squirrel cage rotor}} in the generator; an example of this is the Siemens SWT 3.6-107, which is termed the industry workhorse. An example of a permanent magnet generator is the Siemens SWT-2.3-113. A disadvantage of a permanent magnet generator is the cost of materials that need to be included.|$|E

In order to maximise the benefits from EG, it is expected that islanding operation will be allowed in the future. This paper discusses the dynamic behaviour of <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> (widely used in EG) connected directly to the grid, during disconnection and reconnection to the grid. Direct connection of <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> is used in EG, such as micro CHP and some wind turbines. Results showed that self-excited <b>induction</b> <b>generators</b> experience a serious voltage regulation problem when the load and speed change.
