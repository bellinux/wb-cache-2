5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take.</b> <b>The</b> directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013 the Government {{estimated}} {{the total cost}} of the rebuild would be as much as $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion. Some economists have estimated <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand economy 50 to 100 years to completely recover. The earthquake was the most damaging in a year-long earthquake swarm affecting the Christchurch area. It was followed by a large aftershock on 13 June (which caused considerable additional damage) and a series of large shocks on 23 December 2011.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the European Union {{passed a}} law banning the {{promotion}} of imported seal products. The law {{was approved by the}} Council of the European Union without debate on July 27, 2009. Denmark, Romania, and Austria abstained. The Canadian government responded to the move by stating that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> European Union to the World Trade Organization if the ban does not exempt Canada. Canadian Inuit from the territory of Nunavut have opposed the ban and lobbied European Parliament members against it. Canadian seal hunting issues had been spotlighted {{in the months leading up}} to the 2010 Winter Olympics which were held in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The Sprinter fleet that EMT {{inherited}} at {{the start}} of the franchise was in a very poor state. Problems ranged from basic and simple to major complicated faults. The fleet was put together from various sources - around four different previous companies, with some coming directly from passenger work but some that had been lying idle surplus to requirements off lease in sidings. East Midlands Trains has claimed that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> lifetime of the franchise to get the trains to a standard that it is happy with. In addition to the various sources of the trains, passenger figures given to the Department for Transport prior to the franchise were incorrect, leading to a shortfall in the number of seats provided (a 26% decrease in capacity on route 2) compared with what was required.|$|E

[...] His resources were so great and his willingness to help was always to be relied upon. [...] Cairo has won a great reputation as a host, but it was because she had a Capt. Halliday. [...] When there was any entertainment of distinguished guests to be planned, it was done on a magnificent scale because Capt. Halliday’s purse was drawn upon for such {{a large part of the}} bill.

500|$|For instance, {{recall the}} {{one-dimensional}} cellular automaton {{defined as an}} example from a rectangular band, in which the cell states are pairs of values (l,r) drawn from sets [...] and [...] of left values and right values, the left value of each cell moves rightwards at each time step, and the right value of each cell moves leftwards. In this case, for each left or right value [...] of the band, one can define a conserved quantity, {{the total number of}} cells that have that value. If there are [...] left values and [...] right values, then there are [...] independent first-order-invariants, and any first-order invariant can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental ones. The conserved quantities associated with left values flow uniformly to the right at a constant rate: that is, if the number of left values equal to [...] within some region [...] of the line takes a certain value at time , then <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> same value for the shifted region [...] at time [...] Similarly, the conserved quantities associated with right values flow uniformly to the left.|$|E

60|$|The ark is {{one hundred}} and forty feet long; the {{dwelling}} is ninety feet long. The idea of the Indians is to drop softly and secretly from the arched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it {{at the rate of}} a mile an hour, and butcher the family. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ark {{a minute and a half}} to pass under. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ninety foot dwelling a minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six Indians do? It would take you thirty years to guess, and even then you would have to give it up, I believe. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians did. Their chief, a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a Cooper Indian, warily watched the canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when he had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade, as he judged, he let go and dropped. And missed the house! That is actually what he did. He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the scow. It was not much of a fall, yet it knocked him silly. He lay there unconscious. If the house had been ninety-seven feet long he would have made the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The error lay in the construction of the house. Cooper was no architect.|$|E
