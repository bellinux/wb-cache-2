The S content and the protein content were generally low. S fertilisation improved the yield and protein content of red clover only when the initial <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> was very low.

40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} lead and sulfur accumulation in paddy soils in parts of southern China. A combined soil sand pot experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> on iron plaque formation and Pb accumulation in rice (Oryza saliva L.) under two Pb levels (0 and 600 mg kg(- 1)), combined with four S concentrations (0, 30, 60, and 120 mg kg(- 1)). Results showed that <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> significantly decreased Pb accumulation in straw and grains of rice. This result {{may be attributed to}} the enhancement of Fe plaque formation, decrease of Pb availability in soil, and increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) in rice leaves. Moderate <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> (30 mg kg(- 1)) significantly increased Fe plaque formation on the root surface and in the rhizosphere, whereas excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> (60 and 120 mg kg(- 1)) significantly decreased the amounts of iron plaque on the root surface. Sulfur supply significantly enhanced the GSH contents in leaves of rice plants under Pb treatment. With excessive S application, the rice root acted as a more effective barrier to Pb accumulation compared with iron plaque. Excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> may result in a higher monosulfide toxicity and decreased iron plaque formation on the root surface during flooded conditions. However, excessive <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> could effectively decrease Pb availability in soils and reduce Pb accumulation in rice plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{breeding}} {{process can}} be facilitated if sulfur efficiency in canola at maturity can be reliably determined by screening germplasm in the vegetative stage. Twelve canola genotypes chosen fromapreliminary screening studywith either high or lowSefficiency indiceswere tested for consistency inS efficiencybetweenvegetative stage andmaturity. Plantswere grown under glasshouse conditions using low or adequate <b>S</b> <b>supply.</b> The criteria for efficiency assessment at the vegetative stage were: shoot biomass at deficient <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> relative biomass production, and S utilisation efficiency. Considering these three criteria of S efficiency, only one canola genotype was classified as efficient (Surpass 402 CL). Three genotypes were classified as inefficient under two criteria: genotypes IB 1337 and Surpass 300 TT for relative biomass production at low <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> and S-utilisation efficiency, and IB 1368 for biomass production and relative biomass production. In addition to seed yield, relative seed yield, and S utilisation, four additional efficiency criteria were used for thematurity stage: harvest index, S harvest index, and oil and protein concentrations in the seed. For all efficiency criteria used, highly significant genotypic differences existed. IB 1368 was ranked efficient under all criteria. Genotypes Surpass 402 CL and 46 C 74 were ranked inefficient atmaturity but efficient at the vegetative stage. In conclusion, screening canola germplasm for S efficiency requires {{an assessment of the}} efficiency at maturity rather than during vegetative growth...|$|R

40|$|Both Fe {{deficiency}} and Cd exposure induce {{rapid changes}} in the S nutritional requirement of plants. The aim of this work was to characterize the strategies adopted by plants to cope with both Fe deficiency (release of phytosiderophores) and Cd contamination [production of glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins] when grown under conditions of limited <b>S</b> <b>supply.</b> Experiments were performed in hydroponics, using barley plants grown under S sufficiency (1. 2 mM sulphate) and S deficiency (0 mM sulphate), with or without Fe III-EDTA at 0. 08 mM for 11 d and subsequently exposed to 0. 05 mM Cd for 24 h or 72 h. In S-sufficient plants, Fe deficiency enhanced both root and shoot Cd concentrations and increased GSH and phytochelatin levels. In S-deficient plants, Fe starvation caused {{a slight increase in}} Cd concentration, but this change was accompanied neither by an increase in GSH nor by an accumulation of phytochelatins. Release of phytosiderophores, only detectable in Fe-deficient plants, was strongly decreased by S deficiency and further reduced after Cd treatment. In roots Cd exposure increased the expression of the high affinity sulphate transporter gene (HvST 1) regardless of the <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> and the expression of the Fe deficiency-responsive genes, HvYS 1 and HvIDS 2, irrespective of Fe supply. In conclusion, adequate S availability is necessary to cope with Fe deficiency and Cd toxicity in barley plants. Moreover, it appears that in Fe-deficient plants grown in the presence of Cd with limited <b>S</b> <b>supply,</b> sulphur may be preferentially employed in the pathway for biosynthesis of phytosiderophores, rather than for phytochelatin production...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} in {{biological}} science that all factors applied to living organisms (light, water, warmth, fertilizers etc.) show an optimum, when their input is increased. Healthy organisms and sus-tainable systems are, on the long run, only achieved when care is taken not to destroy this equilibrium of factors producing an optimum. With regard to the baking quality of wheat breeders and cereal scientists obviously failed to achieve this aim by breeding their cultivars on the background of ample S depositions in the ecosystems. They (involuntarily) selected plants showing definite characteristics of S deficiency (higher proportions of HMW-glutenin, stronger gluten and dough) even under conditions of ample <b>S</b> <b>supply.</b> I suppose they also selected plants with a high warmth susceptibility as this also delivers firm protein structure. When this environ-mental pollution was stopped and <b>S</b> <b>supplies</b> returned to natural conditions, even with a non S craving plant like wheat, problems arose with the gluten structure as doughs turned out so strong that the baking volume decreased.

40|$|Nicotianamine is an {{essential}} molecule for Fe homeostasis in plants, its primary precursor is the S-containing compound methionine, and it is biosynthesized by the enzyme family of nicotianamine synthases. In maize, a graminaceous plant that follows Strategy II for Fe uptake, ZmNAS genes can be subgrouped into two classes, according to their roles and tissue specific expression profiles. In roots, the genes of class I provide NA {{for the production of}} deoxymugineic acid, which is secreted to the rhizosphere and chelates Fe(III). The Fe(III) -DMA complex is then inserted to the root via a ZmYS 1 transporter. The genes of class II provide NA for local translocation and detoxification of Fe in the leaves. Due to the connection between S and Fe homeostasis, S deficiency causes Fe deprivation responses to graminaceous plants and when <b>S</b> is <b>supplied,</b> these responses are inverted. In this study, maize plants were grown in pots with sterile river sand containing FePO 4 and were inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. The plants were grown under S deficient conditions until day 60 from sowing and on that day sulfate was provided to the plants. In order {{to assess the impact of}} AM symbiosis on Fe homeostasis, the expression patterns of ZmNAS 1, ZmNAS 3 (representatives of ZmNAS class I and class II) and ZmYS 1 were monitored before and after <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> by means of real time RT-PCR and they were used as indicators of the plant Fe status.

The synthesis and accumulation of GSPs depend highly on nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) availability and {{it is important to understand}} the underlying control mechanisms. Here we studied how the einkorn (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum) grain proteome responds to different amounts of N and <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> during grain development. GSP composition at grain maturity was clearly impacted by nutrition treatments, due to early changes in the rate of GSP accumulation during grain filling. Large-scale analysis of the nuclear and albumin-globulin sub-proteomes during this key developmental phase revealed that the abundance of 203 proteins was significantly modified by the nutrition treatments. Our results showed that the grain proteome was highly impacted by perturbation in the N:S balance. <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> strongly increased the rate of accumulation of S-rich α/β-gliadin and γ-gliadin, and the abundance of several other proteins involved in glutathione metabolism. Post-anthesis N supply resulted in the activation of amino acid metabolism at the expense of carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of transport processes including nucleocytoplasmic transit. Protein accumulation networks were analyzed. Several central actors in the response were identified whose variation in abundance was related to variation in the amounts of many other proteins and are thus potentially important for GSP accumulation. This detailed analysis of grain sub-proteomes provides information on how wheat GSP composition can possibly be controlled in low-level fertilization condition...|$|R

The concentrations of glutathione and glucosinolates increased from the oldest to the youngest leaves, whereas the opposite was observed for SO 42 −. The concentration of insoluble S was similar among all of the leaves. At sufficient <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> and in the youngest leaves, 2 % of total S was allocated to glutathione, 6 % to glucosinolates, 50 % to the insoluble fraction, and the remainder accumulated as SO 42 −.

Nitrogen and sulphur had a clear interactive effect on the yield of all plant parts with little or no effect of S at low N application rates and similar low effect of N without S application. The sulphate concentration in the different plant parts was markedly affected by the S application rate. This effect was most pronounced in leaves, less in stems and least in ears. In S-replete plants leaf S decreased during grain development by an average of 28 %, while in S-deficient plants the leaf S content did not change during the grain-filling period. About 70 % of leaf N was redistributed to the ears in plants growing at adequate <b>S</b> <b>supply</b> compared with about 35 % of leaf N in S-deficient plants.
