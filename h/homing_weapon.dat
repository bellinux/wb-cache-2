50|$|Players {{also can}} pick up a weapon {{attachment}} that increases weapon strength and ability depending on the jet known as the S-Unit. The S-Unit can charge its strength and ultimately change its attack pattern when the players use the manual five-speed option whereupon reaching the jet's highest gear, the weapon will temporarily change to a <b>homing</b> <b>weapon</b> known as H-Unit mode. However, the S-Unit attachment can be removed and thus detonated once players hit the Bomb button.|$|E
40|$|Approved lot public release; {{distribution}} unlimited. LEXINGTON MASSACHUSETTS [...] . i i [...] . I 1 [...] . A {{general description}} is given {{of the computer}} program which simulates the performance of an anti-radiation <b>homing</b> <b>weapon</b> {{taking into account the}} properties of the seeker, assumed to be body-referenced, and the air vehicle. For the purpose of illustration, sample calculations have assumed a minidrone as the air vehicle, although the simulation has a wide range of applications to a variety of platforms. The program can simulate terminal homing in the situations where ultiple, co-channel CW emitters are deployed. The three constituent simulation blocks (signal in space, seeker, and tactical vehicle) are discussed in detail, as well as models for sensor errors and wind effects...|$|E
50|$|Anti-aircraft weapons, {{known as}} man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), are small surface-to-air missiles. They are {{typically}} infrared <b>homing</b> <b>weapons</b> {{and used to}} target helicopters and other low-flying aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The A-10 {{was one of}} the {{selectable}} {{aircraft in}} the Nintendo 64 game Aerofighters Assault, piloted by the female pilot Glenda. It was unique as in being the only aircraft in campaign mode with no <b>homing</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s the Royal Navy was {{equipped}} with British designed and built Mk 30 air-dropped torpedoes. These were passive <b>homing</b> <b>weapons</b> which relied on detecting the noise from submarine targets. However, as submarine noise levels decreased these weapons became ineffective. A design for a British Mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo-location sonar failed to receive Government approval for production. US Mk 44 torpedoes were purchased for the Royal Navy in the 1960s to fill this role, and later replaced by US Mk 46 torpedoes.|$|R
5000|$|DST92 Length 11 m. Weight 4,750 kg. Warhead 557 kg. Wake <b>homing</b> anti-ship <b>weapon.</b> Operates at 20 m depth. Sensor points upwards {{to detect}} the ships wake, the torpedo sweeps {{from side to side}} to find the edges of the wake.|$|R
2500|$|The Sega CD {{enhanced}} port {{was also}} well received. GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that whereas most Sega CD ports simply add enhanced music, Earthworm Jim included {{a number of}} worthwhile additions such as new animations, new levels, and the new <b>homing</b> missile <b>weapon.</b> EGM gave it their [...] "Game of the Month" [...] award, and GamePro later awarded it Best Sega CD Game of 1995.|$|R
50|$|The bomb {{can use a}} GPS/INS {{system to}} guide itself into the general {{vicinity}} of a moving target during the initial search phase, with course correction updates provided using a Link 16 over UHF data link. The bomb has three modes of target acquisition: millimeter-wave radar, infrared homing using an uncooled imaging seeker, and semi-active laser <b>homing.</b> The <b>weapon</b> is capable of fusing {{the information from the}} sensors to classify the target and can prioritize certain types of targets as desired when used in semi-autonomous mode.|$|R
50|$|Several weapons, when {{additionally}} upgraded, {{turn into}} a super weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple {{for a short period}} of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of option seeds, which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term <b>homing</b> beam <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Five power-ups {{exist in}} the game. The Vulcan flame cannon, crystal-pulse laser, and CHAOS (<b>homing)</b> {{missiles}} are <b>weapon</b> upgrades. There are also speed upgrades and plasma droids, invincible pods which will flank the ship. The plasma droids can absorb enemy pellets and will even damage enemies they come into contact with.|$|R
40|$|The {{solution}} of the task of signal allocation at the prevailing background noise in telecommunication and radar systems is carried out as an optimization problem, which increases the probability of correct detection and minimizes the probability of false alarm. In some application tasks such as finding people who have experienced a disaster using emergency buoys, markers identify angular position measurement using <b>homing</b> <b>weapons,</b> nuclear material fixation disguised as natural background optimization of environmental monitoring systems, {{it is necessary to}} allocate a tone around the obstacles that exceeds the mentioned in many times. The mathematical description of the dominant background is a system of two and a greater number of random variables that are completely determined by the initial moments of the first and second order and mixed (correlation) point. As far as all random parameters determining the background is not correlated, the correlation matrix equals to a constant. When the source of low tone values of the correlation matrix has been growing, and the degree of this increase is proportional to the number of performed measurements. Mathematical model of detection tone in terms of the dominant noise gating is the process of narrowband measurements, calculate each band correlation matrix for the family implementations, further comparison of the calculated matrix and regulatory decision presence of radiation sources with significant differences. ??????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?? ???? ???????????? ????? ? ???????????????????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??? ??????????????? ??????, ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????. ? ???? ?????????? ?????, ????? ??? ????? ?????, ??????????? ????????, ? ??????? ????????? ????, ????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????, ???????? ???????? ?????????, ???????????????? ??? ???????????? ???, ??????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????. ?????????????? ???????? ????????????? ???? ???????? ???????? ???? ? ???????? ????? ????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????, ? ????? ?????????

5000|$|On 20 May 2010, a South Korean-led {{international}} commission {{investigating the}} sinking of Cheonan presented its findings, stating that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack.The torpedo parts recovered {{at the site of}} the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May, which include 5x5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. The markings in Hangul, which read [...] "1번" [...] (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo. However, some (The Hankyoreh) have pointed out without the proper reason that in the North, [...] "호" [...] (pronounced [...] "ho") is most often used rather than [...] "번"; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking [...] "4호". Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods. However, an expert at a South Korean missile manufacturer disagreed with the idea that the submarine alleged by ROK authorities to have shot the torpedo actually has the capability: [...] "Sango class submarines are known to be used by North Korean commandos in infiltrating areas or laying mines, but they apparently do not have an advanced system to guide <b>homing</b> <b>weapons.</b> If a smaller class submarine was involved, there is a bigger question mark." ...|$|R
5000|$|Varth {{features}} {{three different}} weapons for the player - a laser (long rate of sustained fire but lowest horizontal range), a shotgun (relatively powerful {{with a potential}} range {{as wide as the}} player's craft), and multi-directional shot (very wide range but lowest sustained rate of fire). Additionally, three different types of pod weapons are available - <b>homing</b> missiles (weakest <b>weapon</b> but with a useful homing advantage), missiles (more damaging than homing missiles but can only fire forward), and napalm (powerful but with very low range). Like 194X games, Varth also features bombs which allow the planes to perform [...] "mega crashes". The type of mega crash a plane can do is determined by the weapon it is carrying. Lasers will result in an electricity attack that will cover the entire screen. The shotgun will fire missiles which will move from target to target. The multi-directional shot will fire a single large burst that moves directly forward from the player, then emanates many smaller bolts on reaching the top of the screen.|$|R
40|$|Camouflage, decoy and {{deception}} techniques {{can play a}} decisive role on the modern battlefield. The rapid advance of surveillance, targeting and <b>weapons</b> <b>homing</b> sensor technology now makes every ele-ment which is detected almost assured of being destroyed. Camouflage, decoy {{and deception}} equipment and techniques are a low cost way to increase survivability and shift this balance by reducing the signa-ture of targets (camouflage), increasing the signature level of the background (clutter), creating false targets (decoy), and distorting the perceived target value (disguise). eL-decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create the perception of noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power, pulsed microwaves. When people are illuminated with properly modulated low power microwaves the sensa-tion is reported as a buzzing, clicking, or hissing which seems to originate (regardless of the person's position in the field) within or just behind the head * 1 - The phenomena occurs at average power densities as low as microwatts per square centimeter with carrier frequencies from 0. 4 to 3. 0 GHz. By proper choice of pulse charac-S teristics, intelligible speech may be created. Before this technique may be extended and used for military applications, an understanding D of the basic principles must be developed. Such an understanding is C [...] .) not only required to optimize {{the use of the}} concept for camouflage, Sdecoy and deception operations but is required to properly assess _j safety factors of such microwave exposure...|$|R
