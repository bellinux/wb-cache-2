25|$|In 1609, King Philip III, {{upon the}} advice of his {{financial}} adviser the Duke of Lerma and Archbishop of Valencia Juan de Ribera, decreed the Expulsion of the Moriscos. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them. The edict required: 'The Moriscos to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange.... <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could carry.' Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson. Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arguing that}} both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards {{international}} broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 {{that it would}} attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now [...] "at war with songwriters," [...] and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to [...] "lawsuits and gimmicks" [...] to make its point. However, a member of Public Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was [...] "a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system {{that is based on}} who wants a license instead of <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to do with the music they’re using." [...] ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent {{to use it as a}} [...] "bargaining chip" [...] for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora [...] "demonstrate adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification." ...|$|E
