Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed <b>homogeneously</b> and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is <b>homogeneously</b> dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled <b>homogeneously</b> and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to hydrocarbons, the stratosphere contains carbon monoxide, {{as well as}} traces of water vapor and carbon dioxide. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide—3—is {{very similar to that}} of the hydrocarbons, while the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and water are about 10−11 and 8, respectively. These three compounds are distributed relatively <b>homogeneously</b> in the stratosphere and are not confined to a narrow layer like hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|An MLCC {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual capacitors stacked together in parallel and contacted via the terminal surfaces. The starting material for all MLCC chips is a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric raw materials, modified by accurately determined additives.

25|$|Compared to {{the other}} states of matter, gases have low density and viscosity. Pressure and {{temperature}} influence the particles within a certain volume. This variation in particle separation and speed {{is referred to as}} compressibility. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as {{can be found in the}} following list of refractive indices. Finally, gas particles spread apart or diffuse in order to <b>homogeneously</b> distribute themselves throughout any container.|$|E
25|$|In McOndo narratives, {{cities and}} city life are realistically portrayed as places and {{circumstances}} rendered virtual ("non-places") by the technologies of the Internet, cellular telephones, and cable television; virtual space has supplanted physical {{space in the}} city. To wit, the writer Ana María Amar Sánchez said that cities have become interchangeable, <b>homogeneously</b> indistinguishable from each other, especially when seen from a distance, whilst riding in a speeding automobile travelling a highway {{en route to a}} shopping center; seen so, the city appears virtual, an image in the screen of a computer or a television set.|$|E
25|$|The mean oceanic {{mixing time}} {{is thought to}} be {{approximately}} 1,600 years. If a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean, on average, longer than the oceanic mixing time, then that element is assumed to be <b>homogeneously</b> spread throughout the ocean. As a result, because the major salts have a residence time that is longer than 1,600 years, the ratio of major salts {{is thought to be}} unchanging across the ocean. This constant ratio {{is often referred to as}} Forchhammer's principle or the principle of constant proportions.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are <b>homogeneously</b> mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E
25|$|An {{inertial}} frame of reference, in classical physics, is {{a frame of}} reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space <b>homogeneously,</b> isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an {{inertial frame}} have no causes external to the system. An inertial frame of reference may also be called an inertial reference frame, inertial frame, Galilean reference frame, or inertial space.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, pottery {{from the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance often retains a {{distinct}} gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter. This luster {{is caused by}} a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a glazing, which contains silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed <b>homogeneously</b> in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding copper and silver salts and oxides together with vinegar, ochre, and clay on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the Muslim world. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the terms}} 'Muslim world' and 'Islamic world' are disputed, since no country is <b>homogeneously</b> Muslim, {{and there is}} no way to {{determine}} at what point a Muslim minority in a country is to be considered 'significant' enough, there is no consensus on how to define the Muslim world geographically. The only rule of thumb for inclusion which has some support, is that countries need to have a Muslim population of more than 50%. Jones (2005) defines a 'large minority' as being between 30% and 50%; thus, there were nine countries with a 'large Muslim minority' in 2000, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Nigeria, and Tanzania.|$|E
25|$|Another large {{component}} of the remodelling process is the disconnection of branched vessels, which then migrate to distal areas in order to supply blood <b>homogeneously.</b> Branching morphogenesis {{has been found to}} follow the dielectric breakdown model, in that only the vessels with sufficient flow will enlarge, while others will close off. At locations inside the vessel where two tube split off from one, one arm of the split is likely to close, detach, and migrate towards the venous line, where it will re-attach. The result of the closure of a branch is that flow increases and becomes less turbulent in the main line, while blood also begins to flow towards areas which are lacking. Which branch will close depends on the flow rate, direction, and branching angle; in general, a branching angle of 75° or more will necessitate the closing of the smaller branch.|$|E
25|$|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do {{not occur}} <b>homogeneously</b> across the human genome. In fact, there is {{enormous}} diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.|$|E
500|$|Fruitbodies of Stropharia caerulea form mycelial cords–rootlike {{structures}} {{consisting of}} a dense mass of hyphae–which create extensive underground networks that move nutrients and allow the fungus to [...] "forage" [...] for resources. These cords are often associated with stems and rhizomes of the common nettle (Urtica dioica). These mycelial systems' development and the species's interactions with other cord-forming wood decomposer basidiomycetes have been investigated. The mycelia of Stropharia caerulea form a fractal structure characterized by a dense, relatively slowly extending front, a formation associated with finding relatively <b>homogeneously</b> distributed nutrients–equivalent to short-range foraging. An increase in the supply of soil nitrogen or phosphorus increases the fractal branching of the mycelia, allowing increased uptake of nutrients.|$|E
500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a <b>homogeneously</b> erodible substrate), the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches [...] The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of [...] between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.|$|E
500|$|The medium {{half-life}} of 227Ac (21.77 years) {{makes it}} very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain <b>homogeneously</b> dispersed 235U. Its decay product, 231Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231Pa decays to 227Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}} ...|$|E

[...] If the protein is present in low abundance, or if it has a high value, scientists may use recombinant DNA technology to develop cells that will produce large quantities of the desired protein (this is known as an expression system). Recombinant expression allows the protein to be tagged, e.g. by a His-tag or Strep-tag, to facilitate purification, which means that the purification can be done in fewer steps. In addition, recombinant expression usually starts with a higher fraction of the desired protein than is present in a natural source.|$|E

This practice is known as [...] "flipping". For the most part, criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator (for example, if a person wears a shirt that reads [...] "MAY" [...] on it, and gets flipped, then the word is altered to [...] "YAM"), who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions, resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something that flows <b>homogeneously.</b> If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture, such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic. Characters shown writing with their right hands, the majority of them, would become left-handed when a series is flipped. Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts, such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right, or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side, but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow, and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping.|$|E
