25|$|An <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> {{arising from}} the court record is that both Jasper Vinall and the batsman Edward Tye came from West Hoathly, another village, which {{indicates}} that games involving teams from different parishes were already being played at this early time in the sport's history.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{eccentric}} in its terminology, {{his philosophy}} is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, {{this is a}} psychological observation made to pass for logic.|$|E
25|$|It is an <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> to {{note that}} the {{selective}} breeding of cattle was almost impossible before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without much control from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a 'pure breed' was therefore practically impossible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Template {{attacks are}} widely {{accepted}} {{to be the}} most power-ful side-channel attacks from an information theoretic point of view. For template attacks to be practical, one needs to choose some special sam-ples as the <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> in actual power traces. Up to now, many different approaches were introduced for choosing <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> for template attacks. However, it is unknown that whether or not the previ-ous approaches of choosing <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> will lead to the best clas-sification performance of template attacks. In this work, we give a neg-ative answer to this important question by introducing a practical new approach which has completely different basic principle compared with all the previous approaches. Our new approach chooses the point whose distribution of samples approximates to a normal distribution as the in-teresting point. Evaluation results exhibit that template attacks based on the <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> chosen by our new approach can achieve obvious better classification performance compared with template attacks based on the <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> chosen by the previous approaches. Therefore, our new approach of choosing <b>interesting</b> <b>points</b> should be used in prac-tice to better understand the practical threats of template attacks...|$|R

25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
25|$|As {{capital of}} British Punjab, the area {{south of the}} Walled City {{contains}} many British colonial municipal structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the General Post Office, and Lahore Museum. The predominant architectural style {{is a mixture of}} Victorian and Islamic architecture, and {{is often referred to as}} Indo-Gothic. An <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> about Lahore's architecture is that unlike the emphasis on functional architecture in the west, much of Lahore's architecture has always been about making a statement as much as anything else.|$|E
25|$|An <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> of Jewish Law {{arises in}} that Rav Yisroel raised the {{question}} how could the Tribe of Reuven have kept the semikhah alive, since they were outside the Land of Israel and the semikhah can be granted only in Land of Israel. He answered that since the Bnei Reuven had been distant {{from the rest of}} Klal Yisroel before this ruling had been accepted, {{there is no reason to}} assume that they accepted this ruling, and there was a chance that they were still keeping the institution of semikhah alive.|$|E

25|$|An <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> of {{the design}} was {{that it did not}} use a {{traditional}} helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E

[...] {{to be able to make}} simple fiends from only fiend mix, more complicated ingredients are needed to make fiends with more potential.

2500|$|Although we {{are faced}} with a very {{convoluted}} narrative, García Márquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. [...] Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. [...] This is all presented through García Márquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most <b>interesting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Yet, with Revelation, the {{problems}} might be judged more fundamental. The author {{seems to be}} using his sources {{in a completely different}} way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40–48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall writes that Revelation [...] "is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative." [...] In trying to identify this [...] "something new", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The <b>interesting</b> <b>point</b> is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.|$|E
