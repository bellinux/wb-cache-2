5|$|In November 1978, a C-130H {{became the}} first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John PaulII's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.|$|E

25|$|No. 85 Squadron {{began to}} be re-equipped with Spitfire Mark V {{aircraft}} in September 1944. Exercises were undertaken with other air units in Western Australia, and the squadron's last Boomerangs left the unit on 12 January 1945. While all of the RAAF's other Spitfire-equipped fighter squadrons were reequipped with the superior Mark VIII Spitfires during 1944 and 1945, No. 85 Squadron retained its Mark Vs until it was disbanded. On 11 May the squadron was ordered to move to RAAF Station Pearce, and this transfer was completed five days later. On 7 July No. 85 Squadron escorted the aircraft carrying the remains of Prime Minister John Curtin to Perth from Canberra following his death. Following {{the end of the}} war the squadron conducted a <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> over Perth as part of the city's victory pageant and continued training flights until 20 September when all flying officially ceased. No. 85 Squadron was disbanded on 29 November.|$|E

500|$|The target {{selected}} for the first raid on Japan was the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, an industrial city about [...] from Chengdu. This was {{the single most important}} facility in Japan's steel industry as it produced 24 percent of the country's total output of rolled steel. The facility was dependent on three coke plants and the largest of these was selected as the designated aiming point for the B-29s. Nearby Laoyao harbor, which was an important industrial port, was designated as the raid's secondary target. The selection of Yawata's steel works as the first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by the Twentieth Air Force on 1April 1944 which assigned the highest priority to attacking Japan's steel and coke industry. It was decided to conduct the raid at night with each B-29 bombing individually as the aircraft lacked the range needed to conduct a more fuel-intensive <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> between the forward air bases and Yawata.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} {{applications}} {{of a general}} methodology that we developed for solving two-point boundary value problems. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi theory in conjunction with canonical transformation induced by the phase flow, we proved that the generating functions for this transformation solve any two-point boundary value problem in phase space. This method has implications in different fields as boundary value problems are widely spread and we succeeded to develop an efficient algorithm. We illustrate its use to solve optimal control problems without an initial guess, study the phase structure and plan spacecraft <b>formation</b> <b>flights...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{performance}} baseline for future cooperative, dual aircraft operations, an experimental evaluation of pilot-in-the-loop, dual aircraft system dynamics in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) was undertaken to examine pilot response time and system frequency response characteristics.

Using this data along with system identification tools, models have been created to quantify the human-in-the-loop performance of cooperative dual aircraft flight {{as a function of}} lead aircraft attitude and initial separation...|$|R

For aerial vehicles the advantages of performing <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> include fuel saving, improved efficiency in air traffic control and cooperative task allocation.

This time, the cadets fly nearly 120 hours all over the year, learning more complex acrobatics, four-aircraft <b>Formation</b> <b>Flights</b> and IFR navigation. At the end of the year, almost graduating as Aviator Officers, the top 30 pilots are designated for the Fighter Pilot Course.

Pinedo and Balbo later had a falling out after Balbo decided that the Italian government would support no more long-distance flights by single aircraft, which Pinedo preferred, and would instead focus its efforts on mass <b>formation</b> <b>flights,</b> and Pinedo played no role in Balbo's January 1931 mass-formation crossing of the South Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
