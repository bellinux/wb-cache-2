40|$|Commercially {{available}} carbon nanotubes and nanofibers {{were analyzed}} to examine possible relationships between their Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface areas (SSAs) and their {{physical and chemical}} properties. Properties found to <b>influence</b> <b>surface</b> area were number of walls/diameter, impurities, and surface functionalization with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Characterization by electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental analysis indicates that SSA can provide insight on carbon nanomaterials properties, which can differ vastly depending on synthesis parameters and post-production treatments. In this study, how different properties may <b>influence</b> <b>surface</b> area is discussed. The materials examined have {{a wide range of}} surface areas. The measured surface areas differed from product specifications, to varying degrees, and between similar products. Findings emphasize the multiple factors that <b>influence</b> <b>surface</b> area and mark its utility in carbon nanomaterial characterization, a prerequisite to understanding their potential applications and toxicities.

40|$|In ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM), {{the impulse}} spindle {{vibration}} {{induced by the}} impulse-like cutting forces is intrinsic and special mechanism majorly <b>influencing</b> <b>surface</b> topography. It is fundamentally distinctive with the step spindle vibration induced by the step-like cutting forces in turning. However, no work has been conducted to study surface generation under the impulse spindle vibration in UPRM in depth. Consequently, this paper theoretically and experimentally elaborates that in UPRM, (i) the impulse spindle vibration includes the axial, radial and coupled-tilting spindle vibration with damping; (ii) the excitation frequency of the impulse-like cutting forces, i. e. spindle speed, determines the spindle vibration characteristics, i. e. synchronous or asynchronous spindle vibration; (iii) the coupled-tilting spindle vibration is a predominant factor <b>influencing</b> <b>surface</b> generation; and (iv) the irregular spindle-vibration waves induced by the impulse spindle vibration produce one of the irregular, lattice-like and stripe patterns or their hybrids at a milled surface.

40|$|The mean {{curvature}} of the <b>influence</b> <b>surface</b> of the space-time point (x, t) appears in linear supersonic propeller noise theory and in the Kirchhoff formula for a supersonic surface. Both these problems are governed by the linear wave equation with sources on a moving surface. The <b>influence</b> <b>surface</b> is also called the Sigma - surface in the aeroacoustic literature. This surface is the locus, in a frame fixed to the quiescent medium, of all the points of a radiating surface f(x, t) = 0 whose acoustic signals arrive simultaneously to an observer at position x {{and at the time}} t. Mathematically, the Sigma- surface is produced by the intersection of the characteristic conoid of the space-time point (x, t) and the moving surface. In this paper, we derive the expression for the local {{mean curvature}} of the Sigma - space of the space-time point for a moving rigid or deformable surface f(x, t) = 0. This expression is a complicated function of the geometric and kinematic parameters of the surface f(x, t) = 0.

The presence of B steps is beneficial for the InP morphology; simultaneous presence of A steps gives rise to (110) facets, which lead to macro-step formation. From a B step up edge no new B steps are generated during growth, causing a macroscopic ripple pattern starting from this edge.

Furthermore, the surface diffusion is clearly anisotropic with fast diffusion along [01 ̄ 1]. The morphological features can be explained by assuming a (2 × 4) reconstruction during growth...|$|E
