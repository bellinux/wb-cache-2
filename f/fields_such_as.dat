5|$|In <b>fields</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where {{direct observation}} or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, {{the scientific method}} instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
