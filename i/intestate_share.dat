50|$|Another {{party for}} whom the state might provide is the pretermitted spouse, whom the {{testator}} does not marry until after {{the execution of the}} will. Many jurisdictions provide that a pretermitted spouse will receive either her <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> (what she would have received had the testator died with no will), or the elective share (a set amount or formula provided by law for spouses who are disinherited in the will).|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} {{in the general}} assembly, Tyler was an {{advocate}} for victims of violent crimes, introducing legislation on intestate succession, which states that a parent may not receive an <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> of the estate of the parent's minor or adult child if the parent was convicted of causing {{the death of the}} child's other parent. Tyler resigned from the Legislature in December 2011 to assume the duties of Mayor effective January 1, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Foman's father {{allegedly}} {{promised her}} {{he would not}} execute a will in exchange for Foman caring for her mother until her mother's death. After her mother died, Foman's father married Davis, and, contrary to the alleged promise, executed a will leaving his entire estate to Davis. Following her father's death, Foman filed suit against Davis in the District of Massachusetts to recover {{what would have been}} her <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> of her father's estate, that is, the amount she would have gotten had he not executed a will, as he allegedly promised.|$|E
5000|$|On Fredirick II's {{death in}} 1751 all Manor {{holdings}} {{and the title}} went to his eldest son Frederick Philipse III, the third Lord of the Manner of Philipsburg. The Highland Patent [...] - [...] subsequently known as the Philipse Patent [...] - [...] was divided among Frederick II's surviving offspring, son Philip Philipse, and daughters, Susannah (wife of Beverley Robinson), Mary (wife of Col. Roger Morris), and Margaret (who died <b>intestate,</b> her <b>share</b> being divided among the other three).|$|R
50|$|Many jurisdictions {{have enacted}} {{statutes}} that permit a pretermitted child to demand an inheritance under the will. Some allow {{the child to}} claim their <b>intestate</b> <b>share,</b> while others limit the inheritance to an amount that is comparable to devises made in the will for {{the children who were}} alive when the will was written. This may be accomplished by proportionally reducing the gift under the will to the other children, or by reducing gifts under the will to non-family members. An exception common to many jurisdictions prohibits a pretermitted child from claiming an inheritance if the will devised substantially all of the testator's estate to the surviving spouse, and the surviving spouse is the other parent of the pretermitted child.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} 2 ̆ 2 marital {{property}} rights 2 ̆ 2 is very timely because those rights {{are in a}} state of transition. The term 2 ̆ 2 marital property rights 2 ̆ 2 covers a vast multitude of rights or interests conferred by law on persons who occupy the status of spouse. This lecture is divided into four discrete, yet related segments. The first segment addresses how the law allocates original ownership between spouses in a marriage. The second segment turns to the <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> of the surviving spouse. This is not a topic that high-powered estate planners get involved in very much because intestate estates are usually fairly small. But to the surviving spouse, the <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> can mark the difference between economic security and poverty. The third segment addresses the rights of spouses upon divorce and disinheritance at death. The fourth and final segment surveys some recent developments regarding the rights of persons who are not spouses at all, but 2 ̆ 2 near-spouses. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|As {{cohabitation}} among unmarried couples {{becomes more}} common in the United States, a most pressing challenge facing inheritance law scholars, practitioners and others who concern themselves with the development of inheritance law is to craft reforms that would, if implemented, better serve non-marital families {{while at the same time}} maintain a reasonable ease of administration of estates. One area in urgent need of such reform is intestacy law. Current intestacy law generally does not reflect as well as it could the way Americans today structure their family lives. For example, the intestacy statutes of forty-seven states make no provision for the survivor of a non-marital committed partnership. This article proposes to change that. Professor Spitko has structured an intestacy statute that looks beyond the attributed intent of the decedent in order to protect those surviving committed partners who contributed significantly to the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s wealth or physical well-being or who sacrificed career opportunities for the good of the partnership. To implement these reciprocity and reliance values, Professor Spitko identifies twenty-three factors (the 2 ̆ 2 multi-factor 2 ̆ 2 test) that a court should use to qualify a committed partner for the purposes of the intestacy statute. His proposal also sets forth an accrual schedule that determines the size of the surviving committed partner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> based on the duration of the partnership. Professor Spitko further proposes to give an <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> to the survivor of a committed partnership that fractured prior to the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s death if, under the circumstances, the survivor 2 ̆ 7 s reciprocity or reliance interests should be vindicated. And he proposes to alter the rules for standing to challenge a committed partner 2 ̆ 7 s will in order to minimize the uncertainty that the proposal necessarily would introduce into the probate process...|$|E
40|$|Part I of this Article {{examines}} {{the doctrine of}} equitable adoption, focusing on its deficiencies in addressing {{some of the issues}} of the modern family. Part II considers the specific issue of intestate succession, the way that the equitable adoption doctrine falls short in providing a consistent rational result of heirship in the modern family, and the reasons for expanding inheritance rights to “family members” claiming an <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> {{despite the fact that they}} were not born into or legally adopted into the family arrangement. Part III proposes answers to these difficult problems, suggesting a statutory provision defining “child,” for inheritance purposes, to include children raised in families that are not their families of birth, but avoiding denominating this relationship as one of “adoption” [...] carrying with it a suggestion of a legal sanction which these relationships lack...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{examples of}} inheritance law reform {{in different countries}} all dealing with the current transformations of family structures. The first part analyses discussions in US and English law on the <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> of spouses in second or subsequent marriages {{in relation to the}} share of the children of the deceased. The second part summarises the author’s own suggestions for the reform of Swiss inheritance law having regard to empirical social science literature on changing family realities. The examples from the three legal systems reveal that, although the relationship between the “Is” and the “Ought” is fundamentally different depending on the legal tradition, in both the Anglo-American and the continental European context the use of social science knowledge in inheritance law reform is currently predominantly based on a model of social science as a mere adjunct of legal studies. The author argues in the third part of the article that, especially for the complex situation of blended families, genuine transdisciplinary research could be a promising means of developing innovative solutions for inheritance law reform...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{will attempt}} to {{describe}} and evalute {{certain aspects of the}} wealth transmission process. Attention will be given to the surviving spouse 2 ̆ 7 s <b>intestate</b> <b>share</b> and its size, the spouse 2 ̆ 7 s protection against disinheritance through forced share legislation or otherwise, and, more significantly, whether such a drastic legislative intrusion on freedom of testation is really needed. The adequacy of the support allowance for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s family during the period of administration will also be explored. Attention will also be focused on selected provisions of the intestacy scheme, such as the order of succession, the doctrine of advancements, whether distribution is per capita or per stirpes, and whether unlimited inheritance by remote collateral relatives should continue to be allowed. Finally, special situations which affect the normal course of inheritance will be considered. For example, the rules that determine succession by, from, and through adopted and illegitimate children and the effect of homicide of the decedent on the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s right to succession will be discussed. In all of these areas contemporary statutory patterns will be described, including those of Georgia and other states throughout the country. Suggestions will be made with a view toward improving existing legislation so as to make the process work better and more effectively...|$|E
