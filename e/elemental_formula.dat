30|$|A {{study on}} volunteers {{indicated}} that <b>elemental</b> <b>formula</b> has a less stimulatory {{effect on the}} secretion of pancreatic lipase and chymotrypsin compared to food homogenate [36]. <b>Elemental</b> <b>formula</b> is expected to achieve both maintenance of gut immunity and suppression of exocrine secretions in the pancreas, suggesting that <b>elemental</b> <b>formula</b> is theoretically beneficial for patients with acute pancreatitis. However, contrary to this assumption, {{the results of this}} study failed to show the superiority of <b>elemental</b> <b>formula</b> compared to semi-elemental and polymeric formulae, and several reasons for this can be considered. It has been reported that trans-jejunal feeding of polymeric formulae was well tolerated by patients with acute pancreatitis and can potentially be used to facilitate pancreatic rest [37]. This means that standard formulae also could achieve pancreatic rest by controlling the route of administration; however, information on the dosage regimen and administration route could not be evaluated in this study. In addition, a study comparing the absorption of nutrients in patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency who were administered elemental or polymeric formulae with and without pancreatic enzymes showed that no benefit was experienced by patients who were administered <b>elemental</b> <b>formula,</b> compared to those administered the polymeric formula with pancreatic enzymes [38]. This result suggested that patients with pancreatic insufficiency could utilize polymeric formulae as opposed to elemental formulae, with pancreatic enzyme supplementation as needed. Furthermore, a recent experimental study in mice [39] showed the advantage of a semi-elemental formula compared to <b>elemental</b> <b>formula</b> from the perspective of absorption, tolerability, and maintenance of gut immunity.

The concept of “pancreatic rest” had been widely believed to be the standard nutritional strategy in the management of acute pancreatitis; therefore, total parenteral nutrition had been widely used up to the 1990 s [6, 7].

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} {{different}} approaches have been proposed to predict <b>elemental</b> component <b>formulas</b> (or molecular formulas) of molecular ions in low and medium resolution mass spectra. Most of them rely on isotope patterns, enumerate all possible formulas for an ion, and exclude certain formulas violating chemical constraints. However, these methods cannot be well generalized to the component prediction of fragment ions in tandem mass spectra. In this paper, a new method, FFP (Fragment ion Formula Prediction), is presented to predict <b>elemental</b> component <b>formulas</b> of fragment ions. In the FFP method, the prediction of the best formulas is converted into the minimization of the distance between theoretical and observed isotope patterns. And, then, a novel local search model is proposed to generate a set of candidate formulas efficiently. After the search, FFP applies a new multiconstraint filtering to exclude as many invalid and improbable formulas as possible. FFP is experimentally compared with the previous enumeration methods, and shown to outperform them significantly. The results of this paper can help to improve the reliability of de novo {{in the identification of}} peptide sequences. Index Terms—Isotope patterns, peptide sequencing, tandem mass spectra. ...|$|R
