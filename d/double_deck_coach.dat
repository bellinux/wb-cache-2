50|$|In {{an effort}} to broaden {{the appeal of the}} <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach</b> a 4m high version was offered, with sleeker styling. Known as the Metroliner 400GT this was the rarest variant with only three {{examples}} built in 1987-88. Two went to Central Coachways, one of which had initially been a demonstrator, whilst Yorkshire Traction took the third.|$|E
50|$|The express coach {{services}} between London, the Medway Towns and Maidstone were re-branded Invictaway in {{the early}} 1980s, this name also being applied to route 900 between Gillingham and Gatwick Airport. An all-over black livery was used. To enhance these services, several batches of Leyland Olympians with ECW <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach</b> bodies were acquired and painted in a green and white livery. This was later applied to the whole Invictaway fleet.|$|E
50|$|There {{were more}} rail strikes in June and July, which {{resulted}} in 17 double deck duplicates being used by Southend, {{some of which were}} provided by Ensignbus. At the end of July 1982, a Neoplan <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach,</b> was tried on the route for a day, and a Bova single deck coach was similarly used on 18 August. However, an order was placed for three Van Hool Astromega double deck coaches.|$|E

50|$|Another <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach</b> was {{developed}} around 1968 for motorway running by Standerwick within Ribble ownership. This time a 60-seater {{built on a}} Bristol VRL/LH chassis driven by a Leyland Power Plus 680 engine mounted vertically and longitudinally behind the off-side rear axle. In total 30 were delivered starting with vehicle 50, which was used for trials; and followed by three batches, given fleet numbers 51 to 61, 62 to 71 and finally 72 to 79.|$|E
50|$|Motorways were {{developed}} in the late 1950s - in 1958 the M6 Preston Bypass was the first motorway in the UK. Arrangements were in hand for a totally new <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach,</b> based on the Leyland Atlantean, 50 reclining seats, toilet and {{plenty of room for}} luggage. Christened 'Gay Hostess', these coaches were a common sight on the M6 and the M1 in the 1960s. One was {{at the opening of the}} M1, and Ribble milked the publicity for all it was worth.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 August 1973, Tyne & Wear PTE {{acquired}} two associated Newcastle-based businesses, R Armstrong (Bus Proprietor) Ltd. and Galley’s Coaches Ltd., {{and immediately}} the [...] "Armstrong Galley" [...] name was adopted for the PTE's coaching and private hire division. Initially retaining the original PTE yellow and cream colours (of Newcastle Corporation), [...] a new colour scheme of mid-blue with yellow, orange and red stripes was adopted around 1980. Armstrong Galley introduced a flagship service to London {{in the early}} 1980s, competing with National Express, and branded [...] "Non-Stop Clipper". and used the striking 3 axle <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coach,</b> the MCW Metroliner. The Armstrong Galley operations continued unchanged {{with the creation of}} Busways in October 1986, but in the early 1990s it expanded into low-cost bus operation (using other divisions' cast-offs), culminating in an [...] "Armstrong Galley Buses" [...] operation being set up. These vehicles used a livery of mid-blue and white After the Stagecoach takeover, the Armstrong Galley operations were closed down, with buses being transferred to Blue Bus Services.|$|E

50|$|Few Metroliners were {{purchased}} for touring or private hire work, although many {{were used for}} such duties after retiring from express duties. Due to the limited demand for older <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches</b> and the high seating capacity on the upper deck, many double-deck Metroliner DR130s were converted to open-top buses by Ensignbus, for use on their London Pride Sightseeing operation, latterly passing to The Original Tour.|$|R
50|$|The most {{numerous}} type of Metroliner was {{the early}} <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> DR130 design. This was {{designed specifically for}} UK express services and thus differed from contemporary <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches</b> in its height. Most such coaches are under 4m in height as this is the maximum permitted in continental Europe, but this severely limits the interior headroom. The DR130 was higher, allowing a much more spacious interior, but making the design unsuitable for continental tours and limiting its appeal on the secondhand market.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{are of the}} Prima type, {{produced at}} Alstom's plant in Valencia, Spain in collaboration with GM-EMD; the locomotives use EMD traction equipment and an EMD 710 engine. They were acquired to provide additional passenger services created {{as a result of}} investment in the 1990s which included the re-opening of several lines to passenger traffic. The locomotives are used to propel push-pull trains - a typical formation (2009) uses one locomotive, five <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches,</b> and a <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> driving trailer; the vehicles were the main passenger locomotive of IR, and half of its locomotive fleet (2007).|$|R
50|$|In 1992 {{the green}} livery was simplified, with the {{introduction}} of some <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches,</b> long wheelbase Leyland Olympians with ECW bodywork, with distinctive sloped top front windows. The forward stripes were removed, and the M&D logo sloped along the leading edge. While the coaches wore Invictaway livery, as part of the M&D fleet, they could occasionally be seen on other local services when the need arose, and were also used on tours further afield. Some of the last coaches to wear the M&D Invictaway livery were a batch of J registered Plaxton 321 bodied Leyland Tigers.|$|R

50|$|Class Z23500 is a {{class of}} railway {{electric}} multiple units operated in France. They were built by Alstom and Ateliers du Nord de la France, (which became Bombardier) for SNCF and are used on the TER Network. These sets consist of 2 <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches.</b> They were built from 1997 {{and a total of}} 80 units were built. The units were ordered by the following regions: Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Rhône-Alpes. They are mainly used on stopping services around the French Riviera (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur), Lille (Nord-Pas-de-Calais) and Lyon (Rhône-Alpes).They are all in the TER livery, which is a Blue Front in a diagonal line with a metallic grey side. However the Rhône-Alpes units have green and purple sides with Rhône-Alpes written on the side in Large writing.|$|R

5000|$|Megabus {{is a low}} cost, [...] "no-frills" [...] {{intercity}} {{bus service}} launched in the United Kingdom by Stagecoach in 2003, on 10 April 2006 in the United States, and in 2009 within Canada. Its main rival in the UK is National Express, who have had to lower their prices to compete with Megabus. In the US, Megabus/Eastern Shuttle's main rival is BoltBus, which is 50% owned by Stagecoach rival FirstGroup. In the UK, the Megabus network covers most of the island of Great Britain, although some routes offer only one journey per day. Originally operated using high capacity but older coach seated buses, most services are now operated with new modern single or <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches.</b> In the United States, services radiate from Chicago and New York City, but the networks are not connected. In both the UK and the US, to cut costs, most services use on-street bus stops rather than pay for access to coach stations (except in cases where pre-existing routes were converted to Megabus lines). A notable exception to this {{is the use of}} London Victoria Coach Station.|$|R
40|$|Modern railway {{vehicles}} are requested to achieve improved performances together with higher safety for passengers and crew: {{for this reason}} recent European and National Standards claim for more demanding tests for type approval. In this contest, the initial phase of type approval’s tests became very important {{in order to achieve}} good results before the on line tests. This paper deals with the set up of test bench to perform type approval tests on carbody, used for the new Italian <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches.</b> This bench is composed by two longitudinal beams headed by two crossbeams: at one side hydraulic actuators are placed in order to apply the requested load. With a simple procedures is available to perform compression test on bumpers and also compression or traction test on a coupler a worm screw it is possible to apply both traction or compression loads to the carbody. At the other side there is only a reaction crossbeam, rigidly connected with the longitudinal member. Moreover a truss structure should be mounted at one end in order to apply the load at higher levels. The reaction is, however, provided at the other side at bumper level, as stated in the European norm EN 12663. So, this test bench allowed to perform traction and compression tests, at bumpers level or in higher position (window level or roof). The driving/trailer and the trailer <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaches</b> tested with this new test bench will compose the 60 new 5 coaches “Vivalto” regional train of Trenitalia developed from October 2005, with the main following characteristics: - Number of seats/places: 90 / 126 - Maximum speed: 160 Km/h The first phase regarded compression tests at bumper level. The European Standard (EN 12663) provide for 2 x 1000 kN symmetric load applied on the head beam of the carbody in the bumper zone and for 2000 kN on the coupler area. Moreover diagonal compression tests are requested: this test is performed applying a force up to 500 kN at one bumper, reacting at the opposite side. The test bench is able, with small adjustments, to provide traction test on the couplers, applying up to 1500 kN, as suggested in the EN 12663 Standard for different types of automatic coupler. In addition, the EN standard provides for compression tests at different height, applying high level loads (up to 400 kN) up to the roof level, by means of an auxiliary truss structure between test bench and carbody. Thusthese compression tests were performed in the third phase: 400 kN 150 mm over the bumpers, 300 kN at window level and 300 kN at the roof level. In the full paper the results of the test listed before will be summarised giving the evidence of the great correspondence with the results of FEM calculations...|$|R
50|$|Class 27 {{locomotives}} are {{the staple}} power for SNCB/NMBS. They work {{all over the}} 3000 volt electrified lines including the occasional trip through to Luxembourg City. The arrival of Class 13 had little impact on Class 27 {{at the time as}} the 13s were occupied with trains of I11 coaching stock and goods trains working on newly electrified sections under 25000 volts, 50 HZ where Class 27s could not go. Class 27s were frequently engaged in pulling heavy freights from the Flemish ports to the sorting yard at Montzen, near the German border. They also pulled a number of passenger services including peak hour trains of M5 <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>coaching</b> stock. They have become very active on trains with the newer M6 stock. Locos 2742 to 2760 have been modified with MUX and automatic couplers at one end so they can work in multiple in push-pull trains made up of two Class 27s each with a rake of five M6 coaches running one behind the other. The trains start at separate destinations and join up later to run together as a unit over most of their route. Later they split up and go their separate ways to their final destinations and reverse for the return journey. These locos have been showing frame wear because they were not originally designed for this kind of service so SNCB is monitoring them closely. These MUX locomotives have been replaced on freight duties by Class 13, which have lost most of their passenger duties.|$|R
