Literature highlights the complexity of changing student views {{and the need for}} sustained, comprehensive approaches to teaching foundation content.

It finds significant shifts in views and knowledge gained from studying the foundation course, and a change in commitment to social justice and reconciliation for Indigenous Australians. Students also significantly changed their view as to whether all Australians should understand this material. Despite these gains, our experiences indicate that foundational courses can be eroded through institutional processes. We argue this suggests the persistence of pervasive and subtle <b>institutional</b> <b>racisms,</b> in the context of global commodification of higher education...|$|R

40|$|Through {{studying}} the intersections of sanitation and segregation in Brooklyn, New York in the post-WWII era, this thesis reveals {{a web of}} willful white negligence that constructed a narrative that supports continued environmental injustices towards black Americans. As a result of housing discrimination, the lack of sanitation, and {{the political and social}} climate of the 1950 s, black neighborhoods in Brooklyn became dirtier with abandoned garbage. <b>Institutional</b> anti-black <b>racism</b> not only permitted and supported the degradation of black neighborhoods, but also created an association between black Americans and trash. In the present day, this narrative not only leads to the increased segregation of black Americans into dirty neighborhoods, but also justifies more environmental injustice in these vulnerable communities. Based on a case study of Brooklyn in the 1950 s, this thesis asserts that environmental injustices are more than just siting landfills and toxic sites proximate to vulnerable neighborhoods, but rather they are dependent on the creation and preservation of narratives that claim minority communities are naturally predisposed to or deserving of living in dirty and unclean places...|$|R

This incident is considered to be the beginning of the environmental justice movement: a movement to address the fact the injustice that communities of color face. Research shows that there is racial discrimination in the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. People of color and the poor are more likely to live, work and play in America’s most polluted environments. Communities of color tend to be disproportionately exposed to lead, pesticides, and petrochemical plants. Unfortunately, race and class is a reliable indicator of how where industrial plants and waste facilities are located. <b>Institutional</b> environmental <b>racism</b> encompasses these land use decisions that contribute to health issues such as asthma obesity and diabetes.|$|R

With his promotion of school choice, quantifiable teacher quality, academic excellence, and the promotion of education as an economic imperative, President Obama maintains the neoliberal hegemony in education. Such hegemony promotes technical rationality. It also continues the <b>institutional</b> and internalized <b>racism</b> felt within and throughout American life. With presidents having the ability to communicate unencumbered with their citizens, the impact of Presidential communication can either set or rupture the status quo. Through this critical discourse analysis studying the statements and remarks of President Obama in seven speeches pertaining to PK- 12 education, there was evidence that suggested President Obama views education as an economic entity that continues the neoliberal outlook of society and the technical rationality outlook persistent in schools. Other evidence suggests that President Obama also reinforces colorblind and individualistic approaches to talking of race which could serve to further embed the <b>institutional</b> and internalized <b>racism</b> in public education...|$|R

Specifically, I critically analyzed how social power and identity based on gender and race were discursively represented in these EFL textbooks. I also critically examined how banking education and neoliberalism as a western political and socioeconomic ideology shaped the content of these EFL textbooks. The results indicate that the overt and hidden discourses in the EFL textbooks I analyzed serve as a state apparatus to reproduce and perpetuate certain neoconservative and neoliberal ideologies and interests including males’ supremacy and dominance, patriarchy, sexism, women’s subordination and marginalization, functional illiteracy, meritocracy, individualism, and the achievement ideology. The results also reveal that the EFL textbooks I explored serve to promote banking education, depoliticize English language teaching and learning, legitimate and perpetuate white male supremacy, <b>institutional</b> colorblind <b>racism,</b> and the racialization of the English language and the idealized native-speaker’s identity of English.

25|$|Critical race theory {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by the language of critical legal studies, which challenged concepts such as objective truth, rationality and judicial neutrality, and by critical theory. Academics and activists disillusioned with the outcomes of the civil African-American Civil Rights Movement pointed out that though African Americans supposedly enjoyed legal equality, white Americans continued to hold disproportionate power and still had superior living standards. Liberal ideas such as meritocracy and equal opportunity, they argued, hid and reinforced deep structural inequalities and thus serves the interests of a white elite. Critical race theorists see racism as embedded in public attitudes and institutions, and highlight <b>institutional</b> <b>racism</b> and unconscious biases. Legal scholar Derrick Bell advanced the interest convergence principle, which suggests that whites support minority rights only when doing so is also in their self-interest.|$|E

During the 1966 election, his record had won him the endorsement of Roy Wilkins, leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In mid-1967, racial tension was rising nationally, fueled by black discontent and an increasingly assertive civil rights leadership. Several cities exploded in violence, and there were riots in Cambridge, Maryland, after an incendiary speech there on July 24, 1967, by radical student leader H. Rap Brown. Agnew's principal concern was to maintain law and order, and he denounced Brown as a professional agitator: [...] "I hope they put him away and throw away the key." [...] When the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson to investigate {{the causes of the}} unrest, reported that the principal factor was <b>institutional</b> white <b>racism,</b> Agnew dismissed these findings, blaming the [...] "permissive climate and misguided compassion" [...] and adding: [...] "It is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but... that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occasionally stylish form of dissent". In March 1968, when faced with a student boycott at Bowie State College, a historically black institution, Agnew again blamed outside agitators and refused to negotiate with the students. When a student committee came to Annapolis and demanded a meeting, Agnew closed the college and ordered more than 200 arrests.|$|R
