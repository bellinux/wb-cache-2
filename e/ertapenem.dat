2500|$|Beta-lactamases (β-lactamases, {{also known}} as penicillinase) are enzymes (...) {{produced}} by bacteria, that provide multi-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, Cephalosporins, [...] cephamycins, and carbapenems (<b>ertapenem),</b> although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a β-lactam. Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.|$|E
2500|$|While ESBL-producing organisms were {{previously}} associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly {{found in the}} community. [...] CTX-M-15-positive E. coli are a cause of community-acquired urinary infections in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as quinolones and sulfonamides. [...] Treatment options may include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, mecillinam and chloramphenicol. [...] In desperation, once-daily <b>ertapenem</b> or gentamicin injections may also be used.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the family}} {{commonly}} express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, {{a new group of}} enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Thus ESBLs confer multi-resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. [...] A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. [...] The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily <b>ertapenem</b> resistant) isolates have recently been reported. [...] ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. [...] However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ertapenem</b> is dosed as 1 g {{given by}} {{intravenous}} injection over 30 minutes, or 1 g diluted with 3.2 ml of 1% lidocaine given intramuscularly. There is no oral preparation of <b>ertapenem</b> available. <b>Ertapenem</b> cannot be mixed with glucose.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{adverse effects}} of <b>ertapenem</b> like {{confusion}} and headache, which may worsen to convulsions and seizures. The only absolute contra-indication is a previous anaphylactic reaction to <b>ertapenem</b> or other β-lactam antibiotic. There are no studies done in pregnant women, so the manufacturers cannot comment on its safety in pregnancy. In 2006, <b>Ertapenem</b> became approved for pediatric use in certain infections. <b>Ertapenem</b> is not recommended for children under 3 months of age and children with meningitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ertapenem</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} to be effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

50|$|Acquired {{resistance}} to <b>ertapenem</b> is usually mediated by up-regulation of efflux mechanisms {{and by the}} selection of porin-deficient mutants. Organisms that produce a metallo-&beta;-lactamase are innately immune to <b>ertapenem</b> (as well as all carbapenems).|$|E

50|$|The β-lactam {{family of}} {{antibiotic}} molecules {{consists of four}} groups: cephalosporins, monobactam, penicillins, and carbapenems. Different drugs, such as <b>ertapenem,</b> imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem, belong to the class of carbapenem antibiotics.|$|E

5000|$|Meropenem, {{sold under}} the brandname Merrem among others, is an broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} infections. It is a β-lactam and belongs to the subgroup of carbapenems, similar to imipenem and <b>ertapenem.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ertapenem</b> is a {{carbapenem}} antibiotic marketed by Merck as Invanz. It is structurally {{very similar}} to meropenem in that it possesses a 1-β-methyl group. Other members of the carbapenem group (imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem) are broadly active antibacterials that are used for infections caused by difficult to treat or multidrug-resistant bacteria (such as ESBL expressing Klebsiella pneumonia). They have very short serum half-lives and must be administered by intravenous infusion every 6 to 8 hours. <b>Ertapenem</b> differs from other carbapenems in having a somewhat less broad spectrum of activity (not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and in that its extended serum half-life allows it to be administered once every 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|Carbapenems are {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with prior allergic reactions to beta lactam antibiotics. In addition, as the intramuscular formulations of <b>ertapenem</b> and imipenem are formulated with lidocaine, the intramuscular formulation of these two drugs are contraindicated {{in patients with}} prior adverse reactions to lidocaine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ertapenem</b> is marketed by Merck as a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} community-acquired infections. It {{should not be}} used as empirical treatment for hospital-acquired infections because of its lack of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In practice, it is reserved primarily for use against Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and high level AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether any {{particular}} antibiotic is better than any another for curing infection or avoiding amputation. One trial suggested that <b>ertapenem</b> with or without vancomycin {{is more effective than}} tigecycline for resolving DFIs. It is also generally unclear whether different antibiotics are associated with more or fewer adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Variations {{are seen}} in the media used for inoculation. Many studies use media with 1 to 2 mg/l of imipenem. However, {{bacteria}} that produce OXA-48 or OXA-181 result in low-level resistance, which cannot be detected efficiently due to the high concentration.Therefore, more recent screening media use broth containing 0.5-1 mg/l imipenem or 0.5 mg/l <b>ertapenem.</b>|$|E
50|$|If the {{specific}} Klebsiella {{in a particular}} patient does not show antibiotic resistance, then the antibiotics used to treat such susceptible isolates include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, meropenem, <b>ertapenem</b> and ciprofloxacin. Some experts recommend the use of meropenem for patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella. The claim is that meropenem produces the best bacterial clearing.|$|E
5000|$|For mild-to-moderate community-acquired {{infections in}} adults, the agents {{recommended}} for empiric regimens are: ticarcillin- clavulanate, cefoxitin, <b>ertapenem,</b> moxifloxacin, or tigecycline as single-agent therapy or combinations of metronidazole with cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin.
