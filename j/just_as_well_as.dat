She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able}} to scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

25|$|Edmund Randolph, who had {{presented}} the Virginia Plan, {{was the most}} outspoken opponent of the unitary executive, arguing {{that it would be}} unpopular with the people and could easily become monarchical. He warned against using the British government {{as a model for the}} Constitution, noting that energy, dispatch, and responsibility could be found in three men drawn from three different regions of the country <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> in one.

25|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Empedocles {{postulated}} that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water.

25|$|Quantitative {{ultrasound}} {{has many}} advantages in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing radiation is involved, measurements {{can be made}} quickly and easily, {{and the cost of}} the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> to adults. Some ultrasound devices can be used on the tibia.|$|E
25|$|Age for {{decrease}} of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, {{depending on the}} combinations of the speaker’s first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners are worse than native speakers depends on how dissimilar the L1 and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old. This {{is due to the}} fact that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.|$|E
25|$|Unsworth {{shot the}} film in Panavision. Interiors were filmed at Elstree Studios. Exterior {{shooting}} was mostly done in France in 1973, with a railroad workshop near Paris standing in for Istanbul station. The scenes of the train proceeding through central Europe were filmed in the Jura Mountains on the then-recently closed railway line from Pontarlier to Gilley, with the scenes of the train stuck in snow being filmed in a cutting near Montbenoît. There were concerns about a lack of snow in the weeks preceding the scheduled shooting of the snowbound train, and plans were made to truck in large quantities of snow at considerable expense. However, heavy snowfall {{the night before the}} shooting made the extra snow unnecessary — <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> the snow-laden backup trucks had themselves become stuck in the snow.|$|E

25|$|Bompas' journey {{began on}} June 30, 1865, {{when he left}} London for Liverpool, {{from where he was}} to take a steamer to New York. From New York Bompas {{travelled}} to Niagara via the Hudson River and railway, subsequently making his way to Chicago, La Crosse and St. Paul. Upon reaching St. Cloud, a problem presented itself to Bompas' travelling party. In 1862, a Sioux massacre occurred, and the local Indians were wary of another attack. However, Bompas was advised that they would respect the English flag. Although the party did not have an English flag on hand, Bompas took initiative and crafted a banner for their ox-carts. This was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> Indians who had ridden up in their horses to survey the ox-cart party left them alone once they spotted their flags.|$|E
25|$|Harpoons {{were invented}} {{and used for}} the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic (BP); the {{invention}} of these devices brought fish into the human diets, which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply. Thanks to their technology and their advanced social structures, Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals—who had a Middle Paleolithic level of technology—appear to have hunted large game <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> Upper Paleolithic modern humans. and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons. Nonetheless, Neanderthal use of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely (or perhaps never) and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with mêlée weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons.|$|E
25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> {{most of his life}} seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E

25|$|The National Army, or Imperial Army {{during the}} monarchy, {{was divided into}} two branches: the 1st Line, which was the Army itself; and the 2nd Line, which was formed by the Militias and Orderlies {{inherited}} from the colonial times. When the Portuguese military in the provinces of the Bahia, Maranhão, Pará and Cisplatine refused to join the Independence cause, Emperor Pedro I reorganized the troops at his disposal for the imminent conflict. Most of the personnel stationed in the country remained loyal to the monarch, who made use of troops, equipment and forts for the war operations. The terrestrial force efficiently fought {{in the north and}} the south of Brazil, defeating the loyal troops of Portugal. In 1824 the Army of the 1st Line included 24,000 men, who were disciplined, trained and equipped <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> European equivalents. At the end of the war of Independence, the Brazilian Armed Forces were already well organized and equipped. This occurred mainly because Pedro I heavily supported the Army. In the same year a battalion was sent to Pernambuco where it successfully quelled the revolt of the Confederation of the Equator.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to focus on bombing Britain's {{industrial}} cities, in daylight to begin with. The main focus was London. The first major raid took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although {{there were a few}} large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got under way against London and other British cities. However, the Luftwaffe faced limitations. Its aircraft—Dornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 88, and Heinkel He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic missions but were incapable of doing greater damage because of their small bomb-loads. The Luftwaffes decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939; OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> a heavy bomber force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.|$|E
25|$|The text {{starts off}} with a prologue (verses 1 through 666). King Ban, Lanzelet’s father, reigns as a tyrant over Genewis, which René Pérennec equates to the Kingdom of Gaunnes. He treats the noblemen in the {{hierarchy}} as he would the common people, and his vassals cannot accept this. They rise against King Ban, destroying the kingdom and killing everyone in the castle. They nonetheless allow Elaine, King Ban's wife, to live as she is known for her kindness. She escapes, while {{the queen of the}} sea-fairies, takes Lanzelet away to raise him on an island inhabited by women. There, he learns how to use weapons <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> he learns music and song. Lanzelet yearns to know his own name but the fairy refuses to reveal it to him until he has defeated her worst enemy, Iweret. On his journey, Lanzelet meets a dwarf, who whips him, and then a knight named Johfrit de Liez, who teaches him the rudiments of chivalry. In verses 667 to 1356, Lanzelet meets two knights named Kuraus and Orphilet; they enter the house of a woodsman named Galagandreiz. The following night, Lanzelet sleeps with Galandreiz's daughter. Galandreiz, upon finding her in Lanzelet’s bed becomes enraged. He and Lanzelet engage in a battle ending in Galandreiz's death. Lanzelet then marries the woodsman’s daughter and becomes a lord.|$|E
