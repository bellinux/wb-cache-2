5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession.</b> The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

40|$|Huge {{electromagnetic}} fields {{are known to}} be present during the late stages of the dynamics of supernovae. Thus, when dealing with electrodynamics in this context, the possibility may arise to probe nonlinear theories (generalizations of the Maxwellian electromagnetism). We firstly solve Einstein field equations minimally coupled to an arbitrary (current-free) nonlinear Lagrangian of electrodynamics (NLED) in the slow rotation regime a nu(mu),nu(tau)) and spin-flip (nu(l) -> nu(r), "l" stands for "left" and "r" stands for "right", change of neutrino handedness) mass level crossings, the equivalent to <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precessions.</b> Such analysis proves that in the spacetime of a slowly rotating nonlinear charged black hole (RNCBH), intrinsically associated with the assumption the electromagnetism is nonlinear, the neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae could be significantly changed. In such an astrophysical environment, a positive enhancement (reduction of the electron fraction Y-e < 0. 5) of the r-process may take place. Consequently, it might result in hyperluminous supernova explosions due to enlargement, in atomic number and amount, of the decaying nuclides. Finally, we envisage some physical scenarios that may lead to short-lived charged black holes with high charge-to-mass ratios (associated with unstable highly magnetized neutron stars) and ways to possibly disentangle theories of the electromagnetism from other black hole observables (by means of light polarization measurements) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to study {{the cause of a}} frequency-splitting {{phenomenon}} that occurs in a spinning Timoshenko beam. The associated changes {{in the structure of the}} progressive waves are investigated to shed light on the relationship between the wave motion in a spinning beam and the whirling of a shaft. The main result is that travelling bending waves in a beam spinning about its central axis have the topological structure of a revolving helix traced by the centroidal axis with right-handed or left-handed chirality. Each beam element behaves like a <b>gyroscopic</b> disc in <b>precession</b> being rotated at the wave frequency with anticlockwise or clockwise helicity. The gyroscopic effect is identified as the cause of the frequency splitting and is shown to induce a coupling between two interacting travelling waves lying in mutually orthogonal planes. Two revolving waves travelling in the same direction in space appear, one at a higher and one at a lower frequency compared with the pre-split frequency value. With reference to a given spinning speed, taken as clockwise, the higher one revolves clockwise and the lower one has anticlockwise helicity, each wave being represented by a characteristic four-component vector wavefunction. Two factors are identified as important, the shear-deformation factor q and the gyroscopic-coupling phase factor ?. The q-factor is related to the wavenumber and the geometric shape of the helical wave. The ?-factor is related to the wave helicity and has two values, +?/ 2 and ??/ 2 corresponding to the anticlockwise and clockwise helicity, respectively. The frequency-splitting phenomenon is addressed by analogy with other physical phenomena such as the Jeffcott whirling shaft and the property of the local energy equality of a travelling wave. The relationship between Euler's formula and the present result relating to the helical properties of the waves is also explored...|$|R

50|$|A Lomcovák (or {{incorrectly}} spelled Lomcevak) is {{a family}} of extreme aerobatic maneuvers where the aircraft, with almost no forward speed, rotates on chosen axes due to the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> and torque of the rotating propeller.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> - Used in the Antweight robot Gyrobot, {{as well as}} the Battlebots {{competitor}} Wrecks, {{this system}} uses a gyroscope and stationary feet that lift as the entire robot rotates due to <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> when the gyroscope is tilted by a servo motor. This design can use the gyroscope as a spinning weapon (horizontal or vertical) which allows for efficient double-usage of the gyroscope mass. Although Gyrobot and Wrecks appear to be walking as it translates across the arena, they're not classified as walking robots under current rules. This unusual drive train produces strange and often unpredictable movements, though has shown to be successful in combat.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} the inertia matrix and Newton's laws of motion is the analysis of a spinning top. This is discussed in the article on <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession.</b> A more detailed presentation {{can be found in}} the article on Euler's equations of motion.|$|E
5000|$|FASTRAND I had {{a single}} drum. The large mass of the {{rotating}} drum caused <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> of the unit, making it tend to spin on the computer room floor as the Earth rotated under it. Very few of these devices were delivered.|$|E
50|$|In later life, {{he became}} {{interested}} in gyroscopic physics and conducted experiments in gyroscopic motion.

McCabe claimed that his discovery could be used to reduce greenhouse gases, thereby reducing pollution.|$|E
50|$|When {{dissymmetry}} {{causes the}} retreating blade to experience less airflow than {{required to maintain}} lift, a condition called retreating blade stall can occur. This causes the helicopter to roll to the retreating side and pitch up (due to <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession).</b> This situation, when not immediately recognized can cause a severe loss of aircraft controllability.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{gyroscopes}} {{are used}} to cancel <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession,</b> the tendency of a gyroscope to twist {{at right angles to}} an input torque. By mounting a pair of gyroscopes (of the same rotational inertia and spinning at the same speed in opposite directions) at right angles the precessions are cancelled, and the platform will resist twisting.|$|E
50|$|Thus <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> is {{what makes}} the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly {{straight}} up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a Frisbee, but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.|$|E
5000|$|Flying a Lomcovak {{will vary}} in {{technique}} from aeroplane to aeroplane and pilot to pilot. Perhaps {{the most difficult}} thing about flying them is to use the throttle not as a speed control, but as a control of the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> and torque.

50|$|This {{maneuver}} demands {{there be}} no rolling at all but when airflow is minimal ailerons become ineffective. So {{as soon as the}} yaw is established reduce throttle to prevent the aircraft from rolling due to engine torque. Do not open the throttle again until the dive when sufficient airspeed has been gained for aileron control. Reduced throttle will also prevent <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> from pitching the nose up.|$|E
50|$|Any {{rotor system}} has a delay between {{the point in}} {{rotation}} where the controls introduce a change in pitch and {{the point where the}} desired change in the rotor blade's flight occurs. This difference is caused by phase lag, often confused with <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession.</b> A rotor is an oscillatory system that obeys the laws that govern vibration—which, depending on the rotor system, may resemble the behaviour of a gyroscope.|$|E
50|$|Gyro {{stabilizers}} {{consist of}} a spinning flywheel and <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> that imposes boat-righting torque on the hull structure.The angular momentum of the gyro’s flywheel {{is a measure of}} the extent to which the flywheel will continue to rotate about its axis unless acted upon by an external torque.

50|$|The {{approximate}} 2,150 {{years for}} each age {{corresponds to the}} average {{time it takes for}} the vernal equinox to move from one constellation of the zodiac into the next. This can be computed by dividing the earth's 25,800-year <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> period by twelve, the number of zodiac constellations used by astrologers. According to different astrologers' calculations, approximate dates for entering the Age of Aquarius range from AD 1447 (Terry MacKinnell) to AD 3597 (John Addey).|$|E
50|$|Since the gyrocompass's north-seeking {{function}} {{depends on}} the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession,</b> it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading indicators or directional gyros, which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} simplify the rotor head design, the Picoo Z does not feature either {{collective}} or user-input cyclic control, which would have allowed the user to freely fly it forwards & backwards / left & right on demand. The rotor blades are mounted on a simple rocking hinge, and the rotor has no swashplate.) Because of this limitation, the user must add left or right tail control inputs and rely on torque-induced precession (also known as <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession)</b> to transition to forward flight.|$|E
5000|$|A {{gyrocompass}} {{is a type}} of non-magnetic compass {{which is}} based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth (or another planetary body if used elsewhere in the universe) to find geographical direction automatically. Although one important component of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope, these are not the same devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession,</b> which is a distinctive aspect of the general gyroscopic effect. [...] Gyrocompasses are widely used for navigation on ships, because they have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses: ...|$|E
5000|$|Several British naval {{aircraft}} {{were adapted}} {{to carry a}} Palouste in a wing-mounted pod installation to facilitate engine starting when away from base. [...] A novel use of a surplus Palouste engine was its installation in a custom-built motorcycle known as the Boost Palouste. In 1986 this motorcycle broke an official ACU 1/4 mile speed record at 296 km/h). The builder modified the engine to include a primitive afterburner device and noted that pitch changes which occurred during braking and acceleration caused <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> handling effects due to the rotating mass of the engine.|$|E
50|$|A rolleron {{is a type}} of aileron {{used for}} rockets, placed at the {{trailing}} end of each fin, and used for passive stabilization against rotation. Inherent to the rolleron is a metal wheel with notches along the circumference. On one side, the notches protrude into the airflow. During flight, this will spin the wheels up to a substantial speed. The wheels then act as gyroscopes. Any tendency of the rocket to rotate along its major axis will be counteracted by the rollerons: the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> acts to move the rolleron in the opposite direction to the rotation.|$|E
50|$|In the {{discussion}} above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In {{the case of}} a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity - via the pitching motion - elicits <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.|$|E

50|$|A {{non-rotating}} body {{of planetary}} scale or larger would be pulled by gravity into a sphere. Virtually all bodies rotate, however. The centrifugal force deforms the body {{so that it}} has an equatorial bulge. Because of the bulge the gravitational force on the satellite is not directly {{toward the center of}} the central body, but is offset toward the equator. Whichever hemisphere the satellite is in it is preferentially pulled slightly toward the equator. This creates a torque on the orbit. This torque does not reduce the inclination; rather, it causes a torque-induced <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession,</b> which causes the orbital nodes to drift with time.|$|E
5000|$|Counter-rotating {{propellers}} {{are sometimes}} used on twin-, and other multi-engine, propeller-driven aircraft. The propellers of these wing-mounted engines turn {{in opposite directions}} from those on the other wing. Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed {{from the rear of}} the aircraft). Counter-rotating propellers generally spin clockwise on the left engine, and counter-clockwise on the right. The advantage of counter-rotating propellers is to balance out the torque effects of high-power piston engine as well as <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> effects (p-factor) during flight manoeuvres, eliminating the problem of the critical engine. These are sometimes referred to as [...] "handed" [...] propellers since there are left hand and right hand versions of each prop.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> {{causes the}} disc to rotate toward {{horizontal}} through its flight path. Unlike a right-side up throw, however, an upside-down disc will not precess toward a stable flat state, and will instead oscillate past horizontal {{and begin to}} bank in the opposite direction. This shuttlecock-like effect is known as [...] "helixing", and is generally avoided due to the difficulty in controlling a helixing flight path. For this reason, an upside down throw is typically released with either clockwise rotation and the left edge up, or counterclockwise rotation and the right edge up. The longer the disc is expected {{to remain in the}} air, the closer to vertical it must be at release to avoid the helixing effect.|$|E
50|$|Phase lag (rotorcraft) {{will cause}} the extra lift to be seen {{approximately}} 90 degrees later in rotor rotation in semi-rigid two bladed rotor systems. Phase lag is a separate phenomenon from <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession.</b> Phase lag is a property of all rotating systems acted upon by a periodic force. For systems hinged at the axis of rotation (in our case, a semi rigid flapping type rotor head) the phase lag is 90 degrees. For systems that are hinged at {{some distance from the}} axis of rotation (such as a fully articulated rotor head) the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. The pilot will experience either a right or left roll (see flight dynamics), depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.|$|E
5000|$|According to McCabe, {{there was}} power created from the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>precession</b> and he {{explored}} how to channel that power. McCabe's {{theory was that}} a spinning wheel shaped like a disc put into gyroscopic motion by {{a certain amount of}} torque could, in turn, produce an exponential amount of torque. McCabe discovered that when he used an air pressurizer to put 1.2 pounds per square inch (PSI) of torque into his gyroscopic wheel, it created 1,200 PSI of torque out. He also discovered the in-to-out relationship grew in an exponential manner and that by adding a second wheel, it put in 25 PSI, and the result was 4,200 PSI. McCabe was quoted as saying about his experiment: “If Isaac Newton ever saw this thing, the world would be a different place today.” ...|$|E
