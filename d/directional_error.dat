50|$|A rather simple {{hardware}} {{implementation of}} this guidance law {{can be found in}} early AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. These missiles use a rapidly rotating parabolic mirror as a seeker. Simple electronics detect the <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> the seeker has with its target (an IR source), and apply a moment to this gimballed mirror to keep it pointed at the target. Since the mirror is in fact a gyroscope it will keep pointing at the same direction if no external force or moment is applied, regardless of the movements of the missile. The voltage applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation. Although this does not result in a rotation rate that is always exactly proportional to the LOS-rate (which would require a constant airspeed), this implementation is equally effective.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is well {{established}} that elementary motion detectors are only able to code for the movement of a contour perpendicular to its orientation.

Here, we replicated this finding and asked whether this <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> can be reduced by subjects’ prediction of upcoming target moving direction and whether this <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> also occurs during tracking of an illusory contour. Our results show that prediction did not abolish the <b>directional</b> <b>error,</b> it was only slightly reduced.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of simultaneously testing many two-sided hypothe-ses when rejections of null hypotheses are accompanied by claims of {{the direction of the}} alternative. The fundamental goal is to construct methods that control the mixed <b>directional</b> familywise <b>error</b> rate, which is the probability of making any type 1 or type 3 (<b>directional)</b> 1 <b>error.</b> In particular, attention is focused on cases where the hypotheses are ordered as H 1; : : :; Hn, so that Hi+ 1 is tested only if H 1; : : :; Hi have all been previously rejected. In this situation, one can control the usual familywise error rate under arbitrary dependence by the basic procedure which tests each hypothesis at level, and no other multiplicity adjustment is needed. However, we show that this is far too liberal if one also accounts for <b>directional</b> <b>errors.</b> But, by imposing certain dependence assumptions on the test statistics, one can retain the basic procedure. ...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{auditory}} neglect attend less to auditory stimuli {{on their}} left and/or make systematic <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> when indicating sound positions. Rightward prismatic adaptation (R-PA) was repeatedly shown to alleviate symptoms of visuospatial neglect and once to restore partially spatial bias in dichotic listening. It is currently unknown whether R-PA affects only this ear-related symptom or also {{other aspects of}} auditory neglect. We have investigated the effect of R-PA on left ear extinction in dichotic listening, space-related inattention assessed by diotic listening, and <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> in auditory localization in patients with auditory neglect. The most striking effect of R-PA was the alleviation of left ear extinction in dichotic listening, which occurred in half of the patients with initial deficit. In contrast to nonresponders, their lesions spared the right dorsal attentional system and posterior temporal cortex. The beneficial effect of R-PA on an ear-related performance contrasted with detrimental effects on diotic listening and auditory localization. The former can be parsimoniously explained by the SHD-VAS model (shift in hemispheric dominance within the ventral attentional system; Clarke and Crottaz-Herbette 2016), {{which is based on}} the R-PA-induced shift of the right-dominant ventral attentional system to the left hemisphere.

The RDP asked children {{to look at}} and identify a target presented on a computer display in {{the presence or absence of}} a central, parafoveal or peripheral visual distractor (an angry, happy or neutral face). The results showed that symptoms of neuroticism were associated with hypervigilance for threat (i. e., slower latencies to initiate eye movements to the target in the presence of angry versus happy or neutral faces). In addition, when distractors were presented centrally, this relationship was most evident in children who reported lower levels of attentional control. Psychoticism traits were associated with increased selective attention to all distractors (as measured by <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> to face stimuli) and to child reported lower friendship quality. Moreover, the negative relationship between psychoticism and friendship characteristics associated with companionship was mediated via attentional capture of threat (i. e., a greater proportion of <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> to angry distractors).

Previous research has shown that right-handed novice golfers make rightward errors both in the perception of the perfect aiming line from the ball to the hole and in the putting action. Right-handed experts, however, produce accurate putting actions but tend to make leftward errors in perception. In two experiments, we examined whether these skill-related differences in <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> reflect transfer of calibration from action to perception. In the main experiment, three groups of right-handed novice participants followed a pretest, practice, posttest, retention test design.

In the implicit sequence learning condition participants performed a concurrent spatial cognitive task {{and in the}} two explicit conditions participants were required to discover the sequence order either {{with or without the}} concurrent cognitive task. Participants moved a cursor on the screen from the center location to one of the target locations projected in a semi-circle and back by shifting their center of pressure (CoP) on force plates.

40|$|Paediatric {{cerebral}} malaria {{is the most}} serious complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. While the majority recover, long-term cognitive impairment has been highlighted as a significant and neglected problem. Persistent or serious deficits in processes such as attention or behavioural inhibition should be manifest in changes to performance on oculomotor tasks. Therefore we investigated the impact of {{cerebral malaria}} on the development of reflexive pro-saccades and antisaccades. In a longitudinal study, 47 children previously admitted with retinopathy-confirmed cerebral malaria (mean age at admission 54 months), were compared with 37 local healthy controls (mean ages at first study visit 117 and 110 months respectively). In each of three or four test sessions, over a period of up to 32 months, participants completed 100 prosaccade tasks and 100 antisaccade tasks. Eye movements were recorded using infrared reflectance oculography; prosaccade, correct antisaccade and error prosaccade latency, and antisaccade <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> rate were calculated. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to investigate the effect of age and the influence of cerebral malaria on these parameters. Data were also collected from an independent, older group (mean age 183 months) of 37 local healthy participants in a separate cross-sectional study. Longitudinal data exhibited the expected decrease in latency with age for all saccade types, and a decrease in the antisaccade <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> rate. Hierarchical linear modelling confirmed that age had a statistically significant effect on all parameters (p< = 0. 001). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the cerebral malaria and control groups. Combining groups, comparison with the literature demonstrated that antisaccade <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> rate for the Malawi sample was significantly higher than expected, while latencies for all saccade types were indistinguishable from published. The high <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> rate was also confirmed in the older, healthy Malawian participants from the cross sectional study. Our observation of similar oculomotor performance in cerebral malaria and control groups at long follow-up periods suggests that cerebral malaria survivors are not at a generally increased risk of persistent cognitive deficits. Our data raise questions about the prevailing hypothesis that cerebral malaria has gross impacts on the development of processes such as attention and behavioural inhibition. More importantly, our novel finding of a clear difference in antisaccade performance between all of the Malawi participants and published data suggests that the Malawian paediatric population as a whole faces serious challenges to cognitive development beyond cerebral malaria...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of in-group relevance on inhibitory control in anti-saccades. In Experiment 1, following a central coloured cue, football fans were instructed to look at the target on pro-saccade trials or its mirrored position on anti-saccade trials. The targets were badges of participants’ favourite football team (in-group), its closest rival, or a non-local neutral team. Our results revealed no significant differences on pro-saccade trials for in- versus out-groups. However, on anti-saccade trials participants made more <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> for the in-group badge compared to the badges of the neutral and rival teams. Moreover, the percentage of <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> to in-group stimuli on anti-saccade trials was positively correlated with satisfaction toward the participant’s own team. Experiment 2, with separate blocks of pro- and anti-saccade and simple stimuli replicated the results of Experiment 1. Experiment 3, was conducted to test the effects of familiarity on the performance in pro- and anti-saccade tasks using items with no group relevance. Our results revealed that familiarity of the items with no group relevance did not modulate inhibitory control in anti-saccade trials. Further, Experiment 4 showed that for participants who did not have any interest in football the performance in anti-saccades did not differ for different football teams. Overall, our findings suggest that under conditions of real-world intergroup rivalry in-group relevance modulates inhibitory control over anti-saccades. Future studies should seek to unravel the mechanisms contributing to the effects of group relevance on inhibitory control...|$|R

40|$|Forty-seven normal {{subjects}} performed two-dimensional arm movements on a digitizer board using a mouse device. The {{movements were}} projected {{on a computer}} monitor. Subjects were instructed to move the mouse using the whole arm from a center position to a peripheral target so that the projected movement would pass over the target without stopping on the target. A large number of targets (360) were used to cover the entire directional continuum. The direction of the arm movement was the parameter of interest, which was measured at an initial position, at {{one third of the}} distance towards the target, and at the vicinity of the target. Four conditions of delay between target presentation and movement execution were used (0, 2, 4, 6 s). A systematic <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> was observed at the initial portion of the trajectory. This error resulted from a clustering of movement directions on an axis that was perpendicular to the axis of the resting forearm before movement onset. This pattern of errors {{can be explained by the}} initial inertial anisotropy of the arm. As the trajectory evolved, a different <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> emerged, resulting from a clustering of movement directions in two orthogonal axes. This pattern of <b>directional</b> <b>error</b> increased in amplitude as the delay increased, in contrast to the error at the initial portion of the trajectory which remained invariant with increasing delay. Finally, the information transmitted by the movement direction was shown to increase with the evolution of the trajectory. The increase in delay resulted in a decrease in directional-information transmission. Tt is proposed that the directional bias towards the end of the movement trajectory might reflect the action of "movement primitives", that is patterns of muscle activation resulting from spinal interneuronal activation. It is further proposed that the directional bias observed at the vicinity of the target might reflect a loss of cortical directional information with increasing delay between target presentation and movement onset...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{previous}} studies, {{we provided}} {{evidence for a}} directional distortion of the endpoints of movements to memorized target locations. This distortion was similar to a perceptual distortion in direction discrimination known as the oblique effect so we named it the ‘‘motor oblique effect’’. In this report we analyzed the <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> during {{the evolution of the}} movement trajectory in memory guided and visually guided pointing movements and compared them with <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> in a perceptual experiment of arrow pointing. We observed that the motor oblique effect was present in the evolving trajectory of both memory and visually guided reaching movements. In memory guided pointing the motor oblique effect did not disappear during trajectory evolution while in visually guided pointing the motor oblique effect disappeared with decreasing distance from the target and was smaller in magnitude compared to the perceptual oblique effect and the memory motor oblique effect early on after movement initiation. The motor oblique effect in visually guided pointing increased when reaction time was small and dis-appeared with larger reaction times. The results are best explained using the hypothesis that a low level oblique effect is present for visually guided pointing movements and this effect is corrected by a mechanism that does not depend on visual feedback from the trajectory evolution and might even be completed during movement planning. A second cognitive oblique effect is added in the percep-tual estimation of direction and affects the memory guided pointing movements. It is finally argued that the motor oblique effect can be a useful probe for the study of per-ception–action interaction...|$|R

Within 10 days following mild CHI (Glasgow Coma Scale 1315, alteration of consciousness < 20 min), we compared 30 patients (15 - 37 years) and 30 matched controls on different types of saccades, oculomotor smooth pursuit (sine and random), upper-limb visuomotor performance and several neuropsychological tests known {{to be sensitive to}} head trauma. Simple reflexive saccades were not impaired, whereas, on the antisaccade task, the CHI group demonstrated prolonged saccadic latencies, a marginally higher number of <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> and poorer spatial accuracy. The CHI group exhibited more <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> and impaired motor accuracy on memory-guided sequences of saccades and produced fewer self-paced saccades within 30 s. Most measures of sinusoidal and random oculomotor smooth pursuit showed no deficits, {{with the exception of a}} prolonged lag on random smooth pursuit in the CHI group. While arm movement reaction time and arm steadiness were not impaired, the CHI group showed decreased arm movement speed and decreased upper-limb motor accuracy. Conversely, after controlling for IQ, the CHI group had few head trauma-related neuropsychological deficits. These results indicate that multiple motor systems can be impaired following mild CHI and that this can occur independently of neuropsychological impairment. Our study also indicates that quantitative tests of oculomotor and upper-limb visuomotor function may provide sensitive markers of cerebral dysfunction, suggesting the potential use of such tests to supplement patient assessment.

Results of the DFW and FD approaches were compared with data obtained with standard compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. RESULTS: Relative to standard CS, <b>directional</b> <b>errors</b> of vector fields and divergence were reduced by 55 - 60...|$|R
