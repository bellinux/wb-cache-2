Tertiary care center settings and lack of control for comorbidity may contribute to this discrepancy. Referral to angiography was examined in a population based cohort of 413 men and 191 women who had a <b>first</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> in 1987 in Olmsted County MN. At study entry, women were older (55 ± 17 years vs 48 ± 14 years old for men) {{and more likely to}} have typical angina (38 % vs 29 % of men), hypertension (37 % vs 30 % of men), or a family history of coronary artery disease (72 % vs 59 % of men) (p< 0. 05). The exercise test was more frequently positive in women (19 %) than in men (12 %) (p= 0. 023). There was no gender difference in absolute percentages of referral to angiography: 18 % in women and 17 % in men (p= 0. 80).

40|$|BACKGROUND Slowed {{heart rate}} {{recovery}} (HRR) {{of less than}} 12 beats per minute in the first minute after an exercise <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> has been suggested as a useful addition to the criteria currently used to assess exercise <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> results. Although HRR has been tested in large populations, the short-term test-retest sta-bility (reproducibility) of abnormal HRR for an individual has not been assessed. METHODS The study was a retrospective comparison of medical record informa-tion using a community-practice–based sample of 90 patients undergoing 2 exer-cise <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> separated by 18 weeks or less. Concordance of abnormal HRR results on the <b>first</b> and second <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> were assessed for individual patients using definitions of abnormal HRR from the medical literature. RESULTS Individual patient’s HRR was markedly variable from the <b>first</b> to second <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> In this sample, no definition of abnormal HRR provided more than 55 % concordance between results from the <b>first</b> and second <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> CONCLUSION These preliminary data suggest that HRR appears to have limited short-term test-retest stability or reproducibility and therefore {{might not be a}} reli-able addition to current results of exercise <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Ann Fam Med 2003; 1 : 236 - 241.

40|$|BackgroundAccording to European guidelines, {{patients}} with stable coronary disease should undergo moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Intense physical activity {{may have a}} negative impact on platelet aggregation and the protective effect of antiplatelet (AP) drugs is not documented. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of aspirin (ASA) and P 2 Y 12 receptors antagonists (P 2 Y 12 -RA), before and immediately after intense physical activity. MethodsWe performed a prospective single center cross-over study. Patients had to be treated with dual AP therapy including ASA and P 2 Y 12 -RA (Clopidogrel or Prasugrel), at least 6 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but less than the recommended one year, in the absence of significant left ventricular sequelae or residual ischemia. A <b>first</b> <b>Stress</b> <b>test</b> was done with ASA and Clopidogrel or Prasugrel, then, after 2 weeks, the P 2 Y 12 -RA was switched (Prasugrel instead of Clopidogrel and vice versa) and a second Stress test was performed. Platelet responses were analyzed by Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) and P 2 Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU) measurements, before and immediately after Stress test. Results 23 patients (all men; mean age 57, 7 years) undertaking dual AP therapy (ASA- 75 mg plus Prasugrel- 10 mg or ASA- 75 mg plus Clopidogrel- 75 mg per day) were recruited. Mean Peak Activity reached was 164, 8 Watts. Mean exercise duration was 11. 5 minutes. Mean Maximal Heart Rate reached was 135 beats per minute. Before and after effort: PRU (reference range< 235) was 124, 5 and 112, 8 (p= 0, 5) and 56, 7 and 54, 8 (p= 0, 8) respectively with Clopidrogrel and Prasugrel; ARU (reference range< 550) was 433, 2 and 398. 7 (p= 0, 01). ConclusionIn patients treated after an ACS, inhibitory effects of dual AP therapy are not modified during physical activity. The inhibitory effect of ASA seems even better immediately after a stress test. This is for a resumption of intense physical activity after six months...|$|E
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in management after stress tests have been documented, possibly reflecting gender bias. Whether these differences impact on long-term outcome {{is not known}} but is critical to assess appropriateness of care. We conducted a retrospective population based cohort study of 604 persons (413 men, 191 women) who had a <b>first</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> in 1987 in Olmsted County MN with complete follow up until 1994 or death. At study entry, women were older(55 ± 17 years oldvs 48 ± 14 years old for men) {{and more likely to}} have typical angine (38 % vs 29 % of men), hypertension (37 % vs 30 % of men), a family history of coronary artery disease (72 % vs 59 % of men), and a positive stress test (19 % vs 12 % of men) (p< 0. 05). The frequency and relative risks (RR) of cardiac event (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure cardiac death) with and without inclusion of revascularization (revasc) and overall death were:WomenMenRR 95 % CICardiac event 14 (7 %) 36 (9 %) 0. 80. 4 to 1. 5 Cardiac event incl revasc 18 (9 %) 66 (16 %) 0. 50. 3 to 0. 9 Overall death 16 (8 %) 19 (5 %) 1. 70. 9 to 3. 4 After adjusting for history of myocardial infarction, symptoms, age, stress test results and comorbidity, no gender difference in risk of death was seen. Women with a negative stress test were at a lower risk of cardiac event (RR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 16 to 1. 0); when revascularization was included as cardiac event, the relative risk was lower in women than in men (RR 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 to 0. 6). ConclusionThese population based data suggest that there is no excess risk of overall death, cardiac death or myocardial infarction in women. The risk of cardiac event including revascularization, however, was lower in women: this may represent underutilization of revascularization in women or overutilization in men...|$|E

40|$|Background Whilst {{acute stress}} {{paradigms}} in adults {{make use of}} adult panel members, similar paradigms modified for child participants have not manipulated the panel. Most work has utilised an audience of adult confederates, regardless {{of the age of}} the population being tested. The aim {{of this study was to}} trial a social <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> for children that provided a meaningful environment using age-matched child peers as panel actors. Methods Thirty-three participants (7 - 11 years) underwent the Bath Experimental Stress Test for Children (BEST-C). Based on the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), it comprises a shortened six-minute public speaking task and four-minute maths challenge. It differs from previous <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> by using age-matched children on the panel, pre-recorded and presented as a live feed, and includes an expanded manipulation check of subjective experience. Salivary cortisol was assessed at four time points, pre–post stress testing; life events, daily hassles and coping strategies were measured through questionnaires. A simple numerical coding scheme was applied to post-test interview data. Results The BEST-C generated a typical stress and adaptation response in salivary cortisol (p=. 032). Age and gender differences were observed during recovery. Cortisol responses mapped directly onto three distinct subjective response patterns: i) expected response and recovery; ii) expected response, no recovery; iii) no response. Conclusions The BEST-C, utilising child confederates of participant target age is a meaningful social <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> for children. This is the <b>first</b> social <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> developed specifically for children that manipulates panel characteristics by using child confederates and a pre-recorded sham panel.

50|$|A bank <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> is a {{simulation}} {{based on an}} examination of the balance sheet of that institution. Large international banks began using internal <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> in the early 1990s. In 1996, the Basel Capital Accord was amended to require banks and investment firms to conduct <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> to determine their ability to respond to market events. However, up until 2007, <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> were typically performed only by the banks themselves, for internal self-assessment. Beginning in 2007, governmental regulatory bodies became interested in conducting their own <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> to insure the effective operation of financial institutions. Since then, <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> have been routinely performed by financial regulators in different countries or regions, to insure that the banks under their authority are engaging in practices likely to avoid negative outcomes. In India, legislation was enacted in 2007 requiring banks to undergo regular <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> In October 2012, U.S. regulators unveiled new rules expanding this practice by requiring the largest American banks to undergo <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators. Starting in 2014 midsized firms (i.e., those with $10-50 billion in assets) are also being required to conduct Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing.In 2012, federal regulators also began recommending portfolio <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> as a sound risk management practice for community banks or institutions that were too small to fall under Dodd-Frank's requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in an October 18, 2012, Bulletin recommends <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> as means to identify and quantify loan portfolio risk. The FDIC made similar recommendations for community banks.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> for {{diagnosis}} of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) are incompletely sensitive and specific. Objective: We examined the frequency of significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain {{who have had a}} recent negative or inconclusive (< 85 % of predicted maximum heart rate) cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients identified from ED and cardiology registries at the study hospital. We included patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain, with a negative cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> {{in the past three years}} as the last cardiac test, and hospital admission. One-hundred sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Their admission was reviewed for {{diagnosis of}} CAD by positive serum troponin, percutaneous coronary intervention, or positive <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> while an inpatient. Results: Of 164 patients, 122 (74. 4 %, 95 % CI 67. 7, 81. 1) had a negative <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> prior to the index admission, while 42 (25. 6 %, 95 % CI 18. 9, 32. 3) had otherwise normal but inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Thirty-four (20. 7 %, 95 % CI 14. 4, 27. 0) of the included patients were determined to have CAD. Twenty-five of the 122 patients (20. 5 %, 95 % CI 13. 3, 27. 7) had negative pre-admission <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> and nine of 42 patients (21. 4 %, 95 % CI 9. 0, 33. 8) had inclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> of CAD. A statistical comparison between these two proportions showed no significant difference (p =. 973). Conclusion: Due to inadequate sensitivity, negative non-invasive cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> should not be used to rule out CAD. Patients with negative <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> are just as likely to have CAD as patients with inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> [West J Emerg Med 2010; 11 (4) : 384 - 388. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increased financial instability {{in many countries}} in the 1990 s, policy makers became interested in better understanding vulnerabilities in financial systems, and particularly in banks. One of the key techniques for quantifying vulnerabilities is <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> This article reviews the literature on <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> of banking systems. The first section introduces the concept of <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> The second section overviews <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> performed by international financial institutions, central banks, and other researchers. The third section describes the implementation of <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> The fourth section discusses specific issues relating to individual shock factors. The fifth section provides a conclusion. 1. The Concept of Macroprudential <b>Stress</b> <b>Testing</b> In the context of financial sector analysis, the term <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> refers {{to a range of}} techniques used to help assess the vulnerability of financial institutions or the financial system to exceptional but plausible events. 1 <b>Stress</b> <b>tests</b> were originally developed for use at the portfolio level, to understand how the value of a portfolio changes if there are large changes to its risk factors (such as asset prices). They have become widely used as a risk management tool by financial institutions. 2 In recent years, the techniques have started to be applied in a broader context, with the aim of measuring the sensitivity of a group of financial institutions or even an entire financial system to common shocks. This article focuses on macroprudential (system-focused) <b>stress</b> <b>tests,</b> which are based on applying a common set of shocks and scenarios to a set of financial institutions, in order to analyze both the aggregate impact and the distribution of the impact across the institutions. Compared to <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> for individual institutions, the macroprudential <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> hav...|$|R
