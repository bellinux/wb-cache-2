5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian <b>gasket,</b> {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This <b>gasket</b> is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian <b>gasket</b> was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian <b>gasket</b> also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian <b>gasket,</b> {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E
5|$|The {{second novel}} in the Alexis Carew series, Mutineer, by J. A. Sutherland, takes {{nearly the entire}} account of the mutiny, down to the <b>gasket</b> being a source of {{contention}} for Midshipman Carew, {{and puts it in}} a science fiction setting involving a futuristic HMS Hermione under the command of a Captain Neals. In the novel, Carew takes the place of Midshipman Casey. Neals demonstrates his cruelty in the same fashion as Pigot. Neals orders Carew to kneel and beg for forgiveness, and he disrates her and has her flogged when she refuses.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a <b>gasket</b> material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a <b>gasket.</b> The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of <b>gasket</b> material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the fractal {{characterization}} of the sealing surface topography of metallic <b>gaskets</b> was studied. The influence of the compressive stress on the fractal parameters was also investigated. It’s found that the sealing surface of metallic <b>gaskets</b> is fractal, and its topography can be characterized by the fractal dimension and the scale coefficient. The leakage model of metallic <b>gaskets</b> was established. The research {{results indicate that the}} larger the fractal dimension is, and the less the scale coefficient and the non-contact area are, the better the sealing performance of metallic <b>gaskets</b> is...|$|R

5|$|In March 1901 the {{battleship}} grounded again, {{this time in}} the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the Maine. Another accident happened in August of that year, when Massachusetts grounded on a rock in Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard Massachusetts: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken <b>gasket</b> caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906 {{the battleship}} was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship Indiana, which had completed a three-year modernization. Massachusetts now received the same upgrades, including twelve 3"/50 caliber gun single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock & Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a lattice mast and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a <b>gasket,</b> one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E
25|$|If two {{different}} curvatures are repeated {{within the first}} five, the <b>gasket</b> will have D2 symmetry; such a symmetry consists of two reflections (perpendicular to each other) along diameters of the bounding circle, with a two-fold rotational symmetry of 180°.

50|$|Garlock {{is a large}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>gaskets</b> that contain chrysotile asbestos. Garlock stamps its name prominently on its products making it famous among the workers who install and replace its <b>gaskets.</b> Garlock's <b>gaskets</b> were installed in pipes, valves, and flanges which were in turn covered in heavy fire-retardant insulation that also contained asbestos but was manufactured by other parties. The asbestos contained by Garlock products is encased in a polymer-like substance. Garlock products only emit asbestos fibers when cut or struck heavily, usually during removal. Removing such <b>gaskets</b> would necessarily require first removing the insulation covering them which would also release asbestos. The chrysotile asbestos used in Garlock's <b>gaskets</b> is roughly 1/100 to 1/2000 as carcinogenic as the friable amphibole asbestos used in the insulating tape just mentioned. Over a thirty-five year period Garlock was sued {{hundreds of thousands of}} times and forced to pay about $1.3 billion in judgements, settlements, and defense costs. Garlock exhausted its insurance coverage in 2010.|$|R

25|$|If {{none of the}} curvatures are {{repeated}} within the first five, the <b>gasket</b> contains no symmetry, which is represented by symmetry group C1; the <b>gasket</b> described by curvatures (−10,18,23,27) is an example.|$|E

25|$|A <b>gasket</b> used in {{a diamond}} anvil cell {{experiment}} is a thin metal foil, typically 0.3mm in thickness, which is placed in between the diamonds. Desirable materials for gaskets are strong, stiff metals such as rhenium or tungsten. Steel is frequently used as a cheaper alternative for low pressure experiments. The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the x-ray beam must pass through the <b>gasket.</b> They are not transparent to x-rays, and thus if x-ray illumination through the <b>gasket</b> is required then lighter materials, such as beryllium, boron nitride, boron or diamond are used as a <b>gasket.</b> Gaskets are preindented by the diamonds and a hole is drilled {{in the center of}} the indentation to create the sample chamber.|$|E

25|$|If {{two of the}} {{original}} generating circles have the same radius and the third circle has a radius that is two-thirds of this, then the Apollonian <b>gasket</b> has two lines of reflective symmetry; one line is the line joining the centres of the equal circles; the other is their mutual tangent, which passes through {{the centre of the}} third circle.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an accelerate aging procedure used for investigating the surface alteration of PTFE <b>gaskets</b> commercialized by two alternative producers.

A possible explanation could be represented by the presence of unexpected chemical compounds emerging from the disaggregation of highly reacting elements from the tire composition. In particular, it is believed that the unpredicted combination of fluorides and chlorides could explain the violent chemical attack highlighted on steel tanks and on their <b>gaskets.</b> But no evidence exists. Thus, the experimental characterization of PTFE properties has to follow an appropriate accelerated aging, aiming at actuating the specific mechanics of wearing as in industrial use...|$|R
