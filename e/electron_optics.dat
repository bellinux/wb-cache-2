It has brought new quantities called electronic coherences under the spotlight. In this paper, we explore the relations between <b>electron</b> quantum <b>optics</b> and signal processing through a global review of the various methods for accessing single- and two-electron coherences in <b>electron</b> quantum <b>optics.</b> We interpret <b>electron</b> quantum <b>optics</b> interference experiments as analog signal processing converting quantum signals into experimentally observable quantities such as current averages and correlations. This point of view also gives us a procedure to obtain quantum information quantities from <b>electron</b> quantum <b>optics</b> coherences.

In this way, bunches containing up to 1 pC are created, allowing for single shot recording of diffraction patterns, whilst retaining the desired spatial and temporal resolution. Dynamics, induced in the sample by pumping with a fs pump laser pulse give rise to changes in the sample structure. These changes are monitored by recording diffraction patterns with the electron bunch. This report gives an overview of the improvements implemented in the setup. The effect of fluctuations in the charge per electron bunch was reduced by calibrating and monitoring the photoemission process. The <b>electron</b> beam <b>optics</b> were carefully aligned to guarantee the quality of diffraction patterns. Several diagnostic techniques were implemented to monitor the parameters relevant for pump-probe UED measurements. It is demonstrated that all these improvements together have led to a stability of order 1 % in the recording of diffraction patterns. As these fluctuations are much smaller than the expected effects of the dynamic processes under investigation, it is concluded that pump-probe measurements should now in principle be possible with this setup. To test the pump-probe capabilities, the heating mechanism of graphite was investigated. For this, graphite samples as thin as 30 nm were produced through mechanical exfoliation.
