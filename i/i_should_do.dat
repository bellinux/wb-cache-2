500|$|During 1965, Dylan {{composed}} prose, poems, {{and songs}} by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{began as a}} long piece of [...] "vomit" [...] (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called {{the creation of the}} song a [...] "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing [...] "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>do...</b> After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents."

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> all that he has done and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> all that I know he has in mind to do'.|$|E
