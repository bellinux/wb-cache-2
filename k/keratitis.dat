5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, <b>keratitis,</b> corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with <b>keratitis</b> and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and <b>keratitis.</b> Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and <b>keratitis.</b> This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of <b>keratitis,</b> which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, <b>keratitis,</b> in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

25|$|Keratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of conjunctivitis and <b>keratitis</b> (corneal inflammation).|$|E
25|$|A {{large segment}} of current contact lens {{research}} is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend {{to agree that the}} most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial <b>keratitis</b> and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial <b>keratitis</b> associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the Staphylococcus species (aureus and epidermidis) and the Streptococcus species, among others. Microbial <b>keratitis</b> is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.|$|E
25|$|Short-term damage {{includes}} solar <b>keratitis,</b> {{which is}} similar to sunburn of the cornea. Symptoms usually occur within twenty-four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Exophthalmos is {{a normal}} {{condition}} in brachycephalic (short nosed) dog breeds because of the shallow orbit. However, {{it can lead to}} <b>keratitis</b> secondary to exposure of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and <b>keratitis.</b> It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} shows a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva, {{which is}} easily mistaken for the ciliary infection of iris (iritis), {{but there are}} usually corroborative signs on microscopy, particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, and sometimes a punctate <b>keratitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcer, or {{ulcerative}} <b>keratitis,</b> is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} cornea involving loss of its outer layer. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichia, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.|$|E
25|$|From the age {{of three}} to seven, Piaf was {{allegedly}} blind as a result of <b>keratitis.</b> According to one of her biographers, she recovered her sight after her grandmother's prostitutes pooled money to accompany her on a pilgrimage honouring Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Piaf claimed this {{was the result of a}} miraculous healing.|$|E
25|$|Aciclovir topical {{cream is}} {{commonly}} associated (≥1% of patients) with: dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include erythema or itch. When {{applied to the}} eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), ophthalmic aciclovir is associated with superficial punctate <b>keratitis</b> or allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{generally}} safe {{as long as}} they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly. Improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, and, most of all, the whole structure of the cornea. Poor lens care can lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and Acanthamoeba (Acanthamoeba <b>keratitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin is {{approved}} by the FDA to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as an ophthalmic emulsion for the treatment of dry eyes (a common symptom of Sjögren's syndrome), and as a treatment for persistent nummular <b>keratitis</b> following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms {{cutaneous}} and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, {{which most}} commonly affect {{the face and}} neck. Indeed, the fungus was originally isolated from {{the skin of a}} patient with lesions on their cheek, neck, and ear. Cells isolated from cutaneous infections are often spherical, and may form toruloid or moniliform chains. Exophiala dermatitidis has been implicated various superficial infections including onychomycosis, otitis externa, and eye infections causing <b>keratitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A corneal ulcer, or {{ulcerative}} <b>keratitis,</b> is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} cornea involving loss of its outer layer. It is very common in dogs and is sometimes seen in cats. In veterinary medicine, the term corneal ulcer is a generic name for any condition involving {{the loss of the}} outer layer of the cornea, and as such is used to describe conditions with both inflammatory and traumatic causes.|$|E
25|$|There is low-quality {{evidence}} suggesting that interferon eye drops may be an effective treatment {{for people who have}} herpes simplex virus epithelial <b>keratitis,</b> a type of eye infection. There is no clear evidence to suggest that removing the infected tissue (debridement) followed by interferon drops is an effective treatment approach for these types of eye infections. Low-quality evidence suggests that the combination of interferon and an antiviral agent may speed the healing process compared to antiviral therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to <b>keratitis</b> and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|Soft lenses {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They {{are used in the}} treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, <b>keratitis,</b> corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|Setosphaeria rostrata is a {{thermophilic}} fungus with an asexual reproductive form {{treated in the}} genus Exserohilum (as Exserohilum rostratum). This fungus is a common plant pathogen, causing leaf spots as well as crown rot and root rot in grasses. It {{is also found in}} soils and on textiles in subtropical and tropical regions. Exserohilum rostratum is one of the 35 Exserohilum species implicated uncommonly as opportunistic pathogens of humans where it is an etiologic agent of sinusitis, <b>keratitis</b> and CNS vasculitis as well as cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses. Infections caused by Exserohilum are most often seen in regions with hot climates particularly Israel, India and Southern USA.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{and other}} retinoids {{are well known}} to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during {{treatment}} and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (<b>keratitis),</b> swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{cause for}} initial ulceration is not commonly found, although {{in many cases}} it can be assumed to be traumatic in origin. The horse's eye is especially vulnerable to trauma due to its prominent position, compared with other species. Exposure <b>keratitis</b> (inflamed cornea) can occur in the horse, most commonly secondary to facial nerve paralysis. Hospitalised animals {{have been shown to}} have a decreased corneal reflex, and this corresponds to an increased incidence of ulcers in the hospitalised population. Foreign bodies embedded in the palpebral conjunctiva or the nictitating membrane can cause persistent irritation and ulceration. Often the shape and distribution of the lesion is suggestive of this aetiology, but {{even in the absence of}} a characteristic lesion their presence should be considered and sought out.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic <b>keratitis</b> (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial <b>keratitis</b> is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft CLs. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel CLs than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.|$|E
25|$|Small {{peptides}} can specifically {{inhibit the}} RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when {{they share a}} significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal <b>keratitis</b> and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 {{has been reported to}} inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV.|$|E
500|$|HSV {{infection}} causes several distinct medical disorders. [...] Common {{infection of}} the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (herpetic whitlow). [...] More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye (herpes <b>keratitis),</b> or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis). [...] People with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or people with AIDS, [...] are prone to severe complications from HSV infections. HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are more}} serious {{conditions}} that can present {{with a red}} eye such as infectious <b>keratitis,</b> angle-closure glaucoma, or iritis. These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist. Signs of such conditions include decreased vision, significantly increased sensitivity to light, inability to keep eye open, a pupil that does not respond to light, or a severe headache with nausea. Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge. [...] Mild photophobia is common. [...] However, {{if any of these}} symptoms are prominent, {{it is important to consider}} other diseases such as glaucoma, uveitis, <b>keratitis</b> and even meningitis or carotico-cavernous fistula.|$|E
2500|$|... flap {{complications}} The {{incidence of}} flap complications is about 0.244%. Flap complications (such as displaced flaps or folds in the flaps that necessitate repositioning, diffuse lamellar <b>keratitis,</b> and epithelial ingrowth) {{are common in}} lamellar corneal surgeries but rarely lead to permanent loss of visual acuity. The incidence of these microkeratome-related complications decreases with increased physician experience.|$|E
2500|$|FHV-1 {{also has}} a predilection for corneal epithelium, {{resulting}} in corneal ulcers, often pinpoint or dendritic in shape. [...] Other ocular signs of FHV-1 infection include conjunctivitis, <b>keratitis,</b> keratoconjunctivitis sicca (decreased tear production), and corneal sequestra. [...] Infection of the nasolacrimal duct can result in chronic epiphora (excess tearing). [...] Ulcerative skin disease can also result from FHV-1 infection. [...] FHV-1 can also cause abortion in pregnant queens, usually at the sixth week of gestation, although {{this may be due}} to systemic effects of the infection rather than the virus directly.|$|E
2500|$|Diffuse {{lamellar}} <b>keratitis</b> [...] {{an inflammatory}} process that involves {{an accumulation of}} white blood cells at the interface between the LASIK corneal flap and the underlying stroma. It is known colloquially as [...] "sands of Sahara syndrome" [...] because on slit lamp exam, the inflammatory infiltrate appears similar to waves of sand. The USAeyes organisation reports an incidence of 2.3% after LASIK. It is most commonly treated with steroid eye drops. Sometimes {{it is necessary for}} the eye surgeon to lift the flap and manually remove the accumulated cells. DLK has not been reported with photorefractive keratectomy due to the absence of flap creation.|$|E
