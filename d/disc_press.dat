50|$|With World War I various {{materials}} used in Edison Discs came in short supply, and many <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> during the war were made hastily and with inferior materials, notably a reformulated phenolic finishing varnish that was introduced when European chemical supplies were cut off. This resulted in problems with surface noise even on new records, and Edison's market share shrank.|$|R
5000|$|Of more {{specialist}} interest (but {{bringing us}} closer to Tamagno in recording quality) has been a 2007 release of all of Tamagno's extant 12-inch records on high quality vinyl <b>discs</b> (<b>pressed</b> from the original metal [...] "masters"/parts found in a German archive) by the United Kingdom firm Historic Masters. This was followed in 2012 by all the ten inch recordings.|$|R
50|$|When a {{substantial}} number of copies of an electrical transcription were required, as for the distribution of a syndicated program, they were produced by the same process used to make ordinary records. A master recording was cut, then electroplated to produce a stamper from which pressings in vinyl (or, in the case of transcription <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> before about 1935, shellac) were molded in a record press.|$|R
50|$|Pressings {{were created}} {{in the same way}} as {{ordinary}} records. A master recording was cut into a blank wax or acetate disc. This was electroplated to produce a metal stamper from which a number of identical <b>discs</b> were <b>pressed</b> in shellac or vinyl in a record press. Although the earliest transcription <b>discs</b> were <b>pressed</b> in shellac, in the mid-1930s quieter vinyl compounds were substituted. These discs were used to distribute syndicated programming to individual radio stations. Their use for this purpose persisted long after the advent of magnetic tape recording because it was cheaper to cut and plate a master <b>disc</b> and <b>press</b> 100 identical high-quality discs than to make 100 equally high-quality tape dubs.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{transcription}} <b>discs</b> were <b>pressed</b> only in shellac, but by 1932 pressings in RCA Victor's vinyl-based [...] "Victrolac" [...] were appearing. Other plastics {{were sometimes}} used. By the late 1930s, vinyl was standard {{for nearly all}} kinds of <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> except ordinary commercial 78s, which continued {{to be made of}} shellac.|$|R
50|$|On 16 February 2012, {{speculation}} {{over the}} potential {{release of a}} re-mastered live album was laid to rest when Silly Wizard Live Again (BCD619) went on sale exclusively through bass player Martin Hadden's company Birnam CD. Hadden had overseen the reissue project. The packaging was designed and the <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> by Birnam CD. As of 2016 many of their albums, including the re-mastered live album, were available on iTunes.|$|R
5000|$|The single reached number 52 on the UK singles charts on 10 September 1988. Go! <b>Discs</b> <b>pressed</b> a [...] "DJ edit" [...] promo {{with the}} first verse removed without Bragg's prior {{knowledge}} and to his subsequent displeasure. As well as the UK release from Go! Discs there were releases in Australia and New Zealand on Liberation Records and in Germany on Line Records. Elektra Records in the USA produced a 12" [...] promo.|$|R
5000|$|Radiex {{records were}} standard, lateral-cut, {{double-sided}} 78 rpm <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> in various colours of shellac which generally wore down easily. The earliest paper sleeves in which Radiex records were sold described them as [...] "The Record of Beauty." [...] The issues are popular vocal and dance {{numbers of the}} era, from masters recorded by Grey Gull, Plaza Music, Emerson Records, and sometimes Paramount Records. The Radiex label was discontinued (on 78 r.p.m. discs) in 1931 ...|$|R
50|$|The label {{was put out}} by National Music Lovers Incorporated of New York City. The records, {{issued from}} 1920 through 1928, was sold via mail order, eight records for three dollars. All the {{recordings}} were apparently done by other record companies, with masters leased and <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> by National Music Lovers. Issues include recordings originally made by Pathé, Emerson, Banner, and other labels. On {{most if not all}} National Music Lovers discs the original artists are listed under pseudonyms.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its initial}} release, Auto Racing used a [...] "directional" [...] {{steering}} mechanic, where players <b>pressed</b> the <b>disc</b> {{to steer the}} car towards a screen direction. For example to steer the car south on the playfield, {{the bottom of the}} <b>disc</b> is <b>pressed.</b> The amount of steering depends on where the 16 position <b>disc</b> is <b>pressed.</b> After receiving a number of complaints, Mattel revised the game with a [...] "realistic" [...] steering mechanic, where to make left turns {{the left side of the}} <b>disc</b> is <b>pressed,</b> and for right turns the right side of the <b>disc</b> is <b>pressed.</b> The point on the disc for hard turns stays consistent regardless of the car's orientation. No reference was made on the game's packaging to indicate which steering mechanic that particular cartridge used, with the instructions inside the package indicating the version to be used. The programmer did include the preferred [...] "realistic" [...] steering in the original release as a hidden option. [...] The hidden feature is enabled by holding 1+6+9 on the controller keypad during system start/reset. The option is per controller. The revised cartridge does not have any hidden option.|$|R

50|$|The band {{started in}} 2002 as a casual project for 5 high school friends, {{practicing}} in basement of drummer Patrick Birtles parents' house. After playing {{a handful of}} local shows in Edmonton at various all-ages venues, the band recorded the 'Your Famous Last Words' EP with friend and current Shout Out Out Out Out member Nik Kozub. The EP was a 5-song <b>disc</b> <b>pressed</b> by the band members and sold at shows. The band began playing shows across Western Canada and eventually committed their next release to local Edmonton independent record label 'Farway Records'.|$|R
5000|$|Of the ten {{songs on}} the album, a more pop version of [...] "左右手 (My Left and Right Hands)" [...] was {{previously}} included on the Leslie Cheung tribute album, ReImagine Leslie Cheung released by Universal Music Hong Kong earlier in the year. The first printing of this album had the compact <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> in Germany at Arvato Bertelsmann to ensure the audio quality of the album was preserved. The album is released as a double album, with the second disc being a bonus DVD with music videos of all ten tracks.|$|R
5000|$|A tortilla chip ( [...] , [...] ) is a snack food {{made from}} corn tortillas, which are {{cut into wedges}} and then fried—or baked (alternatively they may be <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> out of corn masa then fried or baked). Corn tortillas are made of corn, {{vegetable}} oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, tortilla chips were always {{considered to be a}} Mexican food, known as totopos and tostadas. Though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. Some manufacturers include many other ingredients including wheat, sugar, and monosodium glutamate.|$|R

40|$|Conventional electroactive stack {{components}} in thermal batteries are constructed from pressed-powder parts. These include the anode, separator, and cathode pellets (<b>discs).</b> <b>Pressing</b> parts {{that are less}} than 0. 010 inch thick is difficult. The use of plasma spray to deposit thin CoS{sub 2 } cathode films onto a stainless steel substrate was examined {{as an alternative to}} pressed-powder cathodes. The plasma-sprayed electrodes were tested in single cells under isothermal conditions and constant-current discharge over a temperature range of 400 C to 550 C using standard LiSi anodes and separators based on the LiCl-KCl eutectic. Similar tests were conducted with cells built with conventional pressed-powder cathodes, which were tested under the same conditions for comparative purposes. This paper presents the results of those tests...|$|R
50|$|MCA DiscoVision Inc. was a {{division}} of entertainment giant MCA, established in 1969 to develop and sell an optical videodisc system. MCA released <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> in Carson and Costa Mesa, California on the DiscoVision label from the format's Atlanta, Georgia launch in 1978 to 1982 {{and the release of}} the film, The Four Seasons. DiscoVision titles included films from Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Walt Disney Pictures. Agreements were made with Columbia Pictures and United Artists, though no discs were released on the DiscoVision label from either studio. Most of these companies later established their own labels for the format, the first being Paramount with a dozen movies released on the Paramount Home Video label in the summer of 1981.|$|R

5000|$|Ajax was a {{subsidiary}} of the Compo Company of Lachine, Quebec. Although a U.S. trademark on the name [...] "Ajax" [...] was filed in 1921, Ajax did not issue its first record until October 1923. The head of Ajax Records was H. S. Berliner, son of disc record pioneer Emile Berliner. Berliner's corporate headquarters were in Quebec City, Quebec, although U.S. issues listed the company as being based in Chicago, Illinois, where its U.S. office was located, but apparently no recording studio. Ajax is known to have used Compo's recording studios in Montreal and New York City. In addition to the sides which Ajax recorded themselves, the label also issued <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> from masters leased from New York Recording Laboratories and the Regal Record Company. The last Ajax released was in August 1925.|$|R

50|$|A {{manufacture}} {{on demand}} Blu-ray was released through Sony's Choice Collection on October 6, 2016. This release, {{along with other}} Choice Collection releases, was heavily criticized for being a BD-R disc, which means it is a burnt <b>disc</b> instead of <b>pressed,</b> these <b>discs</b> are essentially a bootleg and a BD-R is more susceptible to damage and has a much shorter lifespan of about 10 years opposed to a <b>pressed</b> <b>disc</b> lasting for 100 years if properly cared for.|$|R
40|$|Fe/KClO{sub 4 } {{pyrotechnic}} mixtures {{are used}} in thermal batteries to provide the heat necessary to bring the battery stack to operating temperatures of 550 to 600 C. This heat source is normally used as <b>discs</b> <b>pressed</b> from bulk powder. To evaluate the consequences associated with unexpected ignition of large amounts of heat powder, combustion of 84 % Fe/ 16 % KClO{sub 4 } heat powders was conducted for various scenarios under controlled conditions and the response documented. Increasing amounts of heat powder [...] up to 8 lbs [...] were ignited in both unconfined and confined (sealed) containers in a remote area. The containers were thermocoupled and the resulting burning filmed with a standard video camera, high-speed (1, 000 frames/s) film and video cameras, and an infrared video camera. A 20 - minute video of the burning under the various conditions is presented...|$|R
5|$|During 1978 and 1979, for {{the album}}'s tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album pressed on limited edition white vinyl in several countries.

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} records, {{the groove}} {{started at the}} inside of the recorded area near the label and proceeded outward toward the edge.

5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s Rubery Owen {{supplied}} many {{components and}} parts to the British motor industry {{but the most}} recognised is the Rostyle wheel (the word 'Rostyle' being a contraction of RO-Style). These were distinctive steel <b>disc</b> wheels <b>pressed</b> to a shape to give the effect of spokes. Rostyle wheels were common on British cars of the period both as manufacturer fitted options and aftermarket accessories.|$|R
