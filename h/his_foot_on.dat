5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the wolf's lower jaw and {{his hand on the}} wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E

Chavo managed to place <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> top of the bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on his stomach, Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E

By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> some balloon lines and falls to his death.

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase defended the World Tag Team Championship against Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The match began with Cryme Tyme in control, and Shad threw JTG {{over the top}} rope onto Rhodes and DiBiase. Rhodes and DiBiase, however, {{isolated}} JTG in their corner and performed a number of offensive maneuvers on him. Rhodes attempted a moonsault onto JTG, but missed, allowing JTG to tag in Shad {{at the same time}} Rhodes tagged in DiBiase. Shad performed a back body drop on DiBiase, but while the referee was distracted, Rhodes performed a DDT on Shad. DiBiase attempted to cover Shad, but was forced to break the cover as Shad placed <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the bottom rope. JTG attempted an inside cradle pin on Rhodes, but Shad accidentally pushed DiBiase on Rhodes, reversing the pinfall attempt so that Rhodes scored the pin over JTG, retaining his and DiBiase's title in the process.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr.

The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
5|$|On the May 7, 1995 (taped April 26, 1995) {{episode of}} WWF Action Zone, Holly pinned WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in a title match, but as Jarrett had <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the ropes, the {{decision}} was overturned and the title vacated. Later on in the show, Jarrett defeated Holly in a rematch for the vacant title after pinning Holly with a roll-up. Holly's title win is not recognized by WWE. Holly then competed in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Mantaur to qualify before losing to The Roadie in the quarterfinals.

5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E

Houston believed he had won, and Khruschev pinned him after performing a clothesline to win the match and the title. Houston had <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the ropes, but this was undetected by the referee.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} played on a cold icy field {{that would have a}} big impact on the game. The Browns took the opening kickoff and drove into Bills territory, but came up empty when Matt Bahr slipped while {{planting}} <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> a 45-yard field goal attempt. On Buffalo's second play after the missed kick, Kelly threw a short pass to Andre Reed. Defensive back Felix Wright slipped while going into coverage, leaving Reed wide open and he ended up taking the ball 72 yards to the end zone. But Cleveland struck back with a 45-yard field goal by Bahr and a 52-yard touchdown pass from Kosar to Slaughter in the second quarter. Kelly's 33-yard touchdown pass to James Lofton put the Bills back in the lead, 14–10, but the Browns retook the lead with Ron Middleton's 3-yard catch shortly {{before the end of the}} first half.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} an Intercontinental Championship match between Faarooq and the champion, The Rock. After Faarooq made his entrance, Howard Finkel {{announced}} The Rock's entrance; however, {{he did not}} come out and after a second announcement, Commissioner Slaughter came out and gave The Rock ten seconds to come out. If The Rock failed to come out, he would be stripped of the championship. After Slaughter counted to two, The Rock came out wearing a neck brace, from the earlier attack, and before {{he was able to}} get into the ring, Faarooq attacked The Rock in the aisle. After they entered the ring, the two wrestlers fought back and forth until Faarooq Spinebustered The Rock, and attempted to pin him, but The Rock broke the pin at a two count after he placed <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the bottom ring rope. As Faarooq argued with the referee, The Rock retaliated by rolling up Faarooq into a pinfall to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
25|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit {{on the right to}} better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the accelerator and the cars collided at 270km/h (170mph) and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.|$|E
