5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti {{have been shown to}} contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> history of use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America. Both contain mescaline.|$|E
5|$|Almonds (Prunus dulcis) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{important}} history of religious, {{social and cultural}} significance as a food.

5|$|As {{a highly}} {{radioactive}} element, americium {{and its compounds}} must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> penetration depth.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century.

5|$|Mazatec shamans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, {{using it to}} facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.

Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have {{expressed concern that the}} twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> snout {{that ends}} in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E

Middle school traditions include the alternating annual Greek and Shakespeare Fests, the sixth group World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores.

5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{discontinuation}} of serotonergic drugs, {{most cases}} of serotonin syndrome resolve within 24 hours, although {{in some cases}} delirium may persist {{for a number of}} days.

5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> birth interval.|$|E
