5|$|An {{equivalent}} active camouflage strategy, {{known to}} zoologists as counter-illumination, {{is used by}} many marine organisms, notably cephalopods such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi.

40|$|Four {{patients}} with five wounds {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with three occlusive dressings: DuoDERM, Restore and Comfeel Ulcus; the dressings were left intact for 24 - 48 h. When the dressings were removed, it was found that wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore and Comfeel contained coagulated sanguinous material. Two wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, <b>were</b> then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved. Although these preliminary data suggest that DuoDERM gel may have fibrinolytic properties, more extensive and controlled studies are needed to assess the characteristics of this dressing...|$|R

5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
