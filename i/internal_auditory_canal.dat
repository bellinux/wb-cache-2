25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to the cochlear nerve. In the IAC (<b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal)</b> decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the cochlear nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A 31 -year-old male patient {{presented}} with pro-gressive {{mixed hearing loss}} since birth. A stapedectomy was attempted and was unsuccessful because of perilymph gushing.

This unusual abnormality was found after the attempted stapedectomy and explains the clinical findings. The findings in male patients are fairly typical X-linked congenital deafness. In male patients, the combination of congenital mixed hearing loss and stapes gusher is a distinct defect suggesting an X-linked pattern of inheritance.

40|$|Pitfalls in the {{diagnosis}} of acoustic neuroma The patient with an acoustic neuroma may present to the otologist {{with a variety of}} clinical features. Classically these include a retrocochlear pattern of sensorineural hearing loss, reduced vestibular response on caloric testing and radiological asymmetry of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals</b> (IAC). The absence of any or all of these features, however, does not exclude the presence of tumour. Five cases are presented to illustrate the potential for diagnostic delay unless a routine battery of investigations is undertaken in patients with neuro-otological disorders. All patterns of subjective audiometry are encountered, auditory brain stem response testing may be unreliable where hearing loss is profound, vestibular testing is normal in half of small tumours and the intracanalicular tumour may be radiologically undetectable unless IAC meatography is employed...|$|R

Mechanisms related to the auditory involvement are discussed on the basis of audiological data. Gadolinium enhanced MRI is the most adequate technique for HP detection and for the differential diagnosis. A delay in the diagnosis of HP seems to be quite common and the consequences may be severe, especially in cases of optic nerve involvement. For these reasons, a cerebral MRI should probably be included in the assessment of PSNHL, especially when neurological signs coexist or are reported in the medical history...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPreparation of the {{temporal}} bone for light microscopy is an important step in histological studies of the inner ear. Due to the complexity of structures of the inner ear, it is difficult to measure or compare structures of interest without a commonly accepted standardized measure of temporal bone sections. Therefore, standardization of temporal bone sections is very important for histological assessment of sensory hair cells and peripheral ganglion neurons in the cochlear and vestibular systems. The standardized temporal bone sectioning is oriented to a plane parallel to the outer and <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals.</b> Sections are collected from the epitympanum to the hypotympanum to reveal layers in the order of the crista ampullaris of the superior and lateral semicircular canals, macula utriculi and macula sacculi, superior vestibular ganglion neurons, macula of saccule and inferior vestibular ganglion neurons, cochlear modiolus, endolymphatic duct and endolymphatic sac, and finally the crista ampullaris of the posterior semicircular canal.

40|$|The jugular foramen {{in normal}} volunteers was studied with 1. 5 T {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) systems in 3 -mm-thick head- and surface-coil images.

5000|$|An {{auditory}} brainstem response test (a.k.a. ABR) is a {{much more}} cost effective screening alternative to MRI for those at low risk of AN. This test provides information on the passage of an electrical impulse along the circuit from the inner ear to the brainstem pathways. An acoustic neuroma can interfere with the passage of this electrical impulse through the hearing nerve at the site of tumor growth in the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> even when hearing is still essentially normal. This implies the possible diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma when the test result is abnormal. An abnormal auditory brainstem response test should be followed by an MRI. The sensitivity of this test is proportional to the tumor size - the smaller the tumor, the more likely is a false negative result; small tumors within the auditory canal will often be missed. However, since these tumors would usually be watched rather than treated, the clinical significance of overlooking them may be negligible. [...] Advances in scanning and testing have made possible the identification of small acoustic neuromas (those still confined to the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal).</b> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using Gadolinium as an enhancing contrast material is the preferred diagnostic test for identifying acoustic neuromas. The image formed clearly defines an acoustic neuroma if it is present and this technique can identify tumors measuring down to 5 millimeters in diameter (the scan spacing).|$|E
50|$|The {{incision}} {{for this}} approach {{is located in a}} slightly different location. This approach creates an opening in the skull behind the mastoid part of the ear, near {{the back of the head}} on the side of the tumor. The surgeon exposes the tumor from its posterior (back) surface, thereby getting a very good view of the tumor in relation to the brainstem. When removing large tumors through this approach, the facial nerve can be exposed by early opening of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal.</b> Any size tumor can be removed with this approach. One of the main advantages of the retrosigmoid approach is the possibility of preserving hearing. For small tumors, a disadvantage lies in the risk of long-term postoperative headache.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The oculomotor cistern (OMC) {{is a small}} CSF-filled dural cuff that invaginates {{into the}} {{cavernous}} sinus, surrounding the third cranial nerve (CNIII). It is used by neuro-surgeons to mobilize CNIII during cavernous sinus surgery. In this article, we present the OMC imaging spectrum as delineated on 1. 5 T and 3 T MR images and demonstrate its involvement in cavernous sinus pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 78 high-resolution screening MR images of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals</b> (IAC) obtained for sensorineural hearing loss. Cistern length and diameter were measured. Fifty randomly selected whole-brain MR images were evaluated to determine how often the OMC can be visualized on routine scans.

The right cistern length averaged 4. 2 3. 2 mm; the opening diameter (the porus) averaged 2. 2 0. 8 mm. The maximal length observed was 13. 1 mm. The left cistern length averaged 3. 0 1. 7 mm; the porus diameter averaged 2. 1 1. 0 mm, with a maximal length of 5. 9 mm.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis]To {{describe}} {{the clinical presentation}} of peripheral facial palsy caused by neoplastic meningitis. [Study Design]Retrospective case series. [Methods]Retrospective review, including accompanying symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Results]Between January and December 2011, six patients were diagnosed with peripheral facial palsy caused by neoplastic meningitis. The patient age at presentation ranged from 56 to 77 years. The tumor origins were as follows: malignant lymphoma (n[*]=[*] 3), lung cancer (n[*]=[*] 2), and kidney cancer (n[*]=[*] 1). In three patients, sudden sensorineural hearing loss accompanied the facial palsy. Three patients were judged to be tumor-free {{at the onset of}} the facial palsy. In two patients, the malignancy was not diagnosed at the onset of facial palsy and hearing loss. Only one patient was diagnosed as having a tumor {{at the onset of the}} facial palsy. On the MRI, a mass lesion was detected in the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals</b> (IAC) of four patients; one had a solitary IAC tumor. In this patient, the diagnosis required a histopathological study using a translabyrinthine approach. In the other two patients, the facial nerve was enhanced with gadolinium, but it was difficult to differentiate the observed condition from Bell's palsy. In these patients, repeated cytological studies led to the correct diagnoses.
