50|$|Inflammation, such as {{that caused}} by sepsis, causes endothelial dysfunction, fluid leakage from the {{capillaries}} and impaired drainage of fluid from the lungs.

40|$|Effects of airway closure on {{pulmonary}} <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> {{were examined}} in 22 healthy subjects. Airway closure was assessed by a single-breath N 2 technique, <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> by A-aD 02, venous admixture, and cardiac output (dye-dilution). Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured by a helium technique. A posture change from seated to supine produced changes of lung volumes allowing functional effects of airway closure to be isolated. Closing volume (lung volume where airway closure starts to occur) was unchanged with posture while FRC fell in the supine position. When airway closure occured below FRC in both postures, <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> was improved in the supine posture.

50|$|Subsequent {{specific}} allergen exposure {{leads to}} cross-bridging of IgE molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and {{release of a}} vast array of mediators. These mediators include histamine; leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4; and a host of cytokines. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and mucous gland secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the smooth muscles, edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause the airway hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> and hypoxemia.|$|E
50|$|A high V/Q ratio {{decreases}} PACO2 {{and increases}} PAO2. Because {{of the increased}} dead space ventilation, the PaO2 is reduced and thus also the peripheral oxygen saturation is lower than normal, leading to tachypnea and dyspnea. This finding is typically associated with pulmonary embolism (where blood circulation is impaired by an embolus). Ventilation is wasted, as it fails to oxygenate any blood. A high V/Q can also be observed in emphysema as a maladaptive ventilatory overwork of the undamaged lung parenchyma. Because {{of the loss of}} alveolar surface area, there is proportionally more ventilation per available perfusion area. As a contrast, this loss of surface area leads to decreased arterial pO2 due to <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> (see Fick's laws of diffusion).|$|E
5000|$|Pulmonary edema is fluid {{accumulation}} in {{the tissue}} and air {{spaces of the}} lungs. It leads to <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung parenchyma or vasculature of the lung (noncardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially acute, can lead to fatal respiratory distress or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term is from the Greek [...] (oídēma, [...] "swelling"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, [...] "I swell").|$|E
25|$|Afferent {{signals are}} sensory {{neuronal}} signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise {{from a large}} number of sources including the carotid bodies, medulla, lungs, and chest wall. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O2, CO2 and H+. In the lungs, juxtacapillary (J) receptors are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema, while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. Muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leading to hypercapnia, left heart failure leading to interstitial edema (<b>impairing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange),</b> asthma causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.|$|R

40|$|Aims. {{the aims}} {{of this study were}} to {{validate}} the signs and symptoms of the respiratory nursing diagnoses <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> ineffective airway clearance and ineffective breathing pattern in patients under mechanical ventilation; to verify whether intubation time and ventilatory modalities were related factors for respiratory nursing diagnoses; to verify the occurrence of shared signs and symptoms in the diagnoses and compare them with North American Nursing Diagnosis Association's proposition and to ascertain whether respiratory nursing diagnoses occur in isolated or associated patterns. Background. the need for mechanical ventilation is common in several patients admitted to intensive care units. Therefore, critical care nurses should identify the respiratory nursing diagnoses of high incidence. Design and methods. Descriptive observational study, with 177 evaluations of surgical and medical critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. the study adopted Fehring's Modified Clinical Diagnostic Validity Model, with a suggested alteration. Results. the critical signs and symptoms were the same as proposed by North American Nursing Diagnosis Association, when the diagnoses were separately identified, although no particular sign and symptom was found for ineffective breathing pattern. <b>Impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> and ineffective airway clearance were identified as having 88 (49 - 7 %) evaluations sharing the critical signs and symptoms. Intubation time and ventilation modality were related factors for the development of ineffective airway clearance and ineffective breathing pattern. Conclusion. the critical signs and symptoms of <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> were abnormal blood gases and hypoxemia. for ineffective airway clearance, they were rhonchi and decreased breath sounds. No highlights were found for ineffective breathing pattern signs and symptoms. Validation by experts has confirmed these findings. the interface between ineffective airway clearance and <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange</b> was confirmed by the presence of the shared critical signs and symptoms. Relevance to clinical practice. Studies like this are relevant to clinical practice because they evaluate the adequacy of Taxonomy 11 for patients under mechanical ventilation in clinical practice, thus allowing for the intensive care nurses to go from one mechanical-and routine practice to a critical, reflexive practice, committed to professional progress.

Dyspnoea {{is one of the most}} common and disabling symptoms in patients with ILD, significantly impacting quality of life. The mechanisms causing dyspnoea are complex and not yet fully understood.

The respiratory derangement observed in ILD patients at rest is even more evident during exercise. Pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for exertional dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance include altered respiratory mechanics, <b>impaired</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exchange,</b> cardiovascular abnormalities and peripheral muscle dysfunction. This review describes the respiratory physiology of ILD, both at rest and during exercise, and aims to provide comprehensive and updated evidence on the clinical utility of the cardiopulmonary exercise test in the assessment and management of these pathological entities.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} are largely determined by {{which side of the}} heart fails.

In systolic dysfunction, the ejection fraction is decreased, leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle. In diastolic dysfunction, the end-diastolic ventricular pressure will be high. This increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins. Increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema.
