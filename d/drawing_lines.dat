5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by <b>drawing</b> <b>lines.</b> Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by <b>drawing</b> <b>lines</b> between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E

25|$|As late as 1863, horse <b>drawn</b> <b>lines</b> {{were still}} {{considered}} a viable form of transportation. The Oakwood and Geddes lines were built that year. Later, steam locomotives replaced the horse <b>drawn</b> <b>lines.</b> The list of railroads is in chronological order.|$|R

50|$|Similar to {{drawing a}} picture, users {{can use a}} Circuit Scribe pen to <b>draw</b> <b>lines</b> on a simple piece of paper. They can then attach special {{electrical}} components on the <b>drawn</b> <b>lines</b> which allows the electrical currents to run through the components. This replaces the use of breadboards and wires.|$|R
25|$|The Graphics Device Interface is {{responsible}} for tasks such as <b>drawing</b> <b>lines</b> and curves, rendering fonts and handling palettes. The Windows NT 3.x series of releases had placed the GDI component in the user-mode Client/Server Runtime Subsystem, but this was moved into kernel mode with Windows NT 4.0 to improve graphics performance.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the other point). If we draw both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. <b>Drawing</b> <b>lines</b> between the two original points and one of these new points completes {{the construction of an}} equilateral triangle.|$|E
25|$|The Council {{created a}} districting {{committee}} to propose several different possible district maps and hold public hearings before presenting one {{plan to the}} Council to approve. State law required the City Council to make a final decision on the districts within 90 days of being notified that the referendum had officially passed, meaning that the Council voting on the districts would be the 1982 Council, not the 1981 Council creating them. Then-president Patrick McDonough, who opposed district representation, appointed Rosemary Sansone, a major advocate of district representation, {{as chair of the}} districting committee, but chose Frederick C. Langone, Dapper O'Neil, and John W. Sears as the other three members, all of whom opposed district representation. Both Langone and O'Neil would be returning to the Council in 1982, but Sansone did not run for re-election in 1981 and {{would not be able to}} vote on the district boundaries if the committee did not work quickly to present a plan to the Council before the end of the year. Public hearings over possible district boundaries were full of heated debate between advocates of <b>drawing</b> <b>lines</b> to protect neighborhood unity and advocates of <b>drawing</b> <b>lines</b> to create two predominantly minority districts and give minorities a voice in local government. Contention centered around Dorchester and the South End. Dorchester, Boston's largest neighborhood, needed to be split into at least two districts. A simple split in half would create either a north and a south district or an east and a west district. An east district would be largely White (75% or greater) and a west district would be largely African-American. North and south districts would have less extreme majorities. Many residents were opposed to both divisions, stating that they would increase racial segregation in Dorchester and continue the political powerlessness of minorities. A more complicated split taking into account areas with large minority populations would create one predominantly minority district and one predominantly white district but treat Dorchester as several smaller neighborhoods to be divvied up among surrounding neighborhoods rather than as one community. In various proposals, the South End, due to its location, was grouped with either South Boston or Back Bay/Beacon Hill by advocates of neighborhood unity, or Roxbury by advocates of minority-dominated districts.|$|E

Subsequently, she is portrayed drawing stars and walking through the world she has created. The next scene sees the singer playing the piano in a room with a small window, which Lee then touches to break and to illuminate the screen with white light. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, at the end, [...] "she eventually realizes that, in spite of her attempts, she is just as trapped as she was before [...] At [...] clip's end, the viewer is left to wonder whether she has the power to escape [...] which, in a way, only further connects the video to the song itself." ...|$|E
