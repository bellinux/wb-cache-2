As he recalled: After having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with A. van Wijngaarden, who was then my boss at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities {{harder and harder to}} combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A programmer? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was programming? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings <b>I</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> van Wijngaarden's office door, asking him whether I could [...] "speak to him for a moment"; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person.

This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could. Edsger Dijkstra ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15, his {{grandparents}} built in his room next to his bed and among his personal belongings a small recording studio, where he began recording Christian and even some political jingles. His work was going full steam ahead, and again {{his grandparents}} trusting their grandson's talent was gaining seriousness they decide {{to give him the}} second story of their house. It is here where Eliel prepared a more elaborate recording studio where he began experimenting with reggaeton. At 16, known as DJ Menor, he began his work with the most successful rappers at the time: Baby Rasta & Gringo, Bebe, Hornyman y Pantyman, Charlie y Felito, among others. Later on he is offered a professional contract and moves to Santurce, Puerto Rico, close by to all the record companies. It was in the Santurce area where he met the then rookie artist, Don Omar, his now colleague and best friend. Immediately he signs a contract with the record company VI Music to record the voices of all of their artists. His made his first musical track for Daddy Yankee y Nicky Jam for the album Las Gargolas. Upon listening to it the singers did not believe it had been made by Eliel and thought it was a track taken out of a movie soundtrack. It is this special musical touch in his tracks in which he includes different rhythms and musical instruments that make his tracks something hard to believe. He has created more musical tracks that are the representation of the reggaeton scene in Puerto Rico; these are [...] "Donde estan las Gatas" [...] in the voice of Daddy Yankee, [...] "Salen Inquietas" [...] by Magnate y Valentino, and [...] "Dile" [...] and [...] "Vuelve" [...] in the voice of Don Omar. In 2002 he worked on the albums La Reconquista of the former duo Hector y Tito, a compilation of various artists Mas Flow 1, and on [...] "Don Omar: The Last Don (album)." [...] With his success in the reggaeton world, his colleagues tried to give him an artistic name, but the name Eliel was already established. It is because of his shy nature that he becomes known as [...] "the one that speaks with his hands" [...] and has been consecrated as the genius behind the music that is taking over. Eliel has produced hit songs and converted them into hits.for reggaeton stars such as Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Hector [...] "El Father", Magnate y Valentino, amongst others. Eliel recently worked with Don Omar's new recording production, King of Kings, and in the production Reggaeton Confessions, where exponents of different musical genres are uniting with reggaeton.
