This is a brief account of Tipperary and some of the cowboys who tested their skill against his. Tipperary was born in 1905, on a Montana ranch near Camp Crook, South Dakota. 1 Tipperary was a dark bay gelding without any white on him. He was branded with FR. 2 He stood 15 hands and 3 inches tall and weighed slightly over 1, 000 pounds. 3 At the age of four, Tipperary was corralled with the intention of being broken to ride. Tipperary’s halter was tied to a log. During the night a thunderstorm came up, and Tipperary busted loose and was gone by morning. 4 Six years later, in April of 1915, Tipperary was taken to Camp Crook. E...|$|E

40|$|Audiophiles are exited. A {{special event}} has {{occurred}} {{that promises to}} undermine their very foundation and transcend "the event sociological": a minority group now cite conductor and interconnect performance as a limiting factor within an audio system.

Believing in Ohm's law, they feel strong in their brotherhood. But the revolution moves forward [...] . This article examines propagation in cables from the fundamental principles of modern electromagnetic theory. The aim is to attempt to identify mechanisms that form a rational basis for a more objective understanding of claimed sonic anomalies in interconnects. Especially as <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>hearing</b> persistent rumours about the virtues of single-strand, thin wires (John, is it OK to mention thin, single strand in HFN/RR yet? [...] .) Inevitably, the path towards an objective understanding depends upon both the correctness and completeness of the model selected. We shall establish, therefore, a theoretic stance initially and commence with the work of Maxwell (even though he could not avail himself of a distortion factor meter.) The equations of Maxwell concisely describe the foundation and principles of electromagnetism; they are central to a proper modelling of all electromagnetic systems.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the reception {{and use of}} the Epistle to the Romans in fourth and fifth century Antiochene tradition, focusing on the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, John Chrysostom, and Theodoret of Cyrus. Particular attention is paid to the twin loci of Greek patristic ambivalence with the concept of predestination (especially as that finds expression in the Augustinian traditions), namely, “this body of sin ” in 6 : 6 - 8 and the concept of προαίρεσις, the free choice between good and evil as an innate property of human nature. “As <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>hearing</b> the Epistles of the blessed Paul read, and that twice every week, and often three or four times … gladly do I enjoy the spiritual trumpet, and get roused and warmed with desire at recognizing the voice so dear to me (τὴν ἐμοὶ φίλην ἐπιγινώσκων φωνήν), and seem to fancy him all but present to my sight, and behold him conversing with me. ” 1 This is how John Chrysostom opens the ὑπόθεσις of his homilies on the Epistle to the Romans. He was not alone; all the Antiochenes of the fourth and fifth century, including his dear friend Theodore of Mopsuestia and their student and theological heir, Theodoret of Cyrus, loved the apostle Paul deeply and spent much of their respective careers commenting, preaching, and teaching from the Pauline corpus. It was a love they seem to have inherited from their teacher, Diodore of Tarsus (d. 393) who first established the hermeneutical principles of the so-called (inaccurately) “school ” of Antiochene interpretation {{in the middle of the}} fourth century in 1 John Chrysostom, “The Argument, ” in Homilies on the Epistles of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, A Selec...|$|E
