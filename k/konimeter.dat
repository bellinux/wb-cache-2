40|$|The {{application}} of different mechanical extraction ventilation systems in reducing and controlling dust concentrations in weaned and finishing pig houses was analyzed and {{discussed in this}} work. Dust concentrations and airflow velocities have been measured at 20 measuring points, smoothly positioned over the house cross section, in the net consisting of 4 horizontal and 5 vertical rows. The lowest horizontal row was positioned at the pigs breathing zone (40 cm above the floor), and the highest (fourth) horizontal row was positioned at the workers breathing zone (160 cm). Control values were measured in houses with closed doors and windows and all the fans switched off. These values were compared with three experimental sets of values achieved with: floor, roof and both ventilation systems. Dust concentrations were measured by <b>konimeter</b> (<b>Konimeter</b> 10, Karl Zeiss Jena), airflow velocity in ventilation ducts with a turbine anemometer and the airflow velocity at measuring points with hot wire anemometer. In the finishing house significant decrement of inhalable (F = 44. 35, P << 0. 01) and respirable (F = 43. 82, P << 0. 01) dust concentration was achieved in the third experimental treatment. In the weaned piglets house, significant decrement of inhalable (F = 49. 43, P << 0. 01) and respirable (F = 42. 69, P << 0. 01) dust concentration was achieved with floor ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Simultaneous {{airborne}} dust samples were taken with five types of instrument, namely, <b>konimeter,</b> thermal precipitator, membrane filter, tyndallometer and VC 25 gravimetric sampler, {{on the surface}} and underground at two types of asbestos mine, producing amosite and Cape crocidolite respectively. The results were analysed and compared in terms of five different concentration parameters, namely, particles plus short fibres (p + sf), long fibres (If), particles plus short fibres plus long fibres (p + sf+ 10, the volume (tyndallometer readings) and the mass of dust (VC 25). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was used to test for normality and the Bartlett statistic for equality of variance of the transformed concentration data recorded by each type of instrument. Fourteen linear relationships were investigated. In those cases where replicates were given these were used to obtain estimates of the error variances for the predictor and the response variables. With these estimates an additional regression equation to the least squares equation was determined. This new equation is recommended in preference to the corresponding least squares equation, as it is based on information which is discarded when only the position means are used. All but one of the fourteen relationships reached statistical significance. The <b>konimeter</b> and the thermal precipitator can be linked with the membrane filter, the tyndallometer can reveal short time variations in the fibre level and the VC 25 can disclose the asbestos content of the fine dust...|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{investigation was}} carried out to determine the relationship between silicosis in hardrock miners in Ontario and cumulative exposure to silica (free crystalline silica-α quartz) dust. This second report describes a side-by-side air-sampling program used to derive a konimeter/gravimetric silica conversion curve. A total of 2, 360 filter samples and 90, 000 <b>konimeter</b> samples were taken over 2 years in two mines representing the ore types gold and uranium, both in existing conditions {{as well as in}} an experimental stope in which dry drilling was used to simulate the high dust conditions of the past. The method of calculating cumulative respirable silica exposure indices for each miner is reported...|$|E
