25|$|After 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{out of the}} track. Dot-balls flourished, but the {{partnership}} kept in there, and a second six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation when he brought Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep it tight, but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top {{speed of the vehicle}} and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics is that it may cause the vehicle to <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> lift. Lift is an aerodynamic force that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|E

Simon {{commented that}} he [...] "wasn't enjoying it anymore," [...] wished to pursue other projects, and [...] "that any show I've ever worked on, it turns {{me into a}} monster. I go crazy. I hate myself." [...] Before leaving, he {{negotiated}} a deal that saw him receive {{a share of the}} show's profits every year, particularly from home media, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993. The deal means he made over $10 million a year from The Simpsons; he later told Stanford Magazine that [...] "tens of millions" [...] was a closer figure. Simon commented: [...] "When I was there I thought I was underpaid. I thought I wasn't getting enough credit for it. Now, I think it's completely the opposite.

500|$|Many critics {{believed}} {{that the number of}} releases of Guitar Hero games was [...] "milking" [...] the brand name and oversaturating the market. PaRappa the Rapper creator Masaya Matsuura stated that the video game market was growing stale and needed to move beyond games that simply challenge the player to mimic the playing of licensed music. Ryan Geddes of IGN stated that he [...] "hit the wall with play-along music games", and challenged the game makers to explore other ways to combine music and video games. Analysts stated that such games must continue to innovate instead of just providing more songs in order to prevent [...] "genre fatigue". Jesse Divnich of Electronic Entertainment and Design Research commented that, much like Dance Dance Revolution, Guitar Hero and other music games explosively grew initially due to significant new features from other games but have become stagnant due to focusing on content over features, and suggested that for the genre to continue to grow, they must look to incremental changes as done with the first-person shooter genre. Former CEO for RedOctane, Kelly Sumner, {{believed that}} Activision [...] "abused" [...] the series, as [...] "they tried to <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> out of the franchise too quickly".|$|E

According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word.

As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
