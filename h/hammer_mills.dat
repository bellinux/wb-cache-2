The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus more reliable which results in much more energy efficiency. The screenless hammer mill was invented in 1995 by MIT professor and engineer Amy B. Smith.|$|E

2500|$|The tilt hammer or tail helve hammer has a pivot at {{the centre}} of the helve on which it is mounted, and is lifted by pushing the {{opposite}} end to the head downwards. In practice, the head on such hammers seems to have been limited to one hundredweight (about 50kg), but a very rapid stroke rate was possible. This made it suitable for drawing iron down to small sizes suitable for the cutlery trades. [...] There were therefore many such forges known as 'tilts' around Sheffield. They were also used in brass battery works for making brass (or copper) pots and pans. In battery works (at least) it was possible for one power source to operate several hammers. In Germany, tilt hammers of up to 300kg were used in <b>hammer</b> <b>mills</b> to forge iron. Surviving, working hammers, powered by water wheels, may be seen, for example, at the Frohnauer Hammer in the Ore Mountains.|$|E

2500|$|In the Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of the population worked in agriculture and animal husbandry. [...] The shoreline and hill dwellers operated some fishing boats and some commerce and trade. [...] Already in the 13th Century there were mills, <b>hammer</b> <b>mills</b> and sawmills, as well as later lime kilns in the village. [...] Starting in the 15th Century much of the population emigrated to Milan and Tuscany. [...] The later immigrants from Brissago were traditionally cooks and hoteliers. [...] In the 18th Century some families moved to Locarno and Ascona, where they gained a certain reputation. The opening of a spinning mill in 1854, which became two years later a tobacco factory, gradually changed, the socio-economic structure of the municipality. [...] In 1888 a new factory was built, and in the first decades of the 20th Century industrial activity reached its peak, with more than 600 people, mostly women, employed in tobacco processing. [...] During this time, the municipality also began to develop into a resort town with many second homes and hotels. [...] This change accelerated in 1907 with the construction of the Grande Albergo hotel, which was demolished in 1993. [...] After 1970, the services sector was the most important part of the local economy. [...] The growth in the 1960s and 1970s led the town to grow up the hillsides and become a contiguous residential area.|$|E

The model parameters were calibrated using a pilot-scale swing <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> at various operating conditions. The effects of the underscreen configurations and the feed sizes on <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> operations were demonstrated through the fitted model parameters. Relationships between the model parameters and the machine configurations were established. The model was validated using the independent experimental data of single lithotype coal tests with the same BJD pilot-scale <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> and full operation audit data of an industrial <b>hammer</b> <b>mill.</b> The outcome of the energy-based swing <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> model is the capability to simulate the impact of changing blends of coal or mill configurations and operating conditions on product size distribution.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study effects of grinding and pelleting on feed structure using either wheat or maize as a base ingredients. In experiment 1, four diets were formulated to contain either completely ground base ingredients using 3 mm and 6 mm screen size in <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> or base ingredients were added as whole grain in ration of 30 % whole grain 70 % ground material. In addition base ingredients were mixed with mineral and vitamin premix to make complete diets. Smaller particles improved pellet durability but replacement of ground ingredients with whole ingredinets increased hardness. Coarse structure of the diets reduced energy consumption when compared with fine structured diets. In experiment 2, pure wheat and barley were used as ingredients and were ground using either <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> fitted with 3 mm sieve or roller mill using 1. 5 mm gap between rolls. In addition, {{a combination of the}} <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> fitted with 3 mm screen and roller mill with the 1. 5 mm gap between rolls as a singular method was tested. Higher pellet durability and lower energy consumption was observed for wheat diets when compared to maize diets. Combination of the <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> + roller mill showed higher pellet durability for both cereal sources when compared with either <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> or roller mill alone. Larger proportion of the particles smaller than 1. 0 mm were found when diets were ground on a <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> fitted with 3 mm screen in comparison to <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> fitted with 6 mm screen (experiment 1) or roller mill with 1. 5 mm roller gap (experiment 2).

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there is an}} {{emerging}} trend of coarse grinding of cereals in production of poultry feed due to positive influence of coarse particles on poultry digestive system. Influence of grinding method (<b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> vs. roller mill) and grinding intensity of corn (coarseness of grinding) on mill specific energy consumption and pellet quality was investigated. By decreasing grinding intensity of corn (coarser grinding), specific energy consumption of both <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> and roller mill was significantly decreased (p < 0. 05). When comparing similar grinding intensities on <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> and roller mill (similar geometric mean diameter or similar particle size distribution), specific energy consumption was higher for the <b>hammer</b> <b>mill.</b> Pellet quality decreased with coarser grinding on <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> but, however, this effect was not observed for the roller mill. Generally, pellet quality was better when roller mill was used. It can be concluded that significant energy savings could be achieved by coarser grinding of corn before pelleting and by using roller <b>mill</b> instead of <b>hammer</b> <b>mill.</b> From the aspect of pellet quality, if coarser grinding is applied {{it is better to}} use roller mill, concerning that more uniform particle size distribution of corn ground on roller mill probably results in more uniform particle size distribution in pellets and this provides better pellet quality.
