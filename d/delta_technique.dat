Often uncertainties significantly degrade performance of load forecasting models. Besides, {{there is no}} index available indicating reliability of predicted values.

The <b>delta</b> <b>technique</b> is applied for constructing prediction intervals for outcomes of neural network models. Some statistical measures are developed for quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of prediction intervals. According to these measures, a new cost function is designed for shortening length of prediction intervals without compromising their coverage probability. Simulated annealing is used for minimization of this cost function and adjustment of neural network parameters. Demonstrated results clearly show that the proposed methods for constructing prediction interval outperforms the traditional <b>delta</b> <b>technique.</b> Besides, it yields prediction intervals that are practically more reliable and useful than exact point predictions. <br /...|$|E

We propose a new storage technique called differential erasure coding (DEC) where the differences (deltas) between subsequent versions are stored rather than the whole objects, akin to a typical <b>delta</b> encoding <b>technique.</b> However, unlike <b>delta</b> encoding <b>techniques,</b> DEC opportunistically exploits the sparsity (i. e., when the differences between two successive versions have few non-zero entries) in the updates to store the deltas using compressed sensing techniques applied with erasure coding. We first show that DEC provides significant savings in the storage size for versioned data whenever the update patterns are characterized by in-place alterations. Subsequently, we propose a practical DEC framework so as to reap storage size benefits against not just in-place alterations but also real-world update patterns such as insertions and deletions that alter the overall data sizes.

A {{meaningful}} {{feature of}} the helicopter industry {{compared to the other}} aeronautical industries is the production of transmissions: the essential components for driving the power from the engines to the rotor blades. Transmissions are composed of gears most of which are vital for flight safe; hence gears are requested to be designed and manufactured with a very high quality standard. One of the widely diffused processes to manufacture helicopter gears is electron beam welding (EBW), whose nondestructive testing must assure high sensitivity and defect detection capability, independently by the defect position or orientation in the joint. It was just to answer to this requirement that a special application of the ultrasonic scattering (“delta ” technique) has been introduced, starting from the early seventies, in the automatic scanning inspection of welded joints.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} travel times is desirable but frequently prone to error. This is mainly attributable {{to both the}} underlying traffic processes and the data {{that are used to}} infer travel time. A more meaningful and pragmatic approach is to view travel time prediction as a probabilistic inference and to construct prediction intervals (PIs), which cover the range of probable travel times travelers may encounter. This paper introduces the delta and Bayesian techniques for the construction of PIs. Quantitative measures are developed and applied for a comprehensive assessment of the constructed PIs. These measures simultaneously address two important aspects of PIs: 1) coverage probability and 2) length. The Bayesian and delta methods are used to construct PIs for the neural network (NN) point forecasts of bus and freeway travel time data sets. The obtained results indicate that the <b>delta</b> <b>technique</b> outperforms the Bayesian technique in terms of narrowness of PIs with satisfactory coverage probability. In contrast, PIs constructed using the Bayesian technique are more robust against the NN structure and exhibit excellent coverage probability...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a potential architecture design for future wireless base station. Issues associated with components of the architecture are investigated. The all-digital transmitter architecture uses a combination of envelope elimination and restoration (EER) and pulse width modulation (PWM)/pulse position modulation (PPM) modulation. The performance of this architecture is predicted from the measured output power and efficiency curves of a GaN amplifier. 57 % efficiency is obtained for an OFDM signal limited to 8 dB peak to average power ratio.

Many new topologies have been presented trying to obtain a cost-effective solution to reduce the input current harmonic content {{and to make it}} sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage of AC-DC converters.
