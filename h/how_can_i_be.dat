2500|$|Mahathir {{continued}} to attract controversy in retirement for remarks on international affairs. He is a strident critic of Israel, {{to the point}} where in 2012 he stated: [...] "I am glad to be labeled antisemitic [...] <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> otherwise, when the Jews who so often talk of the horrors they suffered during the Holocaust show the same Nazi cruelty and hard-heartedness towards not just their enemies but even towards their allies should any try to stop the senseless killing of their Palestinian enemies." [...] Mahathir established the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission to investigate the activities of the United States, Israel and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He has also suggested that the September 11 attacks of 2001 might have been staged by the United States government.|$|E

I have ordered Jia Chong to lead 10,000 infantry and cavalry into the Xie Valley and station at Yuecheng. I will lead 100,000 troops to garrison at Chang'an. We will be meeting each other soon." [...] After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, [...] "When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, he knew I was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours. If we fail, we can retreat back to Shu Han and do as Liu Bei did before us.

2500|$|In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' {{do is not}} a {{limit on}} its actual agency, but an {{epistemological}} boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, [...] "I am a liar", then {{how can it be}} true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. [...] Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, [...] "God can" [...] before it. Lewis additionally said that, [...] "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." [...] This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.|$|E
