5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral traits with early primates.

5|$|This genus has one species, {{influenza}} A virus. Wild aquatic {{birds are}} the natural hosts {{for a large}} variety of influenza A.

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{their corresponding}} phenotypes when paired {{with any other}} allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the brain, and cells at the caudal end <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure.

Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E
5|$|Maupertuis' {{ideas were}} in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray.

The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design.|$|E

Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in lamin genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies.
