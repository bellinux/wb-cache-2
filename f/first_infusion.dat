500|$|The {{earliest}} {{breeding of}} the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done {{in large part by}} English churches and monasteries, to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England. These medieval horses gained the nickname of [...] "Chapman Horses" [...] because of their use by travelling merchants known as [...] "chapmen". What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares. The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe, bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England. The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain. The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses, and the <b>first</b> <b>infusion</b> of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses. The Spanish horses also {{made their way to the}} outlying estates of English nobility, and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell's men after the English Civil War. Once in the hands of Cromwell's men, many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses, adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines. In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves.|$|E

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{that target}} T cells have shown some benefit in rheumatoid arthritis although responses {{have not been}} long lasting.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityMonoclonal {{antibodies}} have {{an increased}} risk of infusion reaction. Factors in the etiology of infusion reactions include percentage of mouse protein; immune response and cytokine release.

Predictive factors of infusion reactions include prior <b>first</b> <b>infusions,</b> increased amounts of lymphocytes, geographical region and rapid infusions. Management of reactions includes consideration of a test dose, premedication, supportive care and treatment alternatives of fully humanized monoclonal antibodies. Additional management options include desensitization protocols, as well as standing orders and crash cart availability. To improve patient safety, an emphasis is needed on staff education {{and the development of a}} process to evaluate and identify patients at risk. Standardized clinical pathways, policies and procedures need to be well rehearsed by staff to reduce negative consequences of infusion reactions. More research is needed on the identification of risk factors, as well as a clearer understanding of the mechanism of a monoclonal antibody infusion reaction. Monetary implications and hospitalizations are important to further determine the direct cost of infusion reactions of monoclonal antibodies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} how propranolol modifies the circulatory effects of epinephrine infused to produce plasma concentrations achieved during dental local anesthesia and to evaluate the effects of propranolol on the plasma clearance of epinephrine. The study was performed on six healthy male volunteers ranging in age from 25 to 34 yr.

Plasma epinephrine clearance decreased to 54. 7 +/- 9. 3 % of the control value after propranolol was given. Epinephrine showed initially a predominantly beta-adrenergic action, but this action was inhibited by propranolol.

We report the first experience using MSCs to treat refractory aGVHD in 33 pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT from Turkey. Totally, 68 doses of bone marrow derived MSCs were infused. The median dose of MSC was 1. 18 × 106 cells per kg body weight. Overall, complete response (CR) was documented in 18 patients, partial response (PR) was documented in 7 patients, and no response (NR) was documented in 8 patients. The 2 -year estimated probability of overall survival (OS) for patients achieving CR and PR/NR was 63. 8 % and 29. 4 %, respectively p= 0. 0002. While the cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) at day 100 after <b>first</b> MSC <b>infusion</b> was 46. 6 % in PR/NR patients, there was no any TRM at day 100 after <b>first</b> MSC <b>infusion</b> in CR patients p= 0. 001.

30|$|Theories {{regarding}} {{the mechanism of}} bisphosphonate-induced uveitis include immunologic or toxic reactions caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines [31, 48].

It should be noted, however, that inflammatory reactions, including anterior uveitis, can occur following administration of non-nitrogen, halogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as clodronate [50].

40|$|AIM: To assess {{safety of}} rapid {{infusion}} by measuring infusion-related {{side effects and}} toxicities. METHODS: Participants received the <b>first</b> rituximab <b>infusion</b> according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. If well-tolerated, they then received the second and subsequent infusions {{at a rate of}} 20 % of the dose over the first 30 min and the remaining 80 % over the next hour. Premedication was administered for all the infusions. RESULTS: A total of 243 infusions in 65 consecutive participants were evaluated. Six experienced a grade 1 reaction and one a grade 3 transfusion-related adverse event. Three of these participants were withdrawn from the rapid infusion study. The other four participants (grade 1 only participants) were re-challenged. The same premedication was used as in the <b>first</b> rapid <b>infusion.</b> On experiencing a grade 1 reaction, promethazine 12. 5 mg i. v. was administered and infusion recommenced at 50 % of the previous rate upon the resolution of symptoms. Three patients developed a grade 1 adverse event and one patient experienced no adverse reaction. The three patients who did not tolerate the second rapid infusion were withdrawn from this study. CONCLUSION: A rituximab infusion over 90 -min was safe and feasible for participants who seek treatment at ambulatory cancer centre. The new regimen has been adopted as a standard practice with better resource utilization.
