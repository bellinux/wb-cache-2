50|$|Lasius neglectus is a polygynous, {{sometimes}} invasive, ant of {{the genus}} Lasius. The ant was identified in 1990 after establishing a colony in Budapest, Hungary. Superficially, they are similar in appearance to the common black <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius niger, but have significantly different behavioural patterns, particularly in the social structure within colonies.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger), {{also known}} as the common black ant, is a {{formicine}} ant, the type species of the subgenus Lasius, found all over Europe and in some parts of North America, South America and Asia. The European species was split into two species; L. niger is found in open areas, while L. platythorax is found in forest habitats. It is monogynous, meaning colonies have a single queen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>Ant</b> - He {{spends his}} time {{taking care of}} his plants and flowers. He cultivates {{vegetables}} for the Glo Friend community, and has a vast knowledge about them.

50|$|Black <b>garden</b> <b>ants</b> often {{explore their}} {{surroundings}} quite extensively during early summer months {{in an effort}} to increase the food supply to their queen and her young, and also as a way of testing new ground in preparation for the nests' summer flight.

On a test plot of field beans (Vicia faba), plants without black bean aphids yielded an average of 56 seeds per plant, those with aphids and no ants yielded 17 seeds, and those with both ants and aphids averaged eight seeds per plant.|$|R
5000|$|Lasius is a genus of {{formicine}} ants. [...] The type {{species for}} this genus {{is the black}} <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius niger. Other major members, which live in drier heathland, are the cornfield ant, L. neoniger, and L. alienus. Other species include the temporary social parasites of the L. mixtus group and the hyper-social parasite Lasius fuliginosus. Lasius flavus is also a commonly seen species, building grassy hillocks in undisturbed pasture. In the Alps, these mounds - always aligned east to catch the first rays of the rising sun - have been traditionally used by goatherds as natural compasses.|$|E
40|$|The {{myrmecophilous}} isopod Platyarthrus hofffmannseggii Brandt, 1833 and the myrmecophilous springtail Cyphoderus albinus Nicolet, 1842 {{are commonly}} found in nests {{of a wide range}} of ant species in Belgium. Here we report the first record of both myrmecophiles in nests of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus in the Citadelpark of Ghent, Belgium. Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii was found in two of the Lasius neglectus nests studied. In one of the two C. albinus was also discovered. In the localities where the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus was introduced, as is also the case in the Citadelpark in Ghent, it out-competes all native ant species. This ant has a dramatic effect on the local native ant fauna. However, some of the myrmecophilous species associated with the native ant-fauna are less threatened as they are accepted by this invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} {{process of}} the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius neglectus in Europe and Asia is described in terms of: a) local expansion through colony growing measured on four supercolonies (Seva, Debrecen, Buda Castle and Budattny) from two distant and climatically different countries (Spain, Hungary), and b) regional expansion, using data from all published and several new non-native localities. Short, local distance processes (few meters to 89 m year- 1), as colony budding, are two to five orders of magnitude smaller than long regional distances (ten km to > 1000 km). This suggests direct human intervention in the invasive spread. The regional trend also shows that the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> has been quickly and steadily {{increasing the number of}} non native localities (77) and countries (14) it has reached during the last 30 years...|$|E

40|$|The Müller-Lyer {{illusion}} is {{a classical}} geometric illusion {{in which the}} apparent (perceived) length of a line depends on whether the line terminates in an arrow tail or arrowhead.

Here, we show that the Müller-Lyer illusion can also be produced by the foraging patterns of <b>garden</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius niger) and that the pattern obtained can be explained by a simple, asynchronously updated foraging ant model. Our results suggest that the geometric illusion may be a byproduct of the foraging process, in which local interactions underlying efficient exploitation can also give rise to global exploration, and that visual information processing in human could implement similar modulation between local efficient processing and widespread computation...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) {{has been}} spreading rapidly in Europe {{ever since the}} 1990 s. This ant established enormous supercolonies in many European cities and poses {{a serious threat to}} the local native faunas. The spread of this species has not slowed down in the last decades, but in the recent years the sizes of the known L. neglectus populations have generally been declining or have stagnated, or they sometimes have disappeared entirely. Only rarely have they increased. In this paper, we summarize these monitoring data collected by the private, diligent monitoring activities of myrmecologists on populations of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Spain. The reasons for this collapse are thought to be: (1) depletion of the local resources, (2) gradation of pathogens and (social) parasites, (3) climatic factors, (4) intra-population mechanisms, (5) confrontation with highly competitive native species, (6) and lack of suitable nesting microhabitats. As similar phenomena were observed in the cases of supercolonies of other invasive ant species, it seems that they decline more generally than has been thought...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Exotic ants for the Canary Islands are examined.

Two species, Linepithema humile (argentine ant) and Paratrechina longicornis (crazy ant) exist in all of the islands. The detection of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus and its limited extent call for an eradication programme. This species, Paratrechina jaegerskioeldi and Tetramorium caldarium are new additions to the Canarian fauna...|$|E
40|$|Invasive ant species {{represent}} {{a serious threat}} to many ecological communities, often causing decreases in the abundance, species richness and diversity of native ants and other arthropods. The invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius neglectus VAN LOON, BOOMSMA & ANDRÁSFALVY, 1990, is an invasive tramp species that forms dense supercolonies. We studied the ecolo-gical impacts of the type supercolony of this species on other ants and surface-active arthropods in Budatétény, Budapest, Hungary. Arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity were estimated by using pitfall traps. The L. neglectus supercolony radically changed the composition of the arthropod assemblage. The diversity of total arthro-pods, Coleoptera and other Formicidae was lower in the areas with L. neglectus supercolony than in the control areas. The presence of L. neglectus caused a significant reduction in species richness of Isopoda and other Formicidae, but a signi-ficant increase in Hemiptera...|$|E
50|$|Leafcutter ants {{are very}} {{specialized}} organisms {{in that they}} coevolved with another organism through symbiosis. This process took millions of years to occur, about 50 million years ago, which is when these ants began their relationship with plants. The fungus eventually {{lost the ability to}} produce spores and the ants capitalized on that by making the fungus its main food source. About 66 million years ago, South America was isolated from other land masses, and this is when <b>gardening</b> <b>ants</b> started their relationship with a fungus. It has been hypothesized that leafcutter ants propagated the same fungal lineage for 25 million years, which means they caused the fungus to reproduce itself. The leafcutter ants are different from other ants by their underground fungi cultivation; they have not been thought to be derived from another ant, but they bear a resemblance to the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex.|$|R
40|$|SummaryTo fight {{infectious}} diseases, host {{immune defenses}} are employed at multiple levels. Sanitary behavior, such as pathogen avoidance and removal, {{acts as a}} {{first line of defense}} to prevent infection [1] before activation of the physiological immune system. Insect societies have evolved a wide range of collective hygiene measures and intensive health care toward pathogen-exposed group members [2]. One of the most common behaviors is allogrooming, in which nestmates remove infectious particles from the body surfaces of exposed individuals [3]. Here we show that, in invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ants,</b> grooming of fungus-exposed brood is effective beyond the sheer mechanical removal of fungal conidiospores; it also includes chemical disinfection through the application of poison produced by the ants themselves. Formic acid is the main active component of the poison. It inhibits fungal growth of conidiospores remaining on the brood surface after grooming and also those collected in the mouth of the grooming ant. This dual function is achieved by uptake of the poison droplet into the mouth through acidopore self-grooming and subsequent application onto the infectious brood via brood grooming. This extraordinary behavior extends the current understanding of grooming and the establishment of social immunity in insect societies...|$|R

40|$|Cofoundresses of {{the desert}} fungus <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Acromyrmex versicolor exhibit a forager {{specialist}} who subsumes all foraging risk prior to first worker eclosion (Rissing et al. 1989). In an experiment designed to mimic a "cheater" who refuses foraging assignment when her lot, cofoundresses delayed/failed to replace their forager, often leading to demise of their garden (Rissing et al. 1996). The cheater on task assignment is harmed, but so too is the punisher, as all will die without a healthy garden. In this paper we study through simulation the cofoundress interaction with haploid, asexual genotypes which either replace a cheater or not (punishment), under both foundress viscosity (likely for A. versicolor) and random assortment. We find replacement superior to punishment only {{when there is no}} foraging risk and cheating is not costly to group survival. Generally, punishment is evolutionarily superior, especially as forager risk increases, under both forms of dispersal. Cheater, punishment, evolution...|$|E
40|$|The common <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius niger {{use both}} trail pheromones and memory of past visits to {{navigate}} {{to and from}} food sources. In a recent paper we demonstrated a synergistic effect between route memory and trail pheromones: the presence of trail pheromones results in experienced ants walking straighter and faster. We also found that experienced ants leaving a pheromone trail deposit less pheromone. Here we focus on another finding of the experiment: the presence of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which are used as home range markers by ants, also affects pheromone deposition behavior. When walking on a trail on which CHCs are present but trail pheromones are not, experienced foragers deposit less pheromone on the outward journey than on the return journey. The regulatory mechanisms ants use during foraging and recruitment behavior is subtle and complex, affected by multiple interacting factors such as route memory, travel direction and the presence trail pheromone and home-range markings...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} {{forces that}} shape and maintain eusocial societies are an enduring puzzle in evolutionary biology. Ordinarily sterile workers can usually reproduce {{given the right}} conditions, so the factors regulating reproductive division of labour may provide insight into why eusociality has persisted over evolutionary time. Queen-produced pheromones that affect worker reproduction have been implicated in diverse taxa, including ants, termites, wasps and possibly mole rats, but to date have only been definitively identified in the honeybee. Using the black <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius niger, we isolate the first sterility-regulating ant queen pheromone. The pheromone is a cuticular hydrocarbon that comprises {{the majority of the}} chemical profile of queens and their eggs, and also affects worker behaviour, by reducing aggression towards objects bearing the pheromone. We further show that the pheromone elicits a strong response in worker antennae and that its production by queens is selectively reduced following an immune challenge. These results suggest that the pheromone has a central role in colony organization and support the hypothesis that worker sterility represents altruistic self-restraint in response to an honest quality signal...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{invertebrates}} such as ants {{are thought}} to be important manipulators of soils in temperate and tropical ecosystems. The fungus <b>gardening</b> <b>ant,</b> Trachymyrmex septentrionalis, is an important agent of biomantling, that is, of depositing soil excavated from below onto the surface, and has been suggested as an agent of bioturbation (moving soil below ground) as well. The amount of bioturbation by this ant was quantified by planting queenright colonies in sand columns consisting of 5 layers of different colored sand. The amount of each color of sand deposited on the surface was determined from April to November 2015. In November, colonies were excavated and the color and amount of sand deposited below ground (mostly as backfill in chambers) was determined. Extrapolated to one ha, T. septentrionalis deposited 800 kg of sand per annum on the surface, and an additional 200 kg (17 % of the total excavated) below ground. On average, this mixes 1. 3 % of the sand from other layers within the top meter of soil per millennium, but this mixing is unlikely to be homogeneous, and probably occurs as "hotspots" in both horizontal and vertical space. Such mixing is discussed as a challenge to sediment dating by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the formal}} {{description}} of fungi in the genus Escovopsis in 1990, {{only a few}} studies have focused on the systematics of this group. For more than two decades, only two Escovopsis species were described; however, in 2013, three additional Escovopsis species were formally described along with the genus Escovopsioides, both found exclusively in attine <b>ant</b> <b>gardens.</b> During a survey for Escovopsis species in gardens of the lower attine ant Mycetophylax morschi in Brazil, we found four strains belonging to the pink-colored Escovopsis clade. Careful examination of these strains revealed significant morphological differences when compared to previously described species of Escovopsis and Escovopsioides. Based on the type of conidiogenesis (sympodial), as well as morphology of conidiogenous cells (percurrent), non-vesiculated conidiophores, and DNA sequences, we describe the four new strains as a new species, Escovopsis kreiselii sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses using three nuclear markers (Large subunit RNA; translation elongation factor 1 -alpha; and internal transcribed spacer) from the new strains as well as available sequences in public databases confirmed that all known fungi infecting attine <b>ant</b> <b>gardens</b> comprise a monophyletic group within the Hypocreaceae family, with very diverse morphological characteristics. Specifically, Escovopsis kreiselii is likely associated with <b>gardens</b> of lower-attine <b>ants</b> and its pathogenicity remains uncertain...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLife in {{a social}} group {{increases}} the risk of disease transmission [1 – 3]. To counteract this threat, social insects have evolved manifold antiparasite defenses, ranging from social exclusion of infected group members to intensive care [2, 4]. It is generally assumed that individuals performing hygienic behaviors risk infecting themselves, suggesting a high direct cost of helping [4 – 6]. Our work instead indicates the opposite for <b>garden</b> <b>ants.</b> Social contact with individual workers, which were experimentally exposed to a fungal parasite, provided a clear survival benefit to nontreated, naive group members upon later challenge with the same parasite. This first demonstration of contact immunity in Social Hymenoptera and complementary results from other animal groups and plants [7 – 9] suggest its general importance in both antiparasite and antiherbivore defense. In addition to this physiological prophylaxis of adult ants, infection of the brood was prevented in our experiment by behavioral changes of treated and naive workers. Parasite-treated ants stayed away from the brood chamber, whereas their naive nestmates increased brood-care activities. Our findings reveal a direct benefit for individuals to perform hygienic behaviors toward others, and this might explain the widely observed maintenance of social cohesion under parasite attack in insect societies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany animals avoid {{attack from}} predators through {{toxicity}} or the emission of repellent chemicals. Defensive mimicry has evolved in many species to deceive shared predators, {{for instance through}} colouration and other morphological adaptations, but mimicry hardly ever seems to involve multi-trait similarities. Here we report on a wingless parasitoid wasp that exhibits a full spectrum of traits mimicing ants and affording protection against ground-dwelling predators (wolf spiders). In body size, morphology and movement Gelis agilis (Ichneumonidae) is highly similar to the black <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger) that shares the same habitat. When threatened, G. agilis also emits a volatile chemical {{that is similar to}} an ant-produced chemical that repels spiders. In bioassays with L. niger, G. agilis, G. areator, Cotesia glomerata and Drosophila melanogaster, ants and G. agilis were virtually immune to spider attack, in contrast the other species were not. Volatile characterisation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified G. agilis emissions as 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, a known insect defence semiochemical that acts as an alarm pheromone in ants. We argue that multi-trait mimicry, as observed in G. agilis, might be much more common among animals than currently realized...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{stress can}} lead to a {{decrease}} in the body size of insects. As social insects, ants have a complex caste system; each caste has its own morphological traits and functions in the colony, hence the effects of stress may manifest differentially among different ant castes. Here we investigated the body size of males of the common <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius niger L., 1758, living in a postmining area polluted mainly by Zn, Cd, and Pb. We examined if individual body size decreases with the pollution gradient. The ants were sampled from 39 wild colonies originating from 17 sites located along the metal pollution gradient; head width was used as the estimator of body size. We failed to show a significant correlation between pollution and male body size, indicating no direct effect of pollution on the body size of males of the investigated ant. However, we found a significant dependence with the colony of origin, which is in line with a previous study performed on this species in unpolluted sites. These results further strengthen a general conclusion that morphological traits in ants, such as body size or fluctuating asymmetry, are relatively invariable and stable across gradients of metal pollution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a map showing {{the area of}} the Debrecen supercolony of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius neglectus VAN LOON, BOOMSMA & ANDRÁSFALVY, 1990) in 1998, 2000, and 2002. Vegetation types are marked on the map. The presence of different ant species' nest entrances was also mapped in 10 cm long sections along a transect through the L. neglectus supercolony in 1998 and 2002. The expansion of L. neglectus was not equal in the different directions and in the different years. It seems that L. neglectus spreads fastest on paths, and does not spread rapidly in shady and cool areas occupied by coniferous bushes. Records showing isolated localities of L. neglectus colonies confirm that this spe-cies is budding. The data suggest that the relative L. niger (LINNAEUS, 1758) is more impacted by the invasion of L. neglectus than Tetramorium cf. caespitum (LINNAEUS, 1758). Moreover, Liometopum microcephalum (PANZER, 1798) and Lasius fuliginosus (LATREILLE, 1798) were able to completely defend their territory against L. neglectus. From 1998 to 2002, the number of 10 cm long sections containing L. neglectus nest entrances doubled, and the number of sec-tions unoccupied by any ant species decreased by half...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gardens</b> of fungus-growing <b>ants</b> (Formicidae: Attini) {{traditionally}} have been {{thought to be}} free of microbial parasites, with the fungal mutualist maintained in nearly pure “monocultures. ” We conducted extensive isolations of “alien” (nonmutualistic) fungi from <b>ant</b> <b>gardens</b> of a phylogenetically representative collection of attine ants. Contrary to the long-standing assumption that gardens are maintained free of microbial pathogens and parasites, they are in fact host to specialized parasites that are only known from attine gardens and that are found in most attine nests. These specialized garden parasites, belonging to the microfungus genus Escovopsis (Ascomycota: anamorphic Hypocreales), are horizontally transmitted between colonies. Consistent with theory of virulence evolution under this mode of pathogen transmission, Escovopsis is highly virulent and has the potential for rapid devastation of <b>ant</b> <b>gardens,</b> leading to colony mortality. The specialized parasite Escovopsis is more prevalent in gardens of the more derived ant lineages than in gardens of the more “primitive” (basal) ant lineages. Because fungal cultivars of derived attine lineages are asexual clones of apparently ancient origin whereas cultivars of primitive ant lineages were domesticated relatively recently from free-living sexual stocks, the increased virulence of pathogens associated with ancient asexual cultivars suggests an evolutionary cost to cultivar clonality, perhaps resulting from slower evolutionary rates of cultivars in the coevolutionary race with their pathogens...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ponerine ant Pachycondyla goeldii is a monogynous (i. e. one queen per colony) {{arboreal}} {{species that}} colonizes pioneer areas. Founding queens and first generation workers initiate their own <b>ant</b> <b>garden</b> {{by building a}} cardboard-like structure into which epiphyte seeds are integrated. Following {{the growth of the}} epiphyte, the colony establishes its nest within the root system. This particular nest-building behavior is crucial in an environment where suitable nest sites are rare. Nevertheless, the slow growing process of <b>ant</b> <b>gardens</b> does not allow this species to readily evacuate and find another refuge in the advent of an attack by a predator or worsening climatic conditions. Previous field studies of P. goeldii were performed after forest destruction and subsequent colonization by P. goeldii. As a result, the colonies studied where relatively young and monodomous (i. e. one nest per colony). Our study of nest composition, worker exchanges between <b>ant</b> <b>gardens</b> in the field, and dyadic encounters shows that mature colonies of P. goeldii are polydomous (i. e. multiple nests per colony). In ants, the association of polydomy with monogyny has infrequently been reported. To our knowledge, P. goeldii represents the first record of a Ponerinae exhibiting both these particular characteristics. Our field and laboratory experiments suggest that polydomy is adaptively advantageous in coping with the microclimatic instability of pioneer areas by providing colonies with easily accessible nests...|$|R
