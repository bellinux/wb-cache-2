40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} topological <b>pressure</b> <b>dimension</b> for almost {{additive}} sequences, which is an extension of topological entropy dimension. We investigate fundamental properties of the topological <b>pressure</b> <b>dimension</b> for almost additive sequences. In particular, we study the relationships among different types of topological <b>pressure</b> <b>dimension</b> and identifies an inequality relating them. Also, we show that the topological <b>pressure</b> <b>dimension</b> is always equal to or greater than 1 for certain special almost additive sequence.

A method is developed for predicting the pressure-time response of a volume subjected to subsonic air flow through from one to four passages. The pressure calculation is based on one-dimensional gas flow with friction. A computed program has been developed which solves the differential equations using a self-starting predictor-corrector integration technique. The input data required are the <b>pressure</b> sensing system <b>dimensions,</b> <b>pressure</b> forcing function(s) at the inlet port(s), and a trajectory over the time of analysis (altitude-velocity-time), if the forcing function is trajectory dependent.

Boys and girls with earlier maternal menarcheal age (MMA) have shown greater height and body mass index (BMI) in childhood. Aim: To analyse associations of menarcheal age with their own and their children's anthropometric <b>dimensions</b> and blood <b>pressure.</b> Subjects and methods: The sample consisted of 493 women and their children (aged 2 - 19 years) from Greater Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain).

40|$|The {{number of}} allowed {{configurations}} of a polymer {{is reduced by}} the presence of a repulsive surface resulting in an entropic force between them. We develop a method to calculate the entropic force, and detailed pressure distribution, for long ideal polymers near a scale-free repulsive surface. For infinite polymers the monomer density is related to the electrostatic potential near a conducting surface of a charge placed {{at the point where the}} polymer end is held. Pressure of the polymer on the surface is then related to the charge density distribution in the electrostatic problem. We derive explicit expressions for pressure distributions and monomer densities for ideal polymers near a two- or three-dimensional wedge, and for a circular cone in three <b>dimensions.</b> <b>Pressure</b> of the polymer diverges near sharp corners in a manner resembling (but not identical to) the electric field divergence near conducting surfaces.

40|$|Temporal {{dynamics}} of gas-filled spherical bubbles are often described using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, {{a special case}} of the Navier-Stokes equations that describes the oscillations of a spherical cavity in an infinite incompressible fluid. While analytical approximations and numerical simulations have previously been given in some parameter regimes, {{we are able to}} completely classify all possible dynamics exactly, in terms of only the model parameters. We present an analytical study of the solutions to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in any number of spatial dimensions, and we demonstrate that the possible behaviors of solutions include bubbles of constant radius, bubbles with temporally oscillating radius, and bubbles with finite time collapse. Each of these behaviors can be predicted solely in terms of the spatial <b>dimension,</b> <b>pressures</b> acting on the bubble, and initial strain. In the case of oscillating bubbles, we give the amplitude and period of these oscillations in terms of an integral which {{is a function of the}} aforementioned parameters, while when the bubble collapses, we can similarly give the time of collapse in terms of these parameters. We give a systematic study of all possible behaviors, and capture special case solutions presented numerically or asymptotically in the literature.

While flexibility orientation negatively moderates the effects of coercive pressures and positively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures, control orientation positively moderates the effects of coercive and normative pressures and negatively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{predicting}} downward flame spread characteristics over poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with different sample <b>dimensions</b> in different <b>pressure</b> environments. Three-dimensional (3 -D) downward flame spread experiments on free PMMA slabs were conducted at five locations with different altitudes, which provide different pressures. Pressure effects on the flame spread rate, profile of pyrolysis front and flame height were analyzed at all altitudes. The flame spread rate in the steady-state stage was calculated based on the balance on the fuel surface and fuel properties. Results show that flame spread rate increases exponentially with pressure, and the exponent of pressure further shows an increasing trend with {{the thickness of the}} sample. The angle of the pyrolysis front emerged on sample residue in the width direction, which indicates a steady-burning stage, varies clearly with sample thicknesses and ambient pressures. A global non-dimensional equation was proposed to predict the variation tendency of the angle of the pyrolysis front with pressure and was found to fit well with the measured results.
