40|$|Food and {{beverage}} business provider wide-spread {{in the city}} of Semarang. Judging from the quantity, micro businesses in the fields of food {{and beverage}} provider has more significant numbers when compared to businesses with large scale or the middle scale. However, development of micro-businesses still has many obstacles such as lack of fund, low levels of human resources and lack of awareness to build good relationships towards suppliers, whereas the supplier holds important role in business success. Added with the large number of existing business competitors, it requiresdomination to compete of each business in order to survive in the existing competitive conditions. This research’s objectives are to test the influence of information sharing, long term relationship and process integration against the competitive advantage of food and beverage business in UNDIP Tembalang with supplier and buyer relationship performance as <b>intervenning.</b> Taking a sample of 100 respondents with simple random sampling technique selecting respondents who are micro business of food and beverage provider around UNDIP, Tembalang. The method of data analysis used is multiple regression analysis, where the analysis consists of: validity test, reliability test, classical assumption test, multiple linear regression test, t test, F test, determination test and Sobel test. The result of multiple regression shows that the variable of information sharing (0, 546), long term relationship (0, 304) and process integration (0, 136) have positive and significant influence to <b>intervenning</b> variable that is supplier and buyer relationship performance.

This research was conducted to consumers who ever make a purchase in Wardah cosmetics, where the respondents in this study is the student of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Diponegoro in the academic year of 2013 - 2016. The number of samples in this research as much as 131 respondents. With the method of collecting data through questionnaires and sampling method in this research is non probability sampling with purposive sampling technique. This research uses the Partial Least Square analysis techniques, which are being estimated by the program SmartPLS 2. 0. A Summary of this research in that the perception of product quality, attractiveness of promotions, brand ambassador and brand image as an <b>intervenning</b> variable have an effect direcrly and indirectly against the purchasing decisions. Brand image is the factor that most affect consumers in making purchasing decisions. So the higher the brand image of a product then the higher the purchasing decisions of consumers on such products.

The Brazilian Northeast is the third larger region of Brazil, with 1. 548. 672 Km 2 and has about 60 % (900, 000 Km 2) {{recovered}} by the Bioma Caatinga. The disordered exploration of the vegetal biodiversity in the Brazil’s Northeast region will bring losses of valuable therapeutical substances and also important genes that codify enzimes of potential use in the biosynthetic studies of new natural products. The P. angulata specie belongs to the Solanaceae family, in the popular medicine, {{it has been used}} as anticoagulating, antileucemic, antimutagenic and its fruits is used as feeding. Besides, the angico A. colubrina specie of the Mimosaceae family is used as tanniniferous, melliferous and medicinal treatment of respiratory illnesses, ulcers and diarrhea. Because of the great importance of these two species, it had been made physiological and agronomic studies, objectifying bigger scientific knowledge and making possible its sustainable uses and its conservation, since they are considered, under extinguishing threat by the book Flora da Bahia.

40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{application}} of the nailing technique to excavations. The first part centers around the analysis of the different aspects of reinforced soils' behaviour, with a particular emphasis on the nailing technique, whose features, field of application and place within soil improvement and reinforced methods are described (Ch. 1). Ch. 2 discusses the behaviour of reinforced soils and the way this is affected by the mechanical and geometrical features of the constituent parts. The main mechanisms of interaction <b>intervenning</b> in a number of reinforcing systems are analysed in detail in Ch. 3. Finally, Ch. 4 reviews the published data on the behaviour of actual works, discusses the problems involved in the design of these structures based on limite state equilibrium considerations and intriduces a method based upon this rationale. The second part analyses in detail the nailing system's working mechanisms with the help of 2 - and 3 - dimensional numerical models developed, using the finite elements method, specifically for the study of reinforcing systems. The models are presented in Chs. 5 and 7 respectively. The 2 -dimensional non-linear model is then applied in the analysis of in turn the general behaviour of nailed excavations (Ch. 6); the influence of the parameters which specify the properties of the materials and of the interfaces, as well as the geometry of the systems (Ch. 8); and the consequences of the construction process on soil blok movements (Ch. 9). This chapter also develops some methodologies aiming at reducing those movements. The 3 -dimensional model, on the other hand, is used in the study of some aspects of the soil-nails interaction which cannot be brought into light through bidimensional analysis (Ch. 7). This model is further applied in the study of corner effects in excavations and in the clarification of the conditions under which bidimensional analysis is not adequate (Ch. 10). The two models are then tested through a comparison of there results with actual data from a big nail-reinforced excavation (Ch. 11). The problem of the rupture of nailed walls is also discusses, albeit in a simple and onesided way (Ch. 12) [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
