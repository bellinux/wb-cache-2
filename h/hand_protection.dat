25|$|The use of <b>hand</b> <b>protection</b> in {{fighting}} contests undertaken for sport {{has been known}} since Ancient Greece. However, the gloves were very {{different from those of}} modern boxing, as was the sport itself. In Ancient Greece, it was common practice to tie strips of rawhide round the hands for protection. In Roman times, this developed into the gladiatorial cestus, with metal added to the gloves to inflict greater damage. The brutality of the sport caused the boxing to be banned in AD 393.|$|E

[...] The introduction of the plastic heads in the 1970s gave players an alternative to the wooden stick, and their mass production has led to greater accessibility and expansion of the sport.|$|E

40|$|Most hand anthropometric {{studies are}} {{performed}} on the palmar aspect, while dimensions of the dorsal aspect are also useful in ergonomics and hand modelling. A survey of hand anthropometrics for a Spanish population (69 females, 70 males) is presented. Landmarks were selected to compare lengths from the dorsal and palmar aspects and to be useful for hand modelling and ergonomics design. Ninety-nine dimensions of fingers and thumb of the right hand (41 lengths, 32 depths, 26 breadths) were collected, including thumb breadths and depths. Descriptive statistics of all the dimensions are presented. Lengths were measured from both dorsal and palmar aspects and paired lengths compared through T-tests. Significant {{differences were found in}} almost all the lengths, showing that databases should explicitly state the aspect (dorsal or palmar) where dimensions have been measured.
