25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} in a proto-fascist ballroom where {{gigantic}} torchieres gripped by fists recall those of Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête. It commences {{with the arrival of the}} Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly <b>degenerates</b> <b>into</b> a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart, the Private Secretary, in black leather pants, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.|$|E
25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion <b>degenerates</b> <b>into</b> what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Republic. This {{regime is}} {{ruled by a}} philosopher king, and thus is {{grounded}} on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses {{throughout much of the}} Republic, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. In his description, Plato has Sparta in mind. Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control. In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes. Democracy then <b>degenerates</b> <b>into</b> tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.|$|E
