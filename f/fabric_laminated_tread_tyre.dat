In this work, an attempt {{has been made to}} drill micro-holes in carbon <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate</b> composites using 320 mm diameter carbide drills. Based on a preliminary study, drilling strategy with peck cycle is chosen for through-hole drilling in carbon <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate.</b> Micro-drilling experiments are conducted according to full-factorial design using five levels for both speed and feed with three trials for each condition.

This allows us to apply the homogenization theory for periodic media both to the yarn and to the fabric. Three-dimensional finite element models are used in two steps to predict both the stiffness {{and the strength of}} a glass woven <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate.</b> The model includes all the important parameters that influence the mechanical behaviour: the lamina thickness, the yarn orientation, the fiber volume fraction and the mechanical characteristics of the components. The capabilities of the numerical model were verified studying the elastic behaviour of a woven <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate</b> available in the literature and the ultimate strength of a glass <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate</b> experimentally investigated. The procedure, that can be implemented into commercial finite element codes, appears to be an efficient tool for the design of textile composites...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{woven fabric}} {{composite}} models were {{developed for the}} elastic analysis of WF composites in Part I of this paper. The effect of undulation of yarn and fabric thickness on the elastic properties of woven fabric lamina was studied. The study was extended to woven <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> {{and the effect of}} laminate configuration on the elastic properties was analyzed in Part II. In the present paper, the effect of pp between two adjacent yams on the elastic properties of woven fabric lamina and the effect of laminate configuration for different number of layers on the elastic properties of woven <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> for different material systems are studied. An optimum gap between adjacent yams gives higher Young's moduli, and it depends upon the fabric structure and material system. A basic building block is found which gives higher elastic properties than with any other configuration with the same number of layers. Such a basic building block can then be used for making thicker laminates. The comparison of woven <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> with UD cross-ply laminates indicated that, in general, the material system with lower degree of orthotropy is desirable for woven fabric composites...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh {{performance}} fiber fabrics {{are widely}} used in whipple structures to resist hypervelocity impact (HVI) of man-made debris or meteorites. Evaluation of the shielding performance of fabric-reinforced composites poses a great challenge when considering the local feature of fiber compression and damage under shock loading. A momentum diagnostic approach is developed in this paper to quantitatively determine the characteristics of momentum distribution of a debris cloud, which lays the basis for assessing a whipple shield. Efforts {{have been made to}} bring forward a systematic scheme for quantitative evaluation of a whipple shield. The bumper of a whipple is evaluated by measuring the spatial distribution of a debris cloud resulted from projectile/bumper collision. For a rear wall resisting discrete impacts of a debris cloud, two experimental schemes are applied consisting of micro fragments impact test to assess the material toughness against fragment penetrations, and planar impact test to evaluate the capability of energy absorption. Comprehensive tests were performed for <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> and aluminum alloy coupons. It is evidenced that <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> has the advantages of separating into fine fragments at collision speeds of 4 - 6 km/s, and of reducing efficiently the shock intensity under a short shock pulse, not to mention its extremely high strength in nature. Hence, <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> is of excellent selections both for a bumper and a rear wall.

40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry {{is committed to}} improving the performance of aircraft whilst reducing emissions and weight. Part of this goal can be achieved {{with the use of}} new types of composite materials, such as non-crimp fabric composites. These new composites, still under development, are made from dry fabrics and combine in theory the excellent in-plane behaviour of the unidirectional pre-impregnated tape composites with better out-of-plane behaviour and lower cost of the woven fabric composites. In practice, however, due to several parameters associated with the different stages of manufacturing of the non-crimp <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates,</b> some in-plane and out-of-plane waviness at the mesoscopic scale is introduced. This waviness (typically called crimp) is responsible for lowering the in-plane behaviour and causing specific failure models. A new method to efficiently model the fibre crimp of the tows in mesoscopic scale 3 D finite element models of non-crimp <b>fabric</b> <b>laminates</b> is presented in this study. This method consists of modelling the fibre crimp using straight meshes and “rotating” the mechanical properties according to the actual direction of the fibres. In order to ensure the validity of this method, it has been compared with previously developed methods in which the mesh is curved along the fibres direction. The new method allowed the creation of complex parametric 3 D FE models which in turn have been used to predict the apparent in-plane stiffness properties and to study the compressive behaviour and the in-plane shear behaviour of a non-crimp <b>fabric</b> <b>laminate...</b>|$|R

40|$|The regular <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> {{pattern design}} process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. From these <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> patter design process...|$|R
