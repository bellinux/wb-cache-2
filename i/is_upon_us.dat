500|$|In cinema, the 2009 {{disaster}} film 2012 {{was inspired}} by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a stealth marketing campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional [...] "Institute for Human Continuity" [...] called on people to prepare {{for the end of the}} world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic. Although the campaign was heavily criticized, the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770million worldwide. An article in The Daily Telegraph attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building [...] "survival arks". Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth. Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of Magnolia Pictures said in a press release, [...] "As the 2012 apocalypse <b>is</b> <b>upon</b> <b>us,</b> it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".|$|E
500|$|Perot {{employed}} a massive marketing strategy, spending $34.8 {{million to buy}} half hour and hour segments on major television networks, memorably using charts to illustrate his ideas for the economy. His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that [...] "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle." [...] He later concluded that [...] "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody {{steps up to the}} plate and accepts responsibility for anything." [...] He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While the Cold War is ending another war <b>is</b> <b>upon</b> <b>us.</b> In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams." [...] A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9.|$|E

It is recited {{at the end of}} each of the three daily Jewish services. It is also recited following the New Moon blessing and after a circumcision is performed. It is second only to the Kaddish (counting all its forms) as the most frequently recited prayer in current synagogue liturgy.|$|E
2500|$|The Chattanooga Times Free Press {{reported}} on 25 March 2013 that Georgia senators approved House Resolution 4 stating that if Tennessee declines to settle with them, the dispute will {{be handed over}} to the attorney general, who will take Tennessee before the Supreme Court to settle the issue once and for all. [...] The Atlantic Wire, in commenting on Georgia's actions stated: The Great Georgia-Tennessee Border War of 2013 <b>Is</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>Us</b> Historians, take note: On this day, which is not a day in 1732, a boundary dispute between two Southern states took a turn for the wet. In a two-page resolution passed overwhelmingly by the state senate, Georgia declared that it, not its neighbor to the north, controls part of the Tennessee River at Nickajack. Georgia doesn't want Nickajack. It wants that water..|$|E
2500|$|Many LDS Church {{leaders have}} {{expressed}} {{their views on}} the subject of meat. In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, [...] "Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold." [...] In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, [...] "We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter." [...] From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits. In 1895, Snow stated, [...] "Unless famine or extreme cold <b>is</b> <b>upon</b> <b>us</b> we should refrain from the use of meat." [...] Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee. When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the [...] "unnecessary destruction of life", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them [...]|$|E
