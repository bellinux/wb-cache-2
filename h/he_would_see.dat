5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

25|$|Having {{graduated}} from the Versailles military academy as a sub-lieutenant, he was posted to Mauritania in 1909, remaining there until 1912. Psichari initially feared {{that he would be}} bored in an area of the French colonies that was relatively pacified but soon grew to love the landscape and people of Mauritania. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> action in a skirmish with tribesmen in which two of his men were killed.|$|E
25|$|From {{early in}} his career, Alma-Tadema was {{particularly}} concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> at museums – such as the British Museum in London – in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed {{an enormous number of}} photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy in the details of his compositions.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance in East of Eden, Dean was nominated posthumously for the 1956 Academy Awards as Best Actor in a Leading Role of 1955, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history. (Jeanne Eagels was nominated for Best Actress in 1929, when the rules for selection of the winner were different.) East of Eden was the only film starring Dean that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> released in his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Early 626, the Tujue {{attacked}} {{the frontier of}} the Tang empire. At Li Jiancheng's recommendation, Li Yuanji was commissioned for a military campaign against these hostile forces, thus Li Shimin's best generals and crack troops were transferred to Li Yuanji. Thereafter, Li Shimin received word from his men that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had taken preparations to assassinate him when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> off Li Yuanji as was the custom during the onset of a military campaign.|$|E
25|$|Walton's {{troubles}} {{first began}} {{when he began to}} flip-flop between those progressives who supported his programs and those conservatives who did not. Walton began to lose control of the Legislature and by trying to appeal to both sides, lost all support. Hoping to regain his lost support, Walton attempted to gain factional support by making appointments of the faction leaders to the higher level government and educational positions. Though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> minor success in this venture, in the long term this proved to be ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Vincent Preissnitz {{was the son}} of {{a peasant}} farmer who, as a young child, {{observed}} a wounded deer bathing a wound in a pond near his home. Over the course of several days, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> this deer return and eventually the wound was healed. Later as a teenager, Preissnitz was attending to a horse cart, when the cart ran him over, breaking three of his ribs. A physician told him that they would never heal. Preissnitz decided to try his own hand at healing himself, and wrapped his wounds with damp bandages. By daily changing his bandages and drinking large quantities of water, after about a year, his broken ribs had been cured. Preissnitz quickly gained fame in his hometown and became the consulted physician.|$|E

25|$|With {{one year}} left {{to run on}} his {{contract}} Villeneuve turned down a lucrative offer to spend a season racing in CART before returning to BAR for 2004 and 2005, a deal which Villeneuve claimed was spoken about but never actually produced for him to sign. Instead, he decided that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> out his present deal {{in the hope of}} landing a role at another Grand Prix team the following year. The Canadian was joined by Jenson Button from Renault in 2003 as Panis was offered a drive at the Toyota which the Frenchman took. Button would prove to become the second of Villeneuve's teammates to outscore him in the Drivers' Championship as, unlike the Canadian, the Briton was able to score consistently with the BAR 005, finishing in the points every two races on average.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the child {{psychiatry}} unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticipated}} success {{failed to}} materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With {{over a year}} still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player Kevin Sheedy. So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the Brisbane Bears. Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears' ex-coach Robert Walls for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, Robert Walls became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under Jeff Gieschen, the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain Danny Frawley. After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley's second season, Richmond overestimated {{the strength of the}} list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> out his contract, {{a far cry from the}} way many of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons' end.|$|E
