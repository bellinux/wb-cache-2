5|$|As Plato tells it, the heckler {{hails from}} the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that {{it is true that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been famous if he had come from that small island, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} to Vaes Dothrak with Drogo's khalasar, Jorah Mormont reveals to Viserys that he was exiled for selling poachers to slavers. Viserys assures Jorah that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been punished if Viserys had been the king and {{demonstrates}} impatience for Drogo to lend Viserys his army.|$|E
5|$|The {{civilian}} posse {{arrived at}} the battleground as the fighting finished. Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to share the glory or the spoils of war.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, {{the ladies}} of Hallifax {{launched}} a subscription to celebrate the crew of HMS Boston. On the other hand, the population of New York had a golden medal made in honour of the crew of Embuscade; Bompart accepted the medal on the condition <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to wear it, as the National Convention had banned medals.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} {{the bulk of the}} Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|José Fernández {{grew up in}} Santa Clara, Cuba. There, {{he lived}} on the same street as, and was friends with, future Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop Aledmys Díaz. They played for the same youth {{baseball}} team, and Díaz's father and uncle encouraged Fernández's mother {{to bring him to}} the ballpark. Fernández commented that had Díaz's uncle not been an influence early in his life, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> pursued a professional baseball career.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did he believe? When he {{read that}} article, {{did he see}} in it a true rebuke against a hypocrite, or did he see in it a scurrilous attack upon a brother clergyman, a neighbour, and a friend? If the latter, <b>he</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been instigated by it to write to me such a letter as he did. <b>He</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sent the paper to me had he felt it to contain a foul-mouthed calumny." ...|$|R
50|$|Williams apologized {{again after}} {{he learned of}} his punishment, and said he hoped to return to {{coaching}} in the future. However, Fisher said that neither he nor the Rams knew about the bounty program, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> hired Williams had he known that Williams might be facing a year's suspension.|$|R

5|$|Keyes {{supports}} {{an amendment}} to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> gone to war in Iraq, but also said that the war was justified and defended President George W. Bush's decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2012, Alessandro Del Piero {{signed a}} two-year deal with Sydney FC. He was paid {{approximately}} AU$3.5million {{for each of}} his first two seasons, and therefore became the highest-paid footballer to ever play in Australia. Del Piero had been linked to Liverpool prior to signing for Sydney, but later revealed due to his memories of Heysel <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able {{to move to the}} club.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} he'd been back a couple o' days George Dixon {{could see that}} 'is going away 'adn't done any good at all. Nobody seemed to take any notice of 'im or wot he said, and at last, arter {{a word or two}} with Charlie about the rough way he spoke to some o' the customers, Charlie came in to Mrs. Dixon and said that he was at 'is old tricks of interfering, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>'ave</b> it.|$|R

50|$|In 1975 Giscard {{pressured}} the future King of Spain Juan Carlos to leave Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet {{out of his}} coronation ceremony by stating that if Pinochet attended <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Having</b> been told by Juan Carlos not to attend the coronation, Pinochet left Spain having only attended the funeral of Francisco Franco during his visit. Although France received many Chilean political refugees, it also secretly collaborated with Pinochet. French journalist Marie-Monique Robin has shown how Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly collaborated with Videla's junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile.|$|R
5|$|Having made {{considerable}} progress {{over the}} previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> time as president to complete it. There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E

2500|$|Chen Shou, {{who wrote}} Ma Chao's {{biography}} in the Sanguozhi, {{commented on the}} latter as such: [...] "Ma Chao's arrogance and overestimation of his ability caused the extermination of his entire clan. What a great pity! If he had been content with what <b>he</b> possessed, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> saved himself from disaster?" ...|$|R
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> included these supernatural scenes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash to the point where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to continue racing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{go along}} the path athwart which the Chinaman hung. <b>He</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>have</b> trees round him any more, {{and that it would}} be more {{comfortable}} to be quite close to the sociable splash and uproar of the rapids.|$|R
50|$|On 5 May 2011 despite {{breaking}} into the Coventry City first team, albeit due to injuries, Quirke was informed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>having</b> his contract renewed and {{would be free to}} leave the club once his current deal expired.|$|R
5000|$|Sergei Rachmaninoff also {{composed}} a symphonic poem, Isle of the Dead, Op. 29 (1909), {{inspired by a}} black-and-white print of the painting. He said that had he seen the colour original, <b>he</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> written the music.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E
50|$|Rava says, if {{he knows}} which day he {{departed}} on the journey, he may do work {{on the same day}} of the week 7 or 14 days after he departed, because <b>he</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> departed on a Sabbath.|$|R
60|$|Oswald galloped {{on to the}} end of the village, {{leapt from}} his horse, and threw the reins to Roger, who had been muttering words that <b>he</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> found in the missals, or the books, of the monastery.|$|R
