30|$|In {{situated}} collaboration, spoken {{natural language}} {{is often used}} to refer to task-relevant objects in the form of <b>installments.</b> <b>Installments</b> are chunks of information uttered by a speaker to provide partial information to the listener in an incremental manner. Human speakers may produce <b>installments</b> without planning an entire unambiguous utterance. This effect is increased when they are under time pressure (Striegnitz et al. 2012). Using <b>installments,</b> speakers can quickly adapt to changes in the surroundings and in particular to the listeners’ feedback and actions. As shown by Zarrieß and Schlangen (2016), an artificial speaker can use <b>installments</b> to generate referring expressions effectively. This was considered intuitive and enhanced the identification of real objects depicted in static images.|$|R
