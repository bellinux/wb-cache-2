5|$|Given {{the lack}} of a living will, a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer during the week of January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court in 1990.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E

5|$|The 1905 the Florida Legislature {{passed the}} Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into {{a school for}} white males (University of the State of Florida), a school for white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the {{character}} of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the intent of the Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.|$|E
25|$|On remand, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court {{issued an}} opinion on December 22, 2000, that did not dispute whether December 12 was the {{deadline}} for recounts under state law, although this was disputed in a concurring opinion by <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court Justice Leander Shaw who nevertheless expressed deference to the U.S. Supreme Court's view on this issue and who also argued that, in any case, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court would (in his opinion) be unable to craft a remedy which would satisfy all of the U.S. Supreme Court's equal protection, due process, and other concerns.|$|E

5000|$|In recent decades, however, governments {{blurred the}} lines {{between public and private}} {{nuisance}} causes of action. William Prosser noted this in 1966 and warned courts and scholars against confusing and merging the substantive laws of the two torts. In some states, his warning went unheeded and some courts and legislatures have created vague and ill-defined definitions to describe what constitutes a public nuisance. For example, <b>Florida's</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court has held that a public nuisance is any thing that causes [...] "annoyance to the community or harm to public health." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1983, Clarence E. Hill {{was convicted}} {{of the murder of}} a Pensacola, Florida police officer, and {{subsequently}} sentenced to death in 1985, in the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court case of Hill v. State. At a resentencing hearing in 1986, Hill’s death sentence was reinstated, this time being upheld by the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. In November 1989, a warrant for Hill’s execution was signed by then Governor Robert Martinez, after which Hill sought postconviction relief in both the Florida state courts and the U.S. District Court. In 1992, Hill’s relief was granted when it was ruled that the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court as well as Hill’s trial court had not properly reevaluated the aggravating factors warranting a death sentence when one of them was vacated. In Hill v. State, the <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court, having sufficiently reweighed the mitigating factors, resentenced Hill to death. Hill then sought federal habeas corpus relief, which was first denied by the U.S. District Court, then affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Florida</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court {{decision}} was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore. (2000) In a per curiam decision, by a 7-2 vote, the Court in Bush v.

By a 5–4 vote, the US Supreme Court held that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida.|$|E
