5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E

5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> a moral intuition based on {{utilitarian}} principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought).

5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program.

5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E
5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had the thickest, most extensive manes amongst wild lions. Research results indicate that environmental factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E

5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, Sega {{began to}} develop an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega 32X, which {{would serve as a}} less-expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The {{decision}} to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch {{by the end of the}} year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X served a role in assisting development teams to familiarize themselves with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be <b>justified</b> <b>by</b> the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{discount}} rate is central in project evaluation, all the more since the project?s horizon is distant. The controversy about the appropriate discount rate {{has been given a}} new life about environmental projects, characterized by very remote costs and/or benefits, reduced to a trivial level by discounting. This paper is a survey of the recent literature on discounting and the environment. The. rst proposal in this literature consists in replacing the usual social welfare function, namely the discounted utilitarian one, by another social welfare criterion, based on intergenerational equity issues. The second approach is descriptive rather than prescriptive, and <b>justifies</b> <b>by</b> psychological considerations the use of a time-decreasing pure rate of time preference. The third approach <b>justifies</b> <b>by</b> future uncertainty the use of a time-decreasing consumption social discount rate. We underline that {{it is very difficult to}} determine the ?good? procedure for choosing a discount rate. The arguments that lead to adopt a time-decreasing social consumption discount rate are nevertheless very convincing, and the paper argues in favour of this approach. ...|$|R
