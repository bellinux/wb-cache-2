25|$|The attack, {{originally}} planned {{to begin in}} May, was delayed until July. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a week before Soviet pressures on the Orel salient {{to the north and}} the necessity to respond to the allied invasion of Sicily resulted in the operation being halted. The Soviets then seized the initiative, which they held {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell {{came from}} Birmingham, England and fought Sullivan in 1883, {{knocking}} {{him down in}} the first round. Their third meeting took place in 1888 {{on the grounds of}} a chateau at Chantilly, France, with the fight held in driving rain. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> more than two hours, {{at the end of which}} both men were unrecognisable and had suffered much loss of blood; neither could lift his arms to punch and the contest was considered a draw.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{fighting}} started, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> forty-eight days. The wall {{was beginning to}} collapse when Constantine {{sent a letter to}} the pope asking for help. In response the pope sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. The Ottoman ships burnt the Byzantine ones in a naval battle.|$|E

500|$|Several of the {{allusions to}} Smithers' {{sexuality}} {{have turned into}} battles with the censors. For example, in Smithers' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in [...] "Rosebud", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is [...] "Marge Gets a Job", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed [...] "Mr. Burns land in a particular position on Smithers' anatomy". There were also issues with [...] "the lump in his bed", which the animators said had drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.|$|E
2500|$|As from May 2010 Clapton {{was writing}} his autobiography, which {{he hoped would}} appear later that year. He told Moran of The Sunday Telegraph, [...] "I have no regrets about {{anything}} in my life. It {{has been a very}} colourful ride. I don't want to homogenise and pasteurise this book because I don't have any regrets about anything I've done in my life". Clapton and Susie were divorced by July 2012. He told Paul Cashmere of Noise11.com [...] "I went through a really miserable divorce ... I wrote a couple of songs like 'Over the Borderline' which was a last ditch attempt to make amends with my ex-wife. The divorce got very long and drawn out. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> about five years which is just absurd". On 1 August 2014 Clapton wrote his autobiography, The Best Years of Our Lives, which was published by Allen & Unwin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after a while, we did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".|$|E

50|$|The Quran {{possesses}} {{an external}} appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning (this depth possesses a depth, after {{the image of}} the celestial Spheres, which are enclosed within each other). So <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth).|$|R

5000|$|A {{reviewer}} in The Canberra Times {{noted the}} risks of writing about so recent an event, and then worried {{about the length of}} the book: [...] "In any fictional treatment of a controversial and still remembered incident of history, it is almost impossible for the writer to avoid taking sides with some of his characters...Although Aldridge introduces many characters into his story and draws a canvas with numerous events, it would seem he has overdone it by letting <b>it</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 790 pages." ...|$|R
