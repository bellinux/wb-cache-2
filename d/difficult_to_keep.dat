5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, made it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E
5|$|All {{families}} {{had their own}} gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep.</b> Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution and it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them all straight.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, but it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, {{and it may be}} possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most attractive Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Israel, and trialled in France, Spain and South America. Its striking terminal inflorescences and furry new growth are its main horticultural attributes. However, it is highly sensitive to dieback and succumbs readily when exposed. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> alive in areas of heavy soils or summer rainfall or humidity, such as the Australian east coast. Furthermore, flowering may be sparse or not occur when cultivated in warmer climates such as Perth. Pruning promotes branching, which leads to more flower spikes being produced.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce {{exploited}} {{his victory}} at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into Lancashire and Yorkshire, even threatening York itself. Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign {{to stem the}} advance in 1319, but the famine made it increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his garrisons supplied with food. Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert's brother successfully invaded Ireland in 1315, where Edward Bruce declared himself the King of Ireland. He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the Battle of Faughart, and Edward Bruce's severed head {{was sent back to}} the King. Revolts also broke out in Lancashire and Bristol in 1315, and in Glamorgan in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
