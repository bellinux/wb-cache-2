50|$|The black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> is a {{predator}} {{of the brown}} howler monkey. The roars of the brown howler allow the black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> to determine their location. The brown howler’s response has three parts. First, when one brown howler becomes aware of a black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> they will alarm the group {{and then they will}} immediately become silent. Next they descend in the understory of the trees, and finally they will all disperse in an organized manner. The adults will lead the young away from danger. The young are considered to be the primary target for the black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle.</b> There is a more conservative response when adult brown howlers are without the young, and the black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> is present, thus indicating that the black <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> are targeting the young howlers. When the brown howler monkey is threatened by terrestrial animals they will remain in the tree canopy and remain silent for 5-15 minutes.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} behavioural features of many forest primates are the loud calls given by the adult males. Early observational studies repeatedly postulated that these calls function in intragroup spacing or intergroup avoidance. More recent field experiments with Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) of Ta Forest, Ivory Coast, have clearly shown that loud male calls function as predator alarm calls because calls reliably (1) label different predator classes and (2) convey semantic information about the predator type present. Here, I test the alarm call hypothesis another primate, the Campbell’s monkey (C. campbelli). Like Diana monkeys, male Campbell’s monkeys produce conspicuous loud calls to crowned <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Playback experiments showed that monkeys responded to the predator category represented by the different playback stimuli, regardless of whether they consisted of (1) vocalisations of the actual predators (crowned <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> shrieks or leopard growls), (2) alarm calls to crowned <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> or leopards given by other male Campbell’s monkeys or (3) alarm calls to crowned <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> or leopards given by sympatric male Diana monkeys. These experiments provide further evidence that non-human primates have evolved the cognitive capacity to produce and respond to referential labels for external events...|$|R

40|$|The {{endangered}} Javan <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> Spizaetus bartelsi {{is threatened}} {{in part by}} the illegal pet trade. In 1993 the species was declared Indonesia's National Rare/Precious Animal, by former President Soeharto. Trade in the species and keeping it as a pet are illegal. We consolidated data about the species in trade, as observed at bird markets, with private owners, in zoological gardens (to date the species has not been bred in captivity and those in zoos are all wild-caught that were formerly in trade) and wildlife rescue centres, involving at least 68 birds. The average price for the species at bird markets was USD 40 (n = 5). The number observed at bird markets appears to have increased over time. Furthermore, prior to its declaration as a National Rare/Precious Animal it was not considered in trade to be different from other large eagles. There are indications that individuals have been illegally exported to other parts of Asia. In the early 1990 s no Javan <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> were kept in zoos but it became in demand in the mid 1990 s and now there are 11 in six zoos throughout Java. Law enforcement with respect to trade in eagles appears to be largely absent but nine Javan <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> have been brought to a wildlife rescue centre on Java. Overall, the data suggest there was an increase in trade in Javan <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles</b> after it was declared the National Rare/Precious Animal.
