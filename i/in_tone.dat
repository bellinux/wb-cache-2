5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker than others in the series, with the change <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> dividing commentators. Some found the setting and constant noise to be distracting. The writing and production, however, were praised, with the cast being commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept.|$|E

A third volume of his poems, {{published}} in 1833 and containing works from {{the period of the}} Uprising, was far more nationalist <b>in</b> <b>tone,</b> and won more recognition in his homeland. At the same time, he wrote several works featuring romantic themes, and beautiful scenery, such as W Szwajcarii (In Switzerland), Rozłączenie (Separation), Stokrótki (Daisies) and Chmury (Clouds).|$|E

5|$|Nocturne (1958) is {{the last}} of the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set words by a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem. All the songs have subtly {{different}} orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and critic}} Barbara Mujica {{comments}} that the book's English translator, Edith Grossman, fully captures the multiple levels of {{meaning of the}} text, as well as García Márquez's modulations <b>in</b> <b>tone.</b> García Márquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their English translations.|$|E

5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system {{different from that of}} traditional games of the genre, with emphasis on timing and more elaborate attacks. The game is whimsical <b>in</b> <b>tone,</b> with various in-game jokes and comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under {{pressure}} from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro {{was the first of}} three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Shūgorō Yamamoto (the others would be Red Beard and Dodeskaden). It is lighter <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.|$|E

5|$|Glover's pika (Ochotona gloveri) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Ochotonidae. It was first {{described}} in 1922, by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas. The summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous, grayish brown, or tea brown in colour. The winter pelage {{is similar to the}} summer pelage, but is lighter <b>in</b> <b>tone.</b> Endemic to China, it is found in high altitudes of northeastern Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to construct haypiles. It is rated as {{a species of}}least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature.

5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|Nick's older sister, Gabrielle, {{became a}} {{successful}} {{film and television}} actress. Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music. Recordings of Molly Drake's songs, which have come to light since her death, are remarkably similar <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> and outlook to the later work of her son. Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery; both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano {{at an early age}} and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder she kept in the family drawing room.|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change <b>in</b> <b>tone.</b> See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious <b>in</b> <b>tone,</b> such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides {{a good example of the}} various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E

The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that the}} music was good and keeping <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> with the game, others {{found it to be}} odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{difference}} <b>in</b> <b>tone</b> between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
