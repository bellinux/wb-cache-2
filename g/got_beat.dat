He also attended TNA's Lockdown fan interaction in Lowell, Massachusetts on April 12, 2008 and later appeared as a guest on the October 8, 2008 edition of Spin Cycle, TNA's online-exclusive show. On November 2, 2008, Gilbertti was released from his contract with TNA, with them citing budgetary cuts as the reason. On the May 26, 2011 edition of Impact Wrestling, Disco Inferno made an appearance on Mr. Anderson's Scorpion Sitdown interview segment, where he was asked by Anderson to bury Sting. He refused and <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> down by Anderson until Sting came to his aid.|$|E

500|$|The game {{restarted}} {{with two}} new goaltenders and the Senators {{on the power}} play, but within three seconds, the fighting started again — Ottawa's Chris Neil poked Radovan Somik with his stick, and the pair started scrapping. At the same time, Zdeno Chara started a fight with the Flyers' Mattias Timander, for which the former received an instigator penalty. Both fights angered Philadelphia Head Coach Ken Hitchcock, who claimed that, [...] "Their tough guy [...] <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> up and then their next two lines fought guys who don't fight." [...] Flyer General Manager Bob Clarke was also critical, saying, [...] "I understand Rob Ray fighting Donald Brashear. That's okay. [...] But don't go after guys who don't know how to defend themselves like Somik and Timander." [...] As Chara had been ejected from the game, his penalty was served by Martin Havlat, who had been placed there {{to protect him from}} any possible attempts at retribution. Chara's penalty meant that at the next restart, the teams were back to even strength, with four players each. Immediately after the ensuing face-off, Michal Handzus and Mike Fisher took part in the seventh fight of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Oregon's 52–21 {{defeat of}} Fresno State was Bellotti's 100th win {{as a coach}} at the University of Oregon. [...] Dennis Dixon threw for two {{touchdown}}s and ran for another. [...] Ducks running back Jonathan Stewart ran for 165 yards and scored two touchdowns, one touchdown being part of an 88-yard run. [...] Dixon said [...] "The sky's the limit right now. This offense is really clicking." [...] Although Dixon didn't put up numbers as impressive as he did at Michigan the previous week, he had a solid performance, completing 14 for 20 passes for 139 yards and running for 59 yards. [...] Oregon's mascot was suspended and watched the game, but not from the sidelines. [...] Fresno State's quarterback Tom Brandstater completed 18–32 passes for 219 yards and one touchdown. [...] The loss was Fresno State's second against a ranked team on the road. [...] The previous week the Bulldogs lost 47–45 to Texas A in triple overtime. [...] Fresno State coach Pat Hill said [...] "ow many times do I have to say it? We got dominated in all three phases. We <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> pretty good today. That doesn't happen at Fresno State very often. Today we <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> by a better football team. [...] They took it to us. End of conversation." ...|$|E

He {{spent his}} childhood years {{with his sister}} Linda, living and working at the former College Courts, an efficiency apartment complex owned by his father, T. J. Davis, located {{at the intersection of}} College Avenue and 5th Street. Davis describes his father, who was divorced from Davis' mother, as [...] "very religious, very strict, and very stubborn". Though Davis was physically small, he had a penchant for getting into fistfights. [...] "In those days, it was all about football, rodeo, and fistfights. Oh, man, I <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> up so much while I was growing up in Lubbock," [...] Davis said in a March 2, 2008, interview with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal newspaper. [...] "I was 5 feet, 9 inches, and weighed 125 pounds. I joined Golden Gloves, but didn't do good even in my (own) division." [...] After he finished high school, Davis moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where his mother lived, to get out of Lubbock.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1983 US Open, Evert {{made it to}} {{the finals}} to play nemesis Navratilova, which this was the first-time {{encounter}} for both in a US Open final. [...] In the first set, Evert <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> by Navratilova by a score of six games to one. [...] The second set saw breaks of serve being exchanged {{at the start of the}} set, which Evert got her serve broke in the first game of the set and was down quickly down love-two. [...] But, Evert would fight back to win the next three games breaking Navratilova's serve in the fourth game to take a marginal lead of three games to two, which in the seventh game broke Evert's serve to take a four games to three lead. [...] In the ninth game, Evert was down love-40 points, which because of three Navratilova mistakes on her backhand wing. [...] This let Evert get the game back to deuce, but Evert lost it when a lob went long to give Navratilova a match point and when a backhand sailed over the line the match was finished.|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>beat</b> fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will add}} this: {{that if there}} be any man who {{does not believe that}} slavery is wrong in the three aspects which I have mentioned, or in any one of them, that man is misplaced, and ought to leave us; while on the other hand, if there be any man in the Republican party who is {{impatient}} over the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it, and would act in disregard of these, he too is misplaced, standing with us. He will find his place somewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are capable of understanding them, for all these things. This, gentlemen, as well as I can give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity. I will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me,--a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong. That policy is the Democratic policy, and that sentiment is the Democratic sentiment. If there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the Democratic party in relation to this subject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few things tending, as I think, to prove that proposition. In the first place, the leading man--I think I may do my friend Judge Douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the present Democratic policy never himself says it is wrong. He has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never having said slavery is either right or wrong. Almost everybody else says one or the other, but the Judge never does. If there be a man in the Democratic party who thinks it is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him, in the first place, that his leader don't talk as he does, for he never says that it is wrong. In the second place, I suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes {{the idea that there is}} anything wrong in it. If you will examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery. Perhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am will tell me that I am wrong about this. I wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little. You say it is wrong; but don't you constantly object to anybody else saying so? Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it? You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the slave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics, because that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit, because it is not religion. Then where is the place to oppose it? There is no suitable place to oppose it. There is no place in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is coming. Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in Missouri, had an election in August, and <b>got</b> <b>beat,</b> and you, Mr. Democrat, threw up your hat, and hallooed [...] "Hurrah for Democracy!" [...] So I say, again, that in regard to the arguments that are made, when Judge Douglas Says he [...] "don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down," [...] whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment, or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy, it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in it; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong. He cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down. When Judge Douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is nothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong. When he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the Territories, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning truly, if there is no difference between them as property; but if the one is property held rightfully, and the other is wrong, then there is no equality between the right and wrong; so that, turn it in anyway you can, in all the arguments sustaining the Democratic policy, and in that policy itself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery. Let us understand this. I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are right, and they are wrong. I have been stating where we and they stand, and trying to show what is the real difference between us; and I now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated, can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong,--then, and not till then, I think we will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation.|$|E
