Perez's father, Serafin Perez, taught him how to sing the traditional décimas and to carve decoy ducks. Perez's carvings were used in hunting, as well as art. Serafin Perez lost his home, as well as eighty decoys, when Hurricane Betsy devastated Louisiana in 1965.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 2012, Gillani {{chaired the}} second energy conference held in Lahore. As {{part of the}} federal government's energy {{conservation}} plan, Gillani had ordered that air-conditioners of the Prime Minister House and Prime Minister's Secretariat could not be switched on before 11am. According to the government sources, Gillani's government has levelled up the nuclear energy programme up ~ 78% for two combined 664 MW commercial nuclear plants, C-3 and C-4 at Chashma Nuclear Power Complex to be completed at their record time. The ground work on Karachi Nuclear Power Complex was also laid in 2012 as part of <b>his</b> <b>nuclear</b> policy. Amid public rage and media pressure, the Gillani government also intensified its ground work on the Thar coal electric project that could develop another source of cheap electricity generation, despite the strong opposition by the planning commission.|$|E
25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire <b>his</b> <b>nuclear</b> missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E

25|$|Sharif {{took steps}} for intense {{government}} control {{of science in}} Pakistan and the projects needed his authorisation. In 1991, Sharif founded and authorised the Pakistan Antarctic Programme under the scientific directions of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), with the Pakistan Navy's Weapons Engineering Division, and first established the Jinnah Antarctic Station and the Polar Research Cell. In 1992, Pakistan became an Associate Member of Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research which was signed by his Science Adviser Munir Ahmed Khan at United Nations. As like Benazir, the ongoing nuclear weapons and the energy program remained {{one of his top}} priority. Sharif countered the international pressure, and followed the same suit as Benazir's, and refused to make compromise to halt the program despite the United States having offered a large economic aid to Pakistan. Unlike Benazir, Sharif's nuclear policy was seen less aggressive towards India and focused the atomic programme for the benefit of public usage and civil society. Unlike Benazir's nuclear policy, his set forth nuclear policy was to build civil and peaceful nuclear power, and with that vision, Sharif intensively used the integrated atomic programme for medical and economic purposes. <b>His</b> <b>nuclear</b> policy was viewed by experts as vintage Atoms for Peace program— the United States' 1950s program to use the nuclear energy for civil purposes, and to promote peaceful nuclear technology in the world as well.|$|E

This motherly position was described by Michelle Erica Green in her review of the episode [...] "The Disease" [...] for TrekNation, who described certain scenes as Kim needing to request permission from [...] "Mommy" [...] {{in order to have a}} relationship with an alien.

He collaborated with Klaus Fuchs on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on [...] "Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate nuclear fusion. The Fuchs–von Neumann patent used radiation implosion, but not {{in the same way as}} is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the Teller–Ulam design. Their work was, however, incorporated into the [...] "George" [...] shot of Operation Greenhouse, which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design. The Fuchs–von Neumann work was passed on to the Soviet Union by Fuchs as part of <b>his</b> <b>nuclear</b> espionage, but it was not used in the Soviets' own, independent development of the Teller–Ulam design. The historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that ironically, [...] "John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made." ...|$|E

Everyone in town finally believes Homer, though Lisa maintains {{that there must be}} a logical explanation. Friday comes again and everyone goes to the forest. The alien appears, promising love, but the townspeople begin to riot, and charge at the alien. Lisa and Waylon Smithers stop them just in time, showing that the [...] "alien" [...] is actually Mr. Burns. Smithers explains that Burns receives longevity treatment once a week in order to cheat death; this leaves him disoriented, as well as giving him a soft, high pitched voice {{as a result of a}} vocal cord scraping. Back to his normal self, Burns reveals that his green glow is due to many years of working in <b>his</b> <b>nuclear</b> plant, before receiving another booster injection from Dr. Nick.

In return Ahmadinejad fought back that Rafsanjani failed to differentiate privatization with the corrupt takeover of government-owned companies and of foreign policies which led to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996.
