25|$|The enthusiasm, however, {{proved to}} be short lived. Auckland's {{successor}} as Governor General, Lord Ellenborough, appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and {{for the duration of}} his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, Lord Hardinge, was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse, had seemingly affected Cautely's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in Great Britain and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the North-Western Provinces, with James Thomason as Lt. Governor, and in British India with Lord Dalhousie as Governor-General. Canal construction, under Cautley's supervision, now went into full swing. A 350-mile long canal, with another 300 miles of branch lines, eventually stretched between the <b>headworks</b> in Hardwar and—after splitting into two branches at Nanau near Aligarh—the confluence with the Ganges at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) and with the Jumna (now Yamuna) mainstem at Etawah. The Ganges Canal, which required a total capital outlay of £2.15 million, was officially opened in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie. According to historian Ian Stone: It was the largest canal ever attempted in the world, five times greater in its length than all the main irrigation lines of Lombardy and Egypt put together, and longer by a third than even the largest USA navigation canal, the Pennsylvania Canal.|$|E

On August 9, the entire flow of the Colorado swerved into the canal and began to flood the bottom of the Imperial Valley. In a desperate gamble to close the breach, crews of the Southern Pacific Railroad, whose tracks ran through the valley, attempted to dam the Colorado above the canal, only to see their work demolished by a flash flood. It took seven attempts, more than $3million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the federal government to permanently block the breach and send the Colorado on its natural course to the gulf – but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a [...] lake, today's Salton Sea.

40|$|Introduction The use of patient-reported outcome {{measures}} (PROM) enables to capture some {{facets of the}} lived experience of disease {{that would not be}} identified by disease severity measures only. Generic disability PROMs enable to get an broad description of the impact of a group of disease, e. g. neurological ones, but they do not capture disease-specific issues. To get to this, disease-specific disability measures are needed, and they can be developed using the ICF. Here we describe the stages of development of three different ICF-based PROMS: a measure of disability specific for Myasthenia Gravis (the MG-DIS), and two measures of work-related problems in Multiple Sclerosis (MSQ-Job) and in headache disorders (<b>HeadWork).</b> Methods Items are developed on the basis of: ICF-based description of disability for specific diseases; a literature review; qualitative patients’ report. Selected themes are then converted into items to be tested with specific research protocols, whose aims are to address the factor structure, deleting non-essential items, and test the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Results The MSQ-Job is composed of 42 items and is already published [1]; the items of the MG-DIS have been identified [2], and the questionnaire is in course of validation; the <b>HeadWork</b> is at the stage of items development. Discussion ICF-based disability evaluations enable to understand how much of patients’ difficulties are due to their disease, and how much to hindering contextual factors...|$|R
