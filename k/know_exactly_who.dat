500|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> everybody is {{and where they are}} and what they're doing and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like {{they did not have to}} second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E

500|$|The crew {{originally}} {{wanted to}} shoot the entire pilot in Miami, but {{during the first two}} weeks of filming, three hurricanes went by: Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Since further filming was to take place during the hurricane season, and it was not possible to get insurance, the crew was forced to move to elsewhere. Though the state of Florida offered a US$450,000 subsidy, the Dexter crew relocated to Los Angeles. Executive producer Sara Colleton explained that the filming crew tried to create a different version of Miami in Los Angeles, that differed from the [...] "glossy look" [...] Miami has in [...] and Miami Vice. [...] "Dexter" [...] was shot in HD; cinematographer Romeo Tirone said he experienced some difficulties because HD [...] "sees everything." [...] As opposed to Dexter's [...] "disturbing" [...] environment, Tirone tried to give Rita's home a [...] "warmer, safer, happier place" [...] with [...] "a dark side to it," [...] doing so by letting more light come through the windows. Editor Elena Maganini was contacted by episode director Michael Cuesta after he saw her previous work with director John McNaughton; Maganini had previously worked on a serial killer movie entitled [...] Michael Cuesta said that when he met Elena he [...] "...thought she had great instincts, was relaxed and didn’t pretend to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> this character was.

After descending the throne during the first song, [...] "Candy Shop", Madonna and her dancers are featured on a 1935 Auburn Speedster {{to the performance of}} the song. Both Williams and West appeared in the videos being displayed on the backdrops. Sarah Liss of CBC News called the performance [...] "pulsating," [...] noting that [...] "her studio collaborators—Pharrell Williams and Kanye West—present in spirit and countenance (their virtual likenesses grimaced from those massive screens) if not in body." [...] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the performance, writing that [...] "by the second song, 'Beat Goes On', it was clear {{that this was going to}} be one hell of an innovative show." [...] Roffman also pointed out that [...] "a digital Kanye West joined Madonna on stage, rapping along as the singer flipped and bounced on the floor." [...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> you are'." [...] The live performance of the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live CD-DVD album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E

Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended.

[...] This deeply upsets Bree, who tells him he has to change or {{he will not be}} with her in heaven; Andrew is shocked and agrees to meet the reverend. In his final scene of the season, after swearing the reverend to secrecy, Andrew states that, not only that he does not believe in God and lied to his parents about being gay {{to get out of the}} camp. This confuses the reverend, who asks him whether he is heterosexual or not: Andrew replies, [...] "Look, I love vanilla ice cream, okay? But every now and then I’m probably gonna be in the mood for chocolate." [...] He then says he will get revenge on Bree for rejecting him by pretending to be a model son and then doing something so awful it is [...] "going to really destroy her".|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October 1937 King George and Queen Elizabeth visited Halifax. This was a {{cause for}} much celebration {{throughout}} the town and surrounding areas and large crowds of well wishers arrived to see them. Richardson, {{was in charge of}} the Policing arrangements and he followed up his success of 1926 by producing another, this time larger, list of procedures. Many more surrounding Forces were involved, so great clarity and understanding was required by the men. In the booklet he produced instructions for everyone involved in the procession of the King and Queen through the town. Every item that could have affected the procession is contained in the next 28 pages. Street closures-Funeral processions-crowd control-possible crowd surges-erecting barriers and taking them down-Police Signal lights-street telephones boxes-Police deportment-do not salute- Rights of photographers, First Aid, and the Mounted Police had a special extra set of instructions. [...] It is possible to read through the booklet and <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> was where doing what by time and location within minutes. Each book had a unique number which the involved policeman signed for, and at the back is a message to say each copy MUST be returned to the Chief Constable of Halifax at the end of the day. Reading the booklet headings it appears the Royals safety was being taken more seriously perhaps than before. A photograph was taken and published in the Halifax Guardian showing the King and Queen with Chief Constable Richardson, the Mayor and other local Dignitaries.|$|E

60|$|Cards! cards! The {{table was}} cleared. Villona {{returned}} quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank {{the health of}} the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very high and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> was winning but {{he knew that he was}} losing. But it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his I.O.U.'s for him. They were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht The Belle of Newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Next day {{we spent}} in {{preparations}} for departure. Mine consisted chiefly in superintending the digging {{up of the}} stockade of ivory tusks, which I did with the greatest satisfaction. There were some five hundred of them altogether. I made inquiries about it from Every, {{who told me that}} the stockade had been there so long that nobody seemed to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> had collected the tusks originally. There was, however, a kind of superstitious feeling about them which had always prevented the chiefs from trying to sell this great mass of ivory. Every and I examined it carefully, and found that although it was so old its quality was really as good as ever, and there was very little soft ivory in the lot. At first I was rather afraid lest, now that my services had been rendered, Nala should hesitate to part with so much valuable property, but this was not the case. When I spoke to him on the subject he merely said, 'Take it, Macumazahn, take it; you have earned it well,' and, to speak the truth, though I say it who shouldn't, I think I had. So we pressed several hundred Matuku bearers into our service, and next day marched off with the lot.|$|E
5000|$|The big {{collection}} {{issue was}} the 20%/100% split, people in employment {{had to pay}} 100%, students and the registered unemployed paid 20%.

60|$|He {{looked out}} between whiles at the {{pleasant}} English land, an April AQUARELLE washed in with wondrous breadth. He knew the French thing, {{he knew the}} American, but he had known nothing of this. He saw it already as the remarkable Miss Wenham's setting. The doctor's daughter at Flickerbridge, with nippers on her nose, a palette on her thumb and innocence in her heart, had been the miraculous link. She had become aware even there, in our world of wonders, that the current fashion for young women so equipped was to enter the Parisian lists. Addie had accordingly chanced upon her, {{on the slopes of}} Montparnasse, as one of the English girls in one of the thorough-going sets. They had met in some easy collocation and had fallen upon common ground; after which the young woman, restored to Flickerbridge for an interlude and retailing there her adventures and impressions, had mentioned to Miss Wenham, who had known and protected her from babyhood, that that lady's own name of Adelaide was, as well as the surname conjoined with it, borne, to her knowledge, in Paris, by an extraordinary American specimen. She had then recrossed the Channel with a wonderful message, a courteous challenge, to her friend's duplicate, who had in turn granted through her every satisfaction. The duplicate had in other words bravely let Miss Wenham <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>who</b> she was. Miss Wenham, in whose personal tradition the flame of resentment appeared to have been reduced by time to the palest ashes--for whom indeed the story of the great schism was now but a legend only needing a little less dimness to make it romantic--Miss Wenham had promptly responded by a letter fragrant with the hope that old threads might be taken up. It was a relationship that they must puzzle out together, and she had earnestly sounded the other party to it on the subject of a possible visit. Addie had met her with a definite promise; she would come soon, she would come when free, she would come in July; but meanwhile she sent her deputy. Frank asked himself by what name she had described, by what character introduced him to Flickerbridge. He mainly felt on the whole as if he were going there to find out if he were engaged to her. He was at sea really now as to which of the various views Addie herself took of it. To Miss Wenham she must definitely have taken one, and perhaps Miss Wenham would reveal it. This expectation was in fact his excuse for a possible indiscretion.|$|E
