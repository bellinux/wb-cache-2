40|$|Context & motivation] Growing {{software}} companies with increasing product complexity face {{the issue of}} how to scale up their Requirements Engineering (RE) practices. In market-driven requirements <b>engineering,</b> <b>release</b> planning and scoping decisions are increasingly challenging as the size and complexity increases. [Problem] This paper presents initial results of an on-going exploratory, qualitative investigation of three market-driven, industrial cases with the objective of increasing our understanding of challenges in scaling up requirements engineering and how these challenges are addressed by the studied companies. [Results] Through 13 interviews in three companies, requirements engineering scalability issues are explored related to scoping and the structure of RE artifacts. [Contribution] The main contribution are findings related to increasing RE scale based on interpretations of the experienced interviewees’ views...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{establishes a}} systematic program to establish, organize, and document the design basis and design requirement {{information for the}} K Basins where existing design information is inadequate. The Design Reconstitution Program involves identifying and retrieving design information from identified source documents; evaluating, verifying, and validating the design information; resolving discrepancies; regenerating missing critical design information; and preparing and issuing a summary document of the design information. Upon completion, the design requirements shall be evaluated with the facility as-found configuration to verify the adequacy of appropriate design requirements with the as-found configuration and to document and resolve any discovered discrepancies. Once the design requirement (design analysis, calculation, design basis) comparison is made and discrepancies resolved (dispositioned, implemented, and incorporated as required), the as-found condition of a drawing then becomes an as-built drawing that is released into the <b>engineering</b> <b>release</b> system. This as-built drawing is then the accurate accounting of the field configuration {{that is consistent with}} the design requirements (recovered through the design reconstitution program) and is used with high confidence to make valid engineering, operational, and maintenance decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{high level}} process {{consists}} of three major funnels and two key parts. The first funnel is “Discovery” in which the new strategic goals are communicated company wide at an all hands meeting. In this stage, the company starts identifying major opportunities available in the market, having as its outcome a prioritized project list. As an example, in the grocery market, different opportunities had been observed and RFID was selected as a potential opportunity in the prioritized projec list {{to use as a}} substitute for the traditional bar code. Based on our estimate it can create an emerging market worth 6 billion USD in 5 years. The second funnel is “Technology. ” It starts with identification of core competencies needed to transfer technology from laboratory to factory and will end with a technology transfer plan which contains how to close the gap between what is required and what Paru currently has in-house. The third funnel is “New Product Implementation. ” It is a hybrid process which will go for simultaneous product and process concept development. These processes are carried out with proactive integration and collaboration so by the time the <b>engineering</b> <b>release</b> is approved, everything is in place to go into large-volume manufacturing without any further delays. Paru will go through the above mentioned steps to produce and sell RFID tags. After the three major funnels, the next stage of the process is volume production. This stage does not only includes manufacturing but also all the activities for continuous improvement that result to solve problems identify during volume production as well as those activities to optimize costs, quality, and yield until a second generation product is released or a product goes into obsolescence. The following sections describe the details of each part of the development process; all diagrams are included in the appendix of this report...|$|E

50|$|<b>Release</b> <b>engineering,</b> {{frequently}} abbreviated as RE {{or as the}} clipped compound Releng, is a sub-discipline {{in software}} engineering concerned with the compilation, assembly, and delivery of source code into finished products or other software components. Associated with the software release life cycle, it was said by Boris Debic of Google Inc. that <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> is to software engineering as manufacturing is to an industrial process: <b>Release</b> <b>engineering</b> {{is the difference between}} manufacturing software in small teams or startups and manufacturing software in an industrial way that is repeatable, gives predictable results,and scales well. These industrial style practices not only contribute to the growth of a company but also arekey factors in enabling growth.The importance of <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> in enabling growth of a technology company has been repeatedly argued by John O'Duinn and Bram Adams. While it is not the goal of <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> to encumber software development with a process overlay, it is often seen as a sign of organizational and developmental maturity.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{large and}} complex {{solutions}} {{are needed to}} provide the services that users require, where cloud-based solutions have been the panacea to help solve this problem. However, these solutions, are complex {{in the nature of}} their implementation, and the need for a standardized way of handling the services are in order. This thesis aims to explore the possibilities of simplifying <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> processes, with the usage of multi-stacked container-based services. A model is designed with the goal of reducing the complexity in <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> processes. It enables restriction of possible outcomes by enabling constraints to specify the wanted state of an environment, and enforces a single method approach towards achieving a more uniform environment. The model has been implemented in a prototype, which enables the documentation, configuration and orchestration of the deployed services, that are deployed with the usage of Docker containers. Through the implementation, the validity of the designed model is verified, and the complexity of the <b>release</b> <b>engineering</b> processes are reduced...|$|R
