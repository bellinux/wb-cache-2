50|$|Built with juniper logs {{upright in}} the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep {{purchased}} from Navajo stockmen by Mr. Hubbell. The flocks {{stayed in the}} corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time Mr. Hubbell kept beef cattle as well. Mr. Hubbell homesteaded 160 acre before {{they were part of}} the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress Mr. Hubbell got permission to keep his <b>home.</b> <b>Freight</b> wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, freight wagons hauled huge sacks of wool.|$|E
5000|$|The loss of one-seat {{commuter}} {{service to the}} Loop devastated the interurban. The railroad's financial condition was already shaky, and schemes to restore downtown service faced various legal or operational obstacles. As early as 1952, the railroad had sought to substitute buses for the trains, and after years of financial losses, in April 1957 the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized the railroad to discontinue passenger service. [...] Passenger groups and affected municipalities sought injunctions that forced the railroad to temporarily continue service, {{but as soon as}} court rulings cleared the way, management abruptly ended passenger service, at noon on July 3, 1957. Commuters who had ridden the CA&E into the city found themselves stranded when they returned to take the train <b>home.</b> <b>Freight</b> operations continued for two more years, until they too ended on June 10, 1959. No trains ran after this point, but the right-of-way and rolling stock were preserved in the event that a party stepped forward to purchase the property. The official abandonment of the Chicago, Aurora & Elgin came at 5:00pm on July 6, 1961, just over four years after the final passenger trains had run. The real estate became part of the Aurora Corporation of Illinois, a small conglomerate, which slowly sold off the right-of-way and other properties. Portions of the right-of-way are now operated as a multi-use trail called the Illinois Prairie Path.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly when hobos first {{appeared}} on the American railroading scene. With {{the end of the}} American Civil War in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning <b>home</b> began hopping <b>freight</b> trains. Others looking for work on the American frontier followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Mosier {{residents}} were evacuated and the {{sewage treatment plant}} was shut down. An oil sheen was seen on the Columbia River by the following morning. Two days after the crash {{residents were}} {{allowed to return to}} their <b>homes,</b> and <b>freight</b> trains were running on the tracks, to the strong objection of the community. The community then passed an emergency motion asking Union Pacific to remove all oil from the damaged cars before resuming use of the tracks. Union Pacific pushed the damaged cars {{out of the way and}} limited the train speed to 10 mph in the section.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{the local economy}} {{remained}} dominated by agriculture. From 1941 until 1965 it was <b>home</b> to a <b>freight</b> warehousing business.

25|$|On 14 June 1941, {{thousands}} of people were taken from their <b>homes,</b> loaded onto <b>freight</b> trains and taken to Siberia. Whole families, women, children and old people were sent to death camps in Siberia. The crime was perpetrated by the Soviet occupation regime on the orders of high authorities in Moscow. Prior the deportation, the Peoples Commissariat established operational groups who performed arrests, search and seizure of the property. Arrests took place in all parts in Latvia including rural areas.|$|R

50|$|Haileyville, in the Choctaw Nation, was {{a company}} town, {{which was a}} common feature of coal-mining communities. Italians, American Indians, Russians, and Americans {{comprised}} most of Haileyville, and many worked in the mines or on the railroads. Coal from the area was only profitable due to the railroad junction. The town was <b>home</b> to the <b>freight</b> and passenger offices of the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad, which later became the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company (Rock Island). By 1902 the railroad had 1,052 miles of track, including a branch from the town that ran to Ardmore. Haileyville remained the division point of the Rock Island Railroad until 1958, when the offices moved to El Reno.|$|R
