40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model is a {{fundamental}} part of what Europe stands for, but {{a very important issue}} to know is that this model is not only <b>European,</b> not wholly <b>social</b> and not a model. The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model is not limited to social policy in the narrow sense: welfare, healthcare, pensions, but it includes also employment policy such as labour market rules, equality policies, benefit rules.
