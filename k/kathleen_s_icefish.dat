40|$|Identifies the social-behavioral skills {{students}} need for successful mainstreaming.

Some of the {{characters}} required {{a great deal of}} prosthetics and makeup led by Steve Koch, Brian Sipe, and Mark Garbarino. Prosthetics did not quite add the height needed on certain shots for the character of Mr. Tall, played by Academy Award-nominated Ken Watanabe. Although Watanabe is six feet tall, a body double was cast for certain shots. Trevon Flores, a local basketball player who stands 6'10" [...] tall and weighs 210 pounds, was used for certain shots to show the abnormal height of Mr. Tall. Additionally, Watanabe utilized dialogue coaches <b>Kathleen</b> <b>S.</b> Dunn and Francie Brown in pre-production and production to further enhance his performance as the circus barker.

40|$|Several recent {{observations}} {{suggest a}} connection between Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, and the synucleinopathies. Rare patients have been observed who develop both Gaucher disease and parkinsonism. Autopsy studies on these subjects reveal synuclein-positive Lewy bodies and inclusions. An increased incidence of synucleinopathies also has been noted in relatives of Gaucher probands. In complementary studies, screening of patients with parkinsonism has identified a greater than expected frequency of glucocerebrosidase mutations. These glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers have {{a wide spectrum of}} associated parkinsonian phenotypes, ranging from classic L-dopa-responsive Parkinson disease to a phenotype more characteristic of Lewy body dementia. Despite this association, the vast majority of Gaucher carriers and patients with Gaucher disease never develop parkinsonism. However, mutations in this gene are likely to be a contributing risk factor in subjects otherwise prone to developing synucleinopathies. Copyright © 2006 <b>Kathleen</b> <b>S.</b> Hruska et al.

500|$|The {{justice of}} Bellingham's {{conviction}} was first questioned by Brougham, who condemned the trial as [...] "the greatest disgrace to English justice". In {{a study published}} in 2004 the American academic <b>Kathleen</b> <b>S.</b> Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act, when passions were running high. She also draws attention to the court's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses. There was, she [...] maintains, insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham's sanity, and Mansfield's summing-up showed significant bias. Bellingham's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court; Linklater's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests—perhaps Liverpool merchants, who bore the main brunt of Perceval's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise. Comments by a Liverpool newspaper, says Linklater, indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city. It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination, when he was not apparently engaged in any business. This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians; the columnist Bruce Anderson points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it.|$|R
