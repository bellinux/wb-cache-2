50|$|Around {{the end of}} the 16th century, the {{relations}} between the Commonwealth and the Ottomans, never too cordial, further worsened with the growing number of independent actions by Cossacks. From {{the second part of the}} 16th century, Cossacks started raiding the territories under Ottoman rule. The Commonwealth could not control the fiercely independent Cossacks, but was held responsible for them, since at that time they were nominally under the Commonwealth rule. At the same time, Tatars living under the Ottoman rule were raiding the Commonwealth. However, they attacked mostly in the south-eastern areas of the Commonwealth, which were fairly sparsely inhabited, while the Cossacks were raiding the heart of Ottoman Empire, wealthy merchant port cities just two days away from the mouth of the Dniepr river (which the Cossacks used as their main transportation route). By 1615, Cossacks had even burned the townships on the outskirts of Constantinople. Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Commonwealth called both parties to curb Cossack and Tatar activities, but they were never implemented on either side of the border. In <b>internal</b> <b>agreements,</b> pushed forward by the Polish side, the Cossacks agreed to burn their boats and stop their raiding. However, Cossack boats could be built quickly, and the Cossack lifestyle required periodic hunts for glory and booty. Sometimes Cossacks just needed resources to ensure their subsistence, while on other occasions they were bribed by the Habsburgs to help ease Ottoman pressure on their borders. Also, there was widespread animosity between Cossacks and Tatars, after decades of border clashes and reciprocal looting of estates and villages. Cossacks raided Ottomans territories and their vassals near the Black Sea almost yearly, usually attracting retaliatory Tatar raids (and vice versa). The vicious circle of chaos and retaliations often turned the entire south-eastern Commonwealth border into a low-level warzone.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedToday, political scientists working with international organizations seek to resolve internal conflicts in Bosnia- Herzegovina, Cyprus, and Kashmir. To solve such crises, political scientists have mostly tried to apply domestic comparative politics approaches. These techniques emphasize <b>agreements</b> among <b>internal</b> actors {{and have not}} been successful in most cases. In {{the case of the}} Transdniestrian conflict in the Republic of Moldova, mediators have found it difficult to achieve <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> because external factors also have played a significant role during the conflict. Therefore, even if an <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> is achieved, it will remain fragile due to the vulnerable geographic location of the Republic of Moldova and to the limited state capacity to counter influential external actors. For the purpose of solving the Transdniestrian conflict in the long run, this thesis analyzes the possibilities of creating regional complex interdependence around the Republic of Moldova, which would strengthen an <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> to resolve the conflict. Regional complex interdependence inter-connects the countries interested in the region around the Republic of Moldova: Romania, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. This solution presumes external and internal interconnections based on the complex interdependence theory of neo-liberalism. The main potential drawback is that any asymmetrical dependencies in the initial stage of cooperation will imbalance the proposed complex interdependence causing unilateral dependence (most likely on Russia) leading other actors to take countermeasures. In fact, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a neutral party has been being a legal umbrella for mediation since all parties consider it an appropriate organization for the negotiations. Nevertheless, creating such an arrangement requires an initial role of the United States of America and the European Union to balance Russian influence until the region becomes interdependent. At that moment, the continuation of the Transdniestrian conflict will become irrelevant because the pre-conditions for conflict will be eliminated.

The most major finding is a series of parallels between the SCIRP and previous major Commissions and Immigration Acts, where none has been previously recognized. Like the 1907 - 1911 “Dillingham Commission”, both Commissions set out to seek a solution to what was widely seen as a downward trend for immigrant quality, and that both Commissions subsequently found themselves crafting policy that belied their <b>internal</b> <b>agreements.</b> And like the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the SCIRP set out to craft a new set of policies that would enable the U.

Furthermore, the ramifications of the fallout from the SCIRP’s recommendations on the IRCA is visible in the 21 st century context as part of a move away from policymaking as technocratic endeavor to policymaking as an ideological brawl.

Shifting populations and mass movement, results in a lack of sustainable infrastructure, social tension and consequent health challenges. In order to address these issues through the most efficient strategy it is vital to identify these problems at the “source” rather than “downstream. ” Firstly, terminology relating to displaced persons is extremely important, especially with terms commonly used interchangeably within the media: 	Refugee- Persons fleeing armed conflict or persecution. Refugees are protected in international law and must have their basic needs met by the country they are residing in. Refugees cannot be made to return to situations where their lives and freedom are under threat. 	Migrant- Persons choosing to move not because of direct persecution or death.

This MSC certified small-scale fishery is co-managed through Territorial User Rights. Members of the fishing cooperative, have exclusive access to individual fishing grounds within Ascension Bay. The fishery {{is based on the}} use of artificial shelters. These bottom devices provide refuges for lobsters, reduce predation mortality, and facilitate harvesting by free diving and the use of hand nets.

The lobsters moved away from areas exposed to higher freshwater inflow to areas less exposed to this inflow. In order to determine and contrast the distributional effects in the fishery with and without this extreme climatic event, cooperative log books were used to calculate revenues and quasi-profits for fishing cooperative members (by Gini Index) in eight consecutive fishing seasons (including the fishing season affected by the extreme rainfall). Additionally, fisher interviews were performed to determine how cooperative members dealt with this climatic challenge. Results indicate that the extreme rainfall event had a spatial effect on the distribution of revenues and quasi-profits throughout the fishing grounds.

40|$|Agreements and {{administration}} of a decedent's estate In this thesis, I shall discuss agreements entered into by parties to a decedent's estate on {{administration of the}} estate. These agreements (shareholders' agreements) may cause problems in either {{the relationships between the}} shareholders or their relationships with third parties outside the estate. My particular aim is to assess: (1) how the mutual rights and obligations are arranged once the shareholders have entered into a joint administration agreement, and (2) what effect a joint administration agreement has when one of the parties in a legal relationship comes from outside the estate. In addition to actual contracts, I shall discuss situations (agreement-like situations) where acts performed by the parties create new rights and obligations. One example of such a situation is ex post facto ratification (ratihabition). In addition to clarify the contents of the norms, I shall seek to systematize the set of norms concerning shareholders' agreements. Therefore, this study falls within the sphere of legal dogmatics. In this thesis, I shall particularly focus on the possible effects of the interaction between contractual parties on the legal relations between both the parties to the estate and between the contractual parties and third parties. In this respect, the subject extends to other areas of the Finnish contract doctrine, and the original subject of this study - joint administration agreements - becomes a research tool as well. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish to what extent the interaction between contractual parties (or joint actors) may create, alter or revoke rights and obligations in the same ways as specific declarations of intent. A particular point of my interest is the dynamic features of the Finnish contract doctrine. For this reason, the starting-point of my study is the hypothesis that a typical agreement on the administration of a decedent's estate and the legal relations created by the agreement forms a process. This hypothesis will be tested in this study. This study shows that the Finnish contract doctrine, which has largely been created for the purposes of bilateral legal acts related to the sale of movables, does not easily apply to the regulation of continuous contractual relationships such as those discussed in this study. Changes in long-term contractual relations occur only gradually and on a factual level. The status of the agreement which has originally defined the rights and obligations of the shareholders can change with the shareholders' acts (whether these are active or passive). The shareholder's acts may indicate that they no longer consider an original term of the agreement binding on them. As a result of the interaction between the shareholders, <b>internal</b> <b>agreements</b> (of a certain kind) may emerge during the contractual relationship, which will considerably alter the role of the original agreement setting out the norms for the relationships between the shareholders. Accordingly, the shareholders' contractual relationship is a non-static process. The shareholders' legal positions may also be affected after the conclusion of the contract by changes in the circumstances, in which case the doctrines on excess difficulty or force majeure apply, for instance. Furthermore, the processual nature of the contractual relationship is effected by several flexible norms (Section 36 of the Contracts Act; Chapter 24, Section 5 of the Code of Inheritance; and the principle of fidelity). It can therefore be said that the importance of the declarations of intent (and events at the time of these declarations) underlying the shareholders' rights and obligations and creating contractual relations declines as the interaction between shareholders increases and circumstances change. The shareholders' legal positions with regard to an undistributed estate are thus determined on the basis of a very broad range of material. In some cases, such material implies an agreement or authorization between the shareholders (or between the estate and third parties). Occasionally, such agreements or authorizations imply an ex post facto ratification (ratihabition). In some rare cases, the shareholders or the decedent's estate have, under certain facts and circumstances, incurred an obligation under Chapter 18, Section 3 of the Code of Commerce to pay compensation for the benefit gained. Considering that an obligation incurred by a decedent's estate or the shareholders of a decedent's estate may often be based on other facts in law than a specific agreement, we could, similarly to Kurt Grönfors, call this a case of facts giving rise to an obligation. Facts giving rise to an obligation often affect contractual relationships even where they do not lead to an actual contract. Ratihabition, for instance, is often evidenced by the parties' actions rather than their specific declarations of intent. A commitment (of which entering a contract is also an example) may be a process which consists of a continuum of facts in law. Sometimes (although rarely) an obligation may emerge even without the principal being aware of a party's lack of authority to perform an act (Chapter 18, Section 3 of the Code of Commerce). If the principal is aware of an unauthorized act but does not respond to it in any way, this may imply that the act has their ex post facto ratification. An active act performed by a party may directly create an agreement or a comparable state of affairs. We could therefore see a commitment as a process and speak of facts establishing an obligation. Examining whether acts performed by shareholders have created an agreement requires considering the type of the agreement. For instance, the facts and circumstances referring to leaving an estate undistributed (joint administration agreement) can reasonably be expected to manifest a clear intention of a commitment. Leaving an estate undistributed is usually a very significant legal act for the shareholders as it deprives them of an opportunity to place the estate under an administrator or have the estate distributed during the life of the agreement. The situation is different if there is already undeniably a joint administration agreement between the shareholders and the problem is whether the shareholders can be considered to have altered their contractual relationship through an internal agreement. The legal situation created by a joint distribution agreement (and sometimes administration under Chapter 18 of the Code of Inheritance) must often be given a specific meaning. A successful determination of a rational meaning which corresponds best to the shareholders' intentions usually requires a low threshold for agreements. In practice, this specifically means that other acts of the shareholders than actual declarations of intent may gain significance easier when <b>internal</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered. This will also emphasize the processual nature of the contractual relationship between the shareholders. An ex post facto ratification of a legal act constitutes a recognition of the binding nature of that act. Unlike a contract, such a ratification is not future-oriented; it does not imply that any other future acts of the other party will be accepted as well. Consequently, the emergence of a ratification is based on lighter facts and circumstances than an agreement. The same applies for authorization. Because the authorizing party always has the option of revoking the authorization, an authorization is less restrictive on a principal's freedom of action than a contract. Paying compensation for benefit gained is the least compelling of the above obligations. It may have all the constituent elements of an obligation even if the act performed by the party showed no intention of a commitment. After all, in the case of compensation for benefit, principals' are bound by other parties' legal acts only to the extent of the benefit they may gain from it. If that benefit is less than the commitment, the obligation is limited to the amount of the benefit, or the amount of the enrichment. Whether any of the constituent elements referred to by the legal institutions mentioned above exist cannot be determined on the basis of a single legal act. Examination of social contractual relationships such as decedent's estates requires a more than atomistic approach. If the contract as a whole and the operating environment are taken into account in the legal acts performed by the parties in their contractual relationships, exclusion of such aspects when judicial decisions are being made will easily lead to an outcome which the parties have not anticipated at all, and the contract(s) will have failed to provide and ensure the stability and predictability expected from it. This study shows that, for the dynamics of the relationship between the contracting parties, the processual nature of a contractual relationship has more weight than that of an agreement (if the actual agreement is defined as a set of facts that consist of declarations of intent creating certain rights and obligations; in other words, defined as a legal act). Because of the above legal institutions, the shareholders' right and obligations cannot be considered static. This is illustrated by the main claim of my thesis: joint administration should not examined in the light of the norms of the Code of Inheritance and the principle of joint administration alone. As joint administration continues and cooperation increases, the rules of contract law gain more weight in joint administration. To this day, joint administration has been rather too narrowly considered a problem in the application of the Code of Inheritance, particularly Chapter 18, Section 2, which concerns the principle of joint administration. The following remark on joint administration agreements is also related to the main claim of my thesis: While the time when the declarations of intent which establish the original contractual relationship (non-distribution agreement) are made still remains the key moment for determining the shareholders' rights and obligations, the significance of that moment for shareholders' agreements is lower than usual; in this case, applying the time of the declarations of intent as the main systemic rule for determining the moment when legal consequences begin is clearly a weaker rule than in the case of a sale of movables, for instance. With regard to shareholders' agreements (and other long-term agreements), judicial decisions should be made in a manner which involves the option of departing from the main rule referred to above if it is evident from the parties' actions that they had not intended to fix their mutual rights and obligations to that specific time. Antti Kolehmainen käsittelee väitöskirjassaan kuolinpesien osakashallinnon synnyttämiä ongelmia. Osakashallinnossa pesän osakkaat voivat täydentää jäämistöoikeudellista sääntelyä keskinäisillä sopimuksilla. Tällöin osakkaille voi kuitenkin jäädä epäselväksi, millaisia oikeuksia ja velvollisuuksia heillä on ja kuka saa tehdä päätöksiä pesän puolesta. Teos antaa vastauksia muun muassa näihin kysymyksiin. Jäämistöhallintoa koskevista sopimuksista aiheutuvat ongelmat eivät aina jää vain pesän sisäisiksi. Osakkaat voivat sopia, että vain joku heistä edustaa kuolinpesää tehtäessä sopimuksia ulkopuolisten kanssa. Näissä tilanteissa voi jäädä tulkinnanvaraiseksi, onko pesän puolesta toimineella osakkaalla lopulta ollut oikeus edustaa kuolinpesää ja saako hänen kanssaan asioinut ulkopuolinen suojaa muiden osakkaiden vaatimuksilta. Osakkaiden tekemät sopimukset saattavat aiheuttaa ongelmia esimerkiksi pesänselvittäjän ja pesänjakajan toimivallan kannalta. Tässä teoksessa käsitellään näitäkin kysymyksiä. Varsinaisten sopimusten lisäksi Kolehmainen tarkastelee työssään myös sopimuksen kaltaisia tilanteita, joissa osapuolten toiminta synnyttää oikeuksia ja velvollisuuksia. Antti Kolehmaisen tutkimuksessa tullaan siihen tulokseen, että tähän asti yhteishallinto on nähty liian ahtaasti perintökaaren ja etenkin ns. yhteishallintoperiaatetta ilmentävän PK 18 : 2 :n soveltamisongelmana. Osakashallintoa ei tule kuitenkaan tarkastella pelkästään perintökaaren normien ja yhteishallintoperiaatteen valossa. Osakashallinnon pitkittyessä ja osakkaiden keskinäisen yhteistoiminnan lisääntyessä myös velvoiteoikeudellisen säännöstön merkitys yhteishallinnon normittajana kasvaa. Kuolinpesän osakkaiden väliset suhteet ovat dynaamisia, heidän oikeutensa ja velvollisuutensa elävät yhteishallinnon aikana erilaisten velvoiteoikeudellisten oikeusinstituuttien johdosta. Tähän asti osakkaiden keskinäiset suhteet on ymmärretty turhan staattisina...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review of}} crustal {{movements}} within the Fenno-Scandia shield is given. Results from postglacial studies, projects for measuring active fault regions, and dynamic ocean loading experiments are presented. The 1979 Scandinavian Doppler Campaign Network is discussed. This network includes Doppler translocation baseline determination of future very long baseline interferometry baselines to be measured in Scandinavia. Intercomparison of earlier Doppler translocation measurements with a high precision terrestrial geodetic baseline in Scandinavia has yielded <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> of 6 cm over 887 km. This is a precision of better than 1 part in to the 7 th power...|$|R
500|$|But {{even after}} NASA reached <b>internal</b> <b>agreement,</b> {{it was far}} from smooth sailing. Kennedy's science advisor Jerome Wiesner, who had {{expressed}} his opposition to manned spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office, and had opposed the decision to land men on the Moon, hired Golovin, who had left NASA, to chair his own [...] "Space Vehicle Panel", ostensibly to monitor, but actually to second-guess NASA's decisions on the Saturn V launch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea, Seamans, and even Webb to defend themselves, delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11, 1962, and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as [...] "tentative".|$|R
50|$|By <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> 2 May 27, 1978, {{signed by}} the Council of the University,the School of Information Science was created, which was {{intended}} to develop academic and professional proposals {{in the areas of}} communication, advertising, journalism and marketing. The unit was then divided into the School of Advertising, Market aspects Faculty and the Faculty of Social Communication and Journalism, the latter responsible for the Program in Communication and Journalism. The Institute for the Promotion of Higher Education, ICFES by agreeing 183 August 4, 1984, granted license to operate the program of Social Communication and Journalism at the Central University Foundation and gave final approval by Resolution 1652 of 5 August 1987.|$|R
40|$|Magnitudes are {{presented}} in 10 bandpasses for 63 stars {{that can be used}} as standards in photometric observations of comets. The bandpasses are, in addition to those for three (UV, blue, and red) continuum points, those which measure C 2, C 3, CN, CO(+), H 2 O(+), OH, and NH emissions. After correction for extinction, the derived magnitudes were transformed to a zero point such that all filters showed magnitude 5. 88 for the star HD 3379. The <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> among the present observations and the agreement obtained between the observations and independently published measures indicate that the derived magnitudes are generally accurate to + or - 0. 01 mag...|$|R
40|$|The syntax of noun {{phrases and}} their {{internal}} structure {{has been much}} discussed in the literature. In this paper I review a feature-based (HPSG) analysis proposed for German noun phrases, and examine to what extent this analysis can be extended to capture the corresponding Danish data. The analysis focusses on the internal structure of the Danish noun phrase, especially the various kinds of phrase <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> found in the prenominal and nominal domain, and the constraints governing adjunction of prenominal adjectives. In the conclusion I review the merits and problems of the proposed analysis, and argue that the Danish data overall supports the original analysis developed for German...|$|R
