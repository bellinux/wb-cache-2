She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, {{working from}} the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began {{to break through the}} back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, {{returning}} to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him [...] "is the missus in?" [...] The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.|$|E
2500|$|On {{appearing}} in HDYSAPLM? Mulholland said, [...] "It was very, very tough. My goal {{from the beginning}} had been {{to make it to}} the final and then let the public decide. So when I got voted out, I was absolutely devastated. I was so close and <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> final hurdle! It was a big shock to the system." [...] Andrew Lloyd Webber has since admitted that he made a mistake in sending her home too early from the BBC show, and is now immensely proud of the singer and her performances at the London Palladium as Maria; Lloyd Webber announced her recruitment saying her audition was [...] "sensational." ...|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{where the}} mail carrier Pechkin <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, and Galchonok answers [...] "Who's there?", {{is very similar}} to a similar episode in the American {{educational}} cartoon serial [...] "The Electric Company" [...] (1971) where <b>the</b> plumber <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door and is answered by a parrot.|$|R
60|$|Three days afterward, {{there came}} a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door--there had been other <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door before this, of course; but I am dealing merely {{with the history of}} the clock. The girl said a couple of men were outside, and wanted to see me, and I went to them.|$|R

2500|$|Marx's {{family was}} Jewish. Groucho's mother was Miene [...] "Minnie" [...] Schoenberg, whose family came from Dornum in {{northern}} Germany {{when she was}} 16 years old. His father was Simon [...] "Sam" [...] Marx, who changed his name from Marrix, and was called [...] "Frenchie" [...] by his sons throughout his life because {{he and his family}} came from Alsace in France. Minnie's brother was Al Schoenberg, who shortened his name to Al Shean when he went into show business as half of Gallagher and Shean, a noted vaudeville act of the early 20th century. According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the sources}} {{consulted}} clarifies why Cortina left the regional jefatura. At the time Carlism was divided into supporters of de Mella and those standing by the claimant, but in historiography he is only marginally mentioned as a somewhat disoriented Mellista sympathizer. It seems that the circumstances were strictly personal. Third Carlist War broke {{the back of the}} family; while other Marchena representatives of [...] "burguesia agraria" [...] kept growing into wealth, Cortina struggled. Turning 60 and with health problems, he concluded that he would be better off on the state payroll possibly earning a pension and perhaps assumed that moving to Madrid would facilitate his return to public service. Starting 1917 he was already noted as resident of the capital. As Ministerio de Ultramar no longer existed he <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doors of Ministerio de Hacienda and got finally restored as 3. class administrative official in Ministerio de Fomento, success probably conditioned by distant family ties.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the second day, 10 December 1878, leaving Byrne in charge of the hostages, the other three started out to work. First they cut the telegraph wires, chopping the posts down to make sure, and were careful to destroy more wire than an ordinary repairer would carry with him. Three or four railway men endeavoured to interfere, but they too joined the other hostages in Younghusband's storeroom. Carrying a cheque drawn by McCauley on the National Bank for a few pounds, the three bushrangers, all heavily armed, went to the bank. (Kenneally relates that Hart who approached from the back ran into the bank's housemaid, Maggie Shaw, with whom he had been at school in Wangaratta.) In the meantime Byrne had unlawfully kidnapped a telegraph-line repairer, who had begun to make trouble. The others reached the bank after closing time, travelling in the hawker's cart. Kelly <b>knocked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door and forced the clerk to open and cash the cheque he had. They held up the unwise clerk and his manager, a Mr Scott. The robbers took £700 in notes, gold, and silver. Ned Kelly insisted to the manager that there was more money there, and eventually forced him to open the safe, from which the outlaws got £1,500 in paper, £300 in gold, about £300 worth of gold dust and nearly £100 worth of silver. The reported total amount stolen was 68 £10 notes, 67 £5 notes, 418 £1 notes, £500 in sovereigns, about £90 in silver; and a 30oz ingot of gold. The outlaws were polite and considerate to Scott's wife. Scott himself invited the outlaws to drink whisky with him, which they did. The whole party went to Younghusband's where the rest of the hostages were. The evening seems to have passed quite pleasantly. McCauley remarked to Kelly that the police might come along, which would mean a fight. Kelly replied, [...] "I wish they would, for there is plenty of cover here." [...] In the evening, tea was prepared, and at half-past 8, the outlaws warned the hostages not to move for three hours, informing them that they were going. Just before they left, Kelly noticed that a Mr. McDougall was wearing a watch, and asked for it. McDougall replied that it was a gift from his dead mother. Kelly declared that he wouldn't take it under any consideration, and very soon afterwards the four of the outlaws left. What is unusual is that these stirring events happened without the people in the town knowing of anything. The hostages left the station after five hours.|$|E
