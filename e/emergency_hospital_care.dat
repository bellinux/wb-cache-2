50|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} concerning the safety of home births for both {{the child and the}} mother. Standard practices, licensing requirements and access to <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> differ between regions making it difficult to compare studies across national borders. A 2014 US survey of medical studies found that perinatal mortality rates were triple that of hospital births, and a US nationwide study over 13 million births on a 3-year span (2007-2010) found that births at home were roughly 10 times as likely to be stillborn (14 times in first-born babies) and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals, while a 2007 UK survey found that perinatal mortality rates were only slightly higher in that country than planned hospital births for low-risk pregnancies. Both baby's and mother's higher mortalities are associated with the inability to offer timely assistance to mothers with emergency procedures in case of complications during labour, as well as with widely varying licensing and training standards for birth attendants between different states and countries.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedObjective: To {{evaluate}} potential {{measures of}} quality-of-care in asthma as predictors ofsubsequent <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> under skewed class and cost distributions.; Methods: The California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) claims data from January 2004 to December 2006 was analyzed. Patients with persistent asthma were identified using the Health Employers Data Information Set (HEDIS) criteria and were stratified into high (≥ 6 reliever medication claims) and low-reliever (= 0. 5 {{was the best}} predictor of asthma related <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> as it had the greatest AUC in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies; however, the predictive power was modest (< 0. 6 in all analyses). The predictive performance of the baseline covariates was significantly higher, with the AUC ranging between 0. 7 and 0. 8. No asthma performance measure improved the AUC when added to the baseline covariates. Application of the ROC convex hull method suggests that these models are better than the “do nothing” strategy only when the cost of false negatives exceeds the cost of false positives. Similarly, application of decision curve analysis yields the greatest net benefit at low probability thresholds, implying the greatest utility occurs when the cost of a false negative exceeds the cost of a false positive. The low incidence of emergency hospital in each quarter of the longitudinal study yields a minimum cost classifier with only marginally better performance than the strategy of “assume all are patients are negative”.; Conclusion: Two potential quality-of-care measures, the asthma medication ratio andproportion days’ covered, appear to be superior to the current HEDIS performance measure of any controller dispensing. However, prediction models that incorporate demographics and prior resource use data have significantly better ability to identify patients at high-risk for asthma-related <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> than the asthma quality-of-care measures alone. The low incidence of <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> suggests that identifying high-risk patients based on accuracy alone may result in suboptimal outcomes.

40|$|Nearly all Dutch {{citizens}} {{have a general}} practitioner (GP), acting as a gatekeeper to secondary care. Some patients bypass the GP and present to the emergency department (ED). To make best use of existing emergency care, Dutch health policy makers and insurance companies have proposed the integration of EDs and GP cooperatives (GPCs) into one facility. In this study, we examined ED use and assessed the characteristics of self-referrals and non-self-referrals, their need for <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> and self-referrals' motives for presenting at the ED. A descriptive cohort {{study was conducted in}} a Dutch level 1 trauma centre. Differences in patient characteristics, time of presentation and need for <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> were analysed using χ (2) tests and t tests. A patient was considered to need <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> when he/she was admitted to the hospital, had an extremity fracture and/or when diagnostic tests were performed. Main determinants of self-referral were identified via logistic regression. Of the 5, 003 consecutive ED patients registering within the 5 -week study period, 3, 028 (60. 5 %) were self-referrals. Thirty-nine percent of the self-referrals had urgent acuity levels, as opposed to 65 % of the non-self-referrals. Self-referrals more often suffered from injuries (49 vs. 20 %). One third of the self-referrals presented during office hours.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Geospatial {{analysis}} is increasingly {{being used to}} evaluate the design and effectiveness of trauma systems, but there are no metrics to describe the geographic distribution of incidents. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of using spatial analysis to characterize, at scale, the geospatial profile of an injured population. METHODS: This is a prospective national cohort study of all trauma patients attended to by the Scottish Ambulance Service in a complete year (between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014). Incident location and severity were collected at source. Incident distribution was evaluated using geostatistical techniques. RESULTS: There were 80, 391 recorded incidents involving traumatic injury. Incident density was highest in the central Southern part of the country and along the East coast, broadly following the population distribution and road network. The overall distribution was highly clustered, and centered on the central Southern and Eastern parts of the country. When analyzed by triage category, the distribution of incidents triaged to major trauma center care was slightly less clustered than that of incidents triaged to trauma unit or local <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care,</b> but the spread was similar. When analyzed by type of injury, assaults and falls were more clustered than incidents relating to traffic and transportation.

40|$|Background: Comparability of {{the quality}} of medical care for {{children}} in different types of in-patient hospitals remains a subject of debate. Objective: Our aim was to compare the quality of <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> for children with severe traumas in pediatric and non-pediatric in-patient hospitals. Methods : Retrospective cohort (continuous) research. We analyzed medical records of intensive care patients (form 003 /u) with severe traumas at the age of 1 month to 18 years hospitalized to in-patient hospitals of Rostov Oblast in  2010 – 2014. The quality of medical care was assessed according to duration of diagnostic maneuvers that led to the diagnosis and surgical activity (frequency of surgical interventions for the condition that led to hospitalization). Results : We analyzed the data on  134 children with severe mechanical traumas hospitalized to pediatric (n = 29) and non-pediatric (n = 105) in-patient hospitals. Lifethreatening traumas (Pediatric Trauma Score 8 points) were recorded in 26 (90 %) and 79 (75 %) children, respectively (p = 0. 127).  The duration of the diagnosis stage in two groups was 135 (120; 160) and 140 (110, 210) minutes, respectively (p = 0. 548). Surgical activity was higher in pediatric in-patient hospitals: surgical interventions were performed in 16 (55 %) children compared to 37 (35 %)  cases in the group of children admitted to non-pediatric hospitals (p = 0. 052). Conclusion: The quality of emergency in-patient hospital care for children with severe traumas in pediatric and non-pediatric hospitals does not differ significantly. </p...|$|E
40|$|Eating {{problems}} and nutritional status were studied in a consecutive series of 104 stroke patients admitted to <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care.</b> During their stay in hospital eating problems {{were observed in}} 46 patients. Certain common types of eating problems were identified: aberrant eating behaviour as regards chewing,lokalization or swallowing, eating small amounts, hoarding of food in the mouth, leakage of food from the mouth and unawareness of eating problems. Poor nutritional status occurred in 16 % of the patients on admission and in 22 % on discharge from the stroke unit. A subgroup of 32 patients hospitalized for 21 days or longer was studied for three weeks. On at least one occasion during these three weeks a poor nutritional status was observed in 18 patients, of whom 17 had eating problems. All subjects who had eating problems during their hospital stay, plus those patients without eating problems but with neurological deficits and those living {{in a nursing home}} one year after the stroke (n= 36) were selected for a longitudinal study 18 months after the onset of stroke. Eating problems were identified in 23 of these patients during their hospital stay while 21 had such problems when they were followed up. Two patients who could not eat due to severe dysphagia (after a stroke) for three years and 18 months respectively, were successfully trained to eat normally. One patient exhibited impaired oral and hypopharyngeal function and the other impaired hypo- pharyngeal function and a spastic crico-pharyngeal muscle. In both patients training in swallowing was the main remedical measure and one of them also had a myotomy of the spastic muscle.

40|$|Dengue virus (DENV) is an arthropod-borne {{virus and}} has become a {{worldwide}} problem with steadily rising annual infection rates. Patients present with a range of symptoms from mild fever to, in some cases, life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. The most severe cases require <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> and currently, there is no effective drug treatment or vaccine for dengue. As severe symptoms appear post-peak viremia, immuno-pathology is thought to be the cause and a potential trigger of this is differential activation of the immune response upon recognition of DENV. This could be due to a combination of factors including varying receptors, signalling pathways and immune regulation mechanisms. In order to understand DENV infection better, it is imperative to study the mechanisms of activation and control of immune responses triggered by the virus. Very early events in viral infection (after 10 min stimulation) were studied aiming to identify proteins involved in differential activation of immune responses. Phosphorylated proteins were isolated from cells post-stimulation and analysed by mass spectrometry. More than 200 proteins were differentially regulated by phosphorylation in response to DENV stimulation as compared to Mock, Influenza A virus and LPS stimulation. 	 The effect of two specific proteins, namely Calpain- 2 and Importin- 5, identified to be differentially phosphorylated was investigated further. Calpain- 2 was seen to be vital in the efficient production of progeny virions and the transcription of Mx 1, an anti-viral interferon stimulated gene. Importin- 5 is known to transport DENV NS 5 into the nucleus during infection and was seen to co-precipitate with many host proteins. In summary, it is imperative that novel treatments and vaccines are developed for dengue as {{it is one of the}} worldâs most prevalent arthropod-borne viruses. It was discovered here that many proteins undergo phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation in response to DENV stimulation to a differing degree than other stimuli. Calpain- 2 plays a vital role DENV infection, potentially influencing the potency of immune response. Importin- 5 associates with various host proteins during DENV infection, potentially altering their function or the function of Importin- 5 itself. Research into targeted inhibition of Calpain- 2 function or Importin- 5 interaction with DENV NS 5 could lead to a successful anti-viral treatment for DENV infection. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study with 400 patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction (MI) {{was conducted at}} the Cardiology department at Malmö University hospital in Sweden, between 2002 and 2005. The aim {{of the project was}} to identify personality and psychosocial factors, influencing patients’ actions and the prognoses after MI. The five factor model of personality, (measures on Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness), coping strategies, depressive symptoms, the impact on delay seeking emergency care, smoking habits and cardiac health care utilization were studied. This thesis reports the result from four papers. In paper I the aim was to investigate whether maladaptive behaviour in the serial Color Word Test (CWT) alone or in combination with any specific personality dimensions were associated with severity of the MI. The indicators of severity of disease were maximum levels above median of the cardiac biomarkers troponin I and creatine-kinase-MB (CKMB), Q-wave infarctions, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The findings showed that maladaptive behaviour in combination with low scores on extraversion was associated with higher levels in cardiac biomarkers, following an MI. Another crucial factor for the prognoses and survival after a MI is early arrival to the emergency department and rapid intervention. In paper II we analysed the correlation of personality and psychosocial factors, with the time lag between the onset of coronary symptoms and seeking <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care.</b> There was no significant conjunction in time delay and personality factors, coping strategies and depression. In paper III we examined whether personality traits, coping strategies and symptoms of depression were related to smoking cessation after an MI. Out of the 149 patients who smoked at baseline, 2 years follow-up data was available on 133 individuals, of these 44 % (n= 59) still smoked and 56 % (n= 74) had stopped smoking during the 2 years. Those who still smoked had lower score in the personality factor agreeableness, more lived alone and were unemployed in contrast to those who had stopped smoking. They also had significantly higher coping scores as confrontational behaviour. Finally, in paper IV we examined whether personality factors and depressive symptoms predicted cardiac health care utilization over the first two years after the MI event. Those MI patients showing traits of Neuroticism at baseline had significantly higher utilization at the out-patient cardiac clinic than those without. Individuals with a high score of depressive symptoms at baseline had instead a higher utilization of social workers and telephone contacts over the two year follow-up. In conclusion, we found that the personality factors extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism were factors that had impact on MI severity, smoking cessation and out-patient clinic contacts, while delay in seeking acute care was not affected by personality factors, depression or coping strategies. Maladaptive behaviour and a confronting coping strategy influenced MI severity and smoking cessation 2 years after an MI. Taking personality factors and coping strategies more into consideration when caring for patients in cardiac rehabilitation might be indicated...|$|E
40|$|Background Tobacco control policies, such as {{legislation}} {{to make all}} enclosed public places and workplaces smoke free, are often highly contested. Despite growing evidence that smoke-free laws are effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure and provide early health benefits, efforts to contest evidence for secondhand smoke {{and the effects of}} legislation are widespread. The Tobacco Control Research Group at Bath, UK, has produced a wide range of work assessing various effects of smoke-free legislation introduced on July 1, 2007, in England. We use our assessment of whether the legislation reduced hospital admissions for heart attacks as an example of our research. When this assessment was published in the British Medical Journal in 2010, several studies showing a decrease in admissions for heart attack after the introduction of smoke-free laws in other countries had already been published. In view of efforts to contest these findings by pro-tobacco bloggers, media articles questioning the credibility of tobacco control research, and spurious coverage of our work in national newspapers before it was published, we had two aims: to build on existing research by taking into account long-term trends; and to ensure the findings, when published, were accurately reported in the media and to policy makers. Methods We investigated the short-term effect of the English smoke-free legislation with numbers of emergency hospital admissions per week coded with a primary diagnosis of a myocardial infarction from July 1, 2002, to Sept 30, 2008, in all patients aged 18 years and older. The analysis was done with a segmented Poisson regression analysis that adjusted for long-term trends and other potential confounders. Cost savings to the NHS were calculated in collaboration with the London Health Observatory. For the media strategy, we prepared simple but accurate media briefings, which we disseminated to ten key parties that were likely to be contacted by the media. We held a press briefing at the Science Media Centre (London), and worked closely with them, Bath University press office, and the British Medical Journal. Findings Smoke-free legislation was association with a 2 · 4 % (95 % CI − 4 · 06 to − 0 · 66) {{reduction in the number of}} emergency admissions for myocardial infarction. This reduction equates to 1200 fewer emergency admissions for myocardial infarction in the first year after legislation. The London Health Observatory estimated that £ 8 · 4 million has been saved in <b>emergency</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> for heart attacks in the first year since smoke-free legislation was introduced. The research received wide reaching, positive coverage in both print and broadcast media, featuring on the BBC, BBC Radio 4 's Today programme, BBC Radio 5 Live, and local BBC radio stations. National newspapers that featured the story included The Times, Financial Times, Independent, and Daily Mail. Internationally, the research was reported by media in several countries, including the USA, Canada, and New Zealand. Our efforts to ensure that coverage was accurate were successful, despite later efforts by pro-tobacco bloggers to undermine it. Interpretation This study adds to the growing evidence that smoke-free legislation leads to reductions in myocardial infarctions and builds on previous work by showing that such decreases are noted even when underlying reductions in admissions and other potential confounders are controlled for. With careful planning and communication, public health research in a contested field can be effectively and accurately disseminated. The research has subsequently contributed to the present government's tobacco control strategy...|$|E
