2500|$|Returning {{to work in}} 1953, he {{accepted}} a position as a Mechanical Engineering Specialist with Shell, where he developed {{a new type of}} self-powered drill driven by a turbine running on the lubricating mud that is pumped into the borehole during drilling. Normally a well is drilled by attaching rigid sections of pipe together and powering the cutting head by spinning the pipe from the surface, but Whittle's design removed the need for a strong mechanical connection between the drill and the <b>head</b> <b>frame,</b> allowing for much lighter piping to be used. [...] He gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1954 on The Story of Petroleum.|$|E
2500|$|The Mansfield Mine Location Historic District is a {{collection}} of log buildings located on Stream Road in Mansfield Township. [...] Mining exploration was started in the area in 1882, but was unsuccessful until the founding of the Mansfield Mine in 1889 by the Mansfield Mining Company. [...] A railroad spur was built to the location in 1890, and the area grew quickly. On September 28, 1893, a cave-in occurred, collapsing multiple levels of the mine and allowing the waters of the overhead Michigamme River to break into the mine, drowning twenty-seven of the forty-eight miners working on the site. The incident is still the single worst mining accident in Iron County's history. [...] The mine closed after the accident and all items of value removed. [...] In 1894, a forest fire destroyed all of the original buildings save the timber <b>head</b> <b>frame.</b> In 1896, the DeSoto Iron Company of Springfield, Illinois bought the property, diverted the river, and reopened the mine. Mining continued until 1913, when the Mansfield closed for good.|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} of opening the mine was to dig the shaft. Initially a small {{makeshift}} frame {{would be used to}} shift the spoil, but as the shaft grew deeper a proper <b>head</b> <b>frame</b> would be erected over it with a winch to raise and lower the bowk. This was eventually replaced by a cage.|$|E
50|$|The shaft is {{open and}} well defined behind a 12m x 13m chain wire safety fence erected in the 1960s by the City Council.

50|$|Copper slate or schist was mined in the Mansfeld Land, {{southeast}} Harz and southeastern Harz Foreland from 1200 to 1990., {{for example}} in the Sangerhausen Field (Sangerhäuser Revier) and thus in the Röhrigschacht.

50|$|When in use {{the shaft}} was in three compartments. In 1898 {{it is known}} the {{vertical}} descent of the shaft was 868 ft with two underlies going north east and north west. The total depth {{at the time was}} 1078 ft. The capital brace was 40 feet high and was quite distinctive with a long raised walkway to the east. The <b>head</b> <b>frame</b> was an open timber structure. In 1897 The North Queensland Register listed the equipment on the surface to include a 430-ton hopper, a stone breaker, a 28 hp engine, two air compressors, two robey boilers, six rock drills and an underground air machine.|$|E
50|$|Above {{the eastern}} {{entrance}} to the station concourse is a semi-circular, stained glass window divided by four pillars into five sections.

It includes a harbour crane, a canal bridge, buildings and chimneys of the mine, two <b>head</b> <b>frames,</b> cooling towers, slag heaps and colliery village houses. The windows were first installed in 1953 and were donated by the Friedrich der Große colliery.|$|R
50|$|Walkerville {{represents}} some of {{the earliest}} mines in the district and preserves the early mining camp flavor present in the 1890s to 1910s. Butte itself is an urban metropolis where industrial relics such as mine yards and <b>head</b> <b>frames</b> are juxtaposed {{with a wide variety of}} residential and business structures. Anaconda was created as a company town that contained the smelters for Butte's ore. The Butte Anaconda and Pacific Railroad, connecting Butte and Anaconda, is a designated part of the expanded National Historic Landmark District.|$|R
