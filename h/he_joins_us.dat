"We have {{a trained}} army at our disposal," [...] Monsieur de Founcelles continued, [...] "who numerically, {{as well as}} in intelligence, outnumber the whole force of gendarmes in Paris. No {{criminal}} from any other country can settle down here and hope for success, unless <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us.</b> An exploit which is inspired by us cannot fail. Our agents may count on our protection, and receive it without question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother imagines that I am the slavish echo of {{my brother}} Victor. It is not so. He {{understand}}s me better than I can understand him. When <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> and you come to know him you will see what an exceptional soul it is." [...] She paused. [...] "He is not a strong man in the conventional sense, you know," [...] she added. [...] "But his character is without a flaw." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Content am I," [...] said Bucklaw; [...] "Scotland {{has little}} left that I care about; and if {{carrying}} the Master with us will {{get us a}} better reception in France, why, so be it, a God's name. I doubt our own merits will procure us slender preferment; and I trust he will send a ball through the Keeper's head before <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us.</b> One or two of these scoundrel statesmen should be shot once a year, {{just to keep the}} others on their good behaviour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will do, my man," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, nodding his head. [...] "Don't trouble {{yourself}} about the cleverness or the cunning {{that may be}} wanted. My clerk has got head enough for two. I have only one word more to say before you go downstairs again. Remember that this investigation and the cause that leads to it must be kept a profound secret. Except us three, and the clergyman here (to whom your mistress has written word of what has happened), nobody knows anything about it. I will let my clerk into the secret when <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us.</b> As soon as you and he are away from the house, you may talk about it. Until then, you will close your lips on the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Oswald said, [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> at Shrewsbury, {{before the}} king comes up, {{it will not}} matter much; and indeed would be, in one respect, the better. Mortimer with his force will be coming on; and though he is scarce likely to arrive at Shrewsbury {{in time for the}} battle, for he could not leave Wales, to summon his levies to the field, until the Prince of Wales had drawn off his force and marched to join his father; his reinforcement, afterwards, will fill up the gaps in our ranks, and be a great assistance, should Henry be able to rally another army in the Midlands. He cannot hope to do so before we reach London." ...|$|E

60|$|The affliction {{which has}} befallen me has left certain duties to be {{performed}} that require my presence in London. My house is let; I am staying at a hotel. My friend, Sir James (also in London on business), has rooms near mine. We breakfast and dine together in my sitting-room. For the moment solitude is dreadful to me, and yet I cannot go into society; I shrink from persons who are mere acquaintances. At Sir James's suggestion, however, one visitor at the hotel {{has been asked to}} dine with us, who claims distinction as no ordinary guest. The physician who first warned me of the critical state of my mother's health is anxious to hear what I can tell him of her last moments. His time is too precious to be wasted in the earlier hours of the day, and <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> at the dinner-table when his patients leave him free to visit his friends.|$|E

So, you see, he can afford to disregard the enmity of her father, as well as the displeasure of the king, which probably would soon abate after the marriage took place. If I had known, when I left home, what had happened, and that if she was found we should be returning home, I would have brought with me a dozen stout fellows from my own estate. As it is, I sent off a messenger, yesterday, with an order to my majordomo to pick out that number of active fellows, from among the tenantry, and to start with the least possible delay by the route that we shall follow, of which I have given him particulars. He is to ride forward until he meets us, so that when <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us,</b> we shall be too strong a party for any force that the vicomte is likely to gather to intercept us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear friend," [...] she wrote, [...] "your {{generous and}} {{satisfactory}} answer [...] came yesterday. It was so delicate and high,-minded, and so like [...] you, {{to write to}} Mr. Durgin, and leave the whole affair to him; and [...] he did not lose a moment in showing us your beautiful letter. He [...] said you were a man after his own heart, and I wish you could have [...] heard how he praised you. It made Genevieve quite jealous, or would [...] have, {{if it had been}} any one else. But she is so happy in your [...] approval of her marriage, which is to take place before the [...] 'sindaco' to-morrow, We shall only have the civil rite; she feels [...] that it is more American, and we are all coming home to Lion's Head [...] in the spring to live and die true Americans. I wish you could [...] spend the summer with us there, but, until Lion's Head is rebuilt, [...] we can't ask you. I don't know exactly how we shall do ourselves, [...] but Mr. Durgin is full of plans, and we leave everything to him. [...] He is here, making Genevieve laugh so that I can hardly write. [...] <b>He</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> in love and thanks, and our darling Bice sends you a [...] little kiss.|$|E

6000|$|... "I expect not. Sir Arthur won't {{determine}} {{anything until}} <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> after {{his visit to}} Corunna, but I don't {{think that it will}} be at Lisbon, anyhow. There are strong forts guarding the mouth of the river, and ten or twelve thousand troops in the city, and a Russian fleet anchored in the port. I don't know where it will be, but I don't think that it will be Lisbon. I expect that we shall slip into some little port, land, and wait for Junot to attack us; we shall be joined, I expect, by Stewart's force, that have been fooling about for two or three months waiting for the Spaniards to make up their minds whether they will admit them into Cadiz or not. You see, at present there are only 9,000 of us, and they say that Junot has at least 50,000 in Portugal; but of course they are scattered about, and it is hardly likely that he would venture to withdraw all his garrisons from the large towns, so that the odds may not be as heavy as they look, when we meet him in the field. And I suppose that at any rate some of the Portuguese will join us. From what I hear, the peasantry are brave enough, only they have never had a chance yet of making a fight for it, owing to their miserable government, which never can make up its mind to do anything. I hope that Sir Arthur has orders, as soon as he takes Lisbon, to assume the entire control of the country and ignore the native government altogether. Even if they are worth anything, which they are sure not to be, it is better to have one head than two, and as we shall have to do all the fighting, it's just as well that we should have the whole control of things too." ...|$|E
40|$|The world's {{food sources}} are under pressure, from climate change, {{population}} growth and an over-reliance on a few key crops - rice, maize and wheat. If one of these crops were to fail we'd be in trouble, {{but there is an}} insurance policy - thousands of wild ancestor seeds, kept under lock and key, to call upon when we need to find genetic resistance to a new disease or pest.

40|$|The Bible, {{according}} to scholars of early Christianity, {{is not the}} straightforward explanation of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s life. In fact, new discoveries and research show {{that there were many}} different gospels circulating in the first century of the Christian Church and that meant many different versions of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s message. In fact, one gospel even suggests that Jesus was married. So what does it all mean? And what does it tell us about Christianity?
