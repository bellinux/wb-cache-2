25|$|In 2014, RCR ran the 33 in {{the first}} two races of the season with Scott and his family's Whitetail Club. Scott {{finished}} fifth in his Daytona Duel to earn a spot in the Daytona 500, then finished 25th in the race after several accidents. Scott ran the next race at Phoenix, starting and finishing 32nd. Scott was involved in a controversy in the fifth race of the season at Fontana, when he spun out Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Series regular Aric Almirola, who expressed displeasure at Scott's driving and source of sponsorship after <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Scott would finish 35th in that race. Brian then won the pole at the spring Talladega race, his first career Cup pole. Scott would not lead any laps, however, and finished 42nd after crashing out. 2000 Cup Champion Bobby Labonte, who was doing test driving for RCR, drove the same car at the summer Daytona race, under the Circle Sport banner. The car again had speed in qualifying, timing in 4th. Labonte would contend for the lead for much of the race but finish 26th after being swept up in the Big One. Richard Childress' younger grandson Ty Dillon drove at Atlanta and Phoenix in the fall, with sponsorship from Rheem, Realtree and Charter Communications.|$|E
500|$|The weekend marked Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert and Sauber's Pedro Diniz final race. It was {{announced}} shortly beforehand that Herbert {{would move to}} the CART series and he confirmed that he rejected an offer to take up an testing position for the Williams team. Herbert said going into the weekend: [...] "It's {{going to be a}} bit emotional <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> for the last time and out of Formula One. But I'm really looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead of me." [...] Diniz's future however was uncertain as he was rumored to be moving to Prost after undergoing extensive negotiations with the team.|$|E

2500|$|As Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were {{returning}} to Buckingham Palace on 20 March 1974, from a charity event on Pall Mall, their Princess IV car {{was forced to}} stop on the Mall by a Ford Escort. The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball, jumped out and began firing a pistol. Inspector James Beaton, Anne's personal police officer, responded by <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in order to shield her and to attempt to disarm Ball. Beaton's firearm, a Walther PPK, jammed, and he was shot by the assailant, as was Anne's chauffeur, Alex Callender, {{when he tried to}} disarm Ball. Brian McConnell, a nearby tabloid journalist, also intervened, and was shot in the chest. Ball approached Anne's car and told her of his kidnapping plan, which was to hold her for ransom, the sum given by varying sources as £2million or £3million, which he claimed he intended to give to the National Health Service. Ball then directed Anne {{to get out of the}} car, to which she replied: [...] "Not bloody likely!", and reportedly briefly considered hitting Ball. Eventually, she exited the other side of the limousine as had her lady-in-waiting, Rowena Brassey. A passing pedestrian, a former boxer named Ron Russell, punched Ball in the back of the head and then led Anne away from the scene. At that point, Police Constable Michael Hills happened upon the situation; he too was shot by Ball, but not before he called for police backup. Detective Constable Peter Edmonds, who had been nearby, answered and gave chase, finally arresting Ball.|$|E
60|$|<b>Getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{and leaving}} {{it by the}} curb, we walked with some {{difficulty}} along the crowded pavement of King William Street and entered {{the open door of}} a large insurance office. It was a corner house, and we chose it as commanding a view in every direction. Ascending the stair, we passed through what I suppose to have been the board-room, for eight elderly men were seated round a long table in the centre of it. The high window was open and we all stepped out upon the balcony. From it we could see the crowded city streets radiating in every direction, while below us the road was black from side to side with the tops of the motionless taxis. All, or nearly all, had their heads pointed outwards, showing how the terrified men of the city had at the last moment made a vain endeavor to rejoin their families in the suburbs or the country. Here and there amid the humbler cabs towered the great brass-spangled motor-car of some wealthy magnate, wedged hopelessly among the dammed stream of arrested traffic. Just beneath us there was such a one of great size and luxurious appearance, with its owner, a fat old man, leaning out, half his gross body through the window, and his podgy hand, gleaming with diamonds, outstretched as he urged his chauffeur to make a last effort to break through the press.|$|E
6000|$|He {{determined}} to keep this purpose steadily in mind, not to lose thought of it for an instant; it was his only refuge. Then a new anguish seized him; a doubt that swiftly became certainty; {{and he knew that}} he had signed that dispatch Northwick and not Warwick; he saw just how his signature looked on the yellow manilla paper of the telegraph blank. Now he saw what a fool he had been to think of sending any dispatch. He cursed himself under his breath, and in the same breath he humbly prayed to God for some way of escape. His terror made it certain to him that he would be arrested as soon as he reached Wellwater. That would be the next stop, the conductor told him, when he halted him with the question on his way through the cars. The conductor said they were behind time, and Northwick knew by the frantic pull of the train that they were running to make up the loss. It would simply be death to jump from the car; and he must not die, he must run the risk. In his prayer he bargained with God that if He would let him escape, he would give every thought, every breath to making up the loss of his creditors; he half promised to return the money he was carrying away, and trust to his own powers, his business talent in a new field, to retrieve himself. He resolved to hide himself as soon as he reached Wellwater; it would be dark, and he hoped that by this understanding with Providence he could elude the officer in <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> But if there were two, one {{at each end of the}} car? ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Dillon, Marchant {{had been}} due to meet Craig outside [...] "The Eagle" [...] before he was shot dead. Instead of <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at the chip shop where Marchant waited, Craig got out at the Inter-City {{furniture}} shop {{on the corner of}} Conway Street. There he engaged in conversation with another person for five minutes. Within the five minutes, Marchant was gunned down just 50 yards away. In October 1988, Craig was shot to death in an East Belfast pub by the UDA (using their cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters) for [...] "treason", claiming that he had been involved in the death of UDA leader John McMichael, who was blown up the previous December in a booby-trap car bomb planted by the IRA.|$|E

50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to clear it. This experience led to his invention of the windscreen wiper. In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design of a windscreen wiper with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool. Gladstone's version of the windscreen wiper was never manufactured, however. His original prototype can be seen in Newcastle's Discovery Museum.|$|E
5000|$|At about 5 {{o'clock in}} the afternoon, on Via Durruti, (current Via Laietana) two cars were coming up {{the street from the}} {{direction}} of the docks to get to the Casa CNT-FAI, headquarters of the Regional Committees. Some 300 metres away a barricade of Catalan city guards and members of the PSUC, with red arm-bands was located. As the cars approached this barricade, they were ordered to stop and surrender their weapons. As they were <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to carry out the order, they were shot down by volleys of rifle fire. The POUM began to support resistance publicly. In shootings occurring during this day the well-known libertarian Domingo Ascaso, family of the mythical Francisco Ascaso and president of the Regional Council of Defense of Aragon Joaquín Ascaso, was killed.
