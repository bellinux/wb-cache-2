5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth {{man would be}} allowed to take to the field in the place of one of the players and {{would be allowed to}} bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a full cap. These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E

25|$|The body of {{the ferry}} pilot was autopsied by Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard. The blood alcohol level was {{determined}} to be 0.09%, just shy of the legal definition of alcohol intoxication (in 1976) of 0.10%. (The laws in Louisiana and every other state <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> 1976; Auletta would have been defined as legally intoxicated under today's law in all 50 states.) No other drugs were present. Minyard's report stated that the pilot, Egidio Auletta, had been drinking and was experiencing a large degree of impairment {{at the time of his}} death at the helm.|$|E

25|$|Police {{announced}} in January that the DNA {{from the scene}} had come back as belonging to a male. From the crime scene and other evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had developed {{a profile of the}} man. They said it was likely that he had lived near Hedgepeth in the past, had expressed an interest in her and his behavior may <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the crime, including showing an unusual interest in the case. Notwithstanding this release of information, the town successfully petitioned the court to keep the warrants under seal, saying that phase of the investigation was still not complete; in May 2013 the court extended the seal another 60 days.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} and opening of the Center City Commuter Connection Tunnel in 1984, lines were paired such that a former Pennsylvania Railroad line was coupled with a former Reading line. Seven such pairings were created and given route designations numbered R1 through R8 (with R4 not used). As a result, the routes were originally designed so that trains would proceed from one outlying terminal to Center City, stopping at 30th Street Station, Suburban Station and Jefferson Station (formerly Market East Station), then proceed out to the other outlying terminal assigned to the route. Since ridership patterns <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the implementation of this plan, SEPTA removed the R-numbers from the lines in July 2010 and instead refers to the lines by {{the names of their}} termini.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{arguments}} against evolution <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the publishing of Henry M. Morris' first {{book on the}} subject, Scientific Creationism (1974), but some consistent themes remain: that missing links or gaps in the fossil record are proof against evolution; that the increased complexity of organisms over time through evolution is not possible due {{to the law of}} increasing entropy; that it is impossible that the mechanism of natural selection could account for common ancestry; and that evolutionary theory is untestable. The origin of the human species is particularly hotly contested; the fossil remains of purported hominid ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving Homo sapiens. Creationists also assert that early hominids, are either apes, or humans.|$|E

25|$|By January 1956 {{the first}} Bahá'í arrived on Pemba Island. Later in 1956 Shoghi Effendi {{called for the}} {{establishment}} of regional national assemblies of Bahá'ís to supervise the developing communities in regions of Africa.
