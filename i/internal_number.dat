40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the ability to}} evaluate prices in a familiar currency (French Francs, Portuguese Escudos or Irish Punt) and in an unfamiliar currency (Euro). Participants evaluated prices for different items either by selecting the most appropriate price from a set of alternatives (in a timed or not timed version) or by directly producing a price estimate for each item. The results followed Weber's law: the standard deviation of estimated prices was proportional to their mean. The Weber fraction was stable for the familiar currency in different countries, but was significantly higher for the unfamiliar currency. We suggest that price estimation relies on a learned mapping between items and their prices as represented by distributions of activation on an <b>internal</b> <b>number</b> line. The observed Weber fraction reflects the degree of expertise with a given currency {{as well as a}} minimal variability intrinsic to the number line itself.

40|$|AbstractAfter a short {{historical}} introduction {{the role}} of Kekulé structures in theoretical chemistry is summarized. The present work concentrates upon conjugated hydrocarbons with six-membered rings. In a mathematical treatment they are represented by benzenoid systems, which consist of congruent regular hexagons. The vertices represent carbon atoms. Relations are given between certain characteristic numbers, viz. the number of vertices of different kinds (secondary, tertiary, external, <b>internal),</b> <b>number</b> of edges and of the rings. Kekuléan and non-Kekuléan benzenoids are exemplified. The latter class consists of mathematical constructions without any possible Kekulé structure. A great amount of {{work has been done}} in the area of graph theory applied to benzenoids. Some of the most important theorems are summarized. Another approach employs group theory in the studies of the symmetry of Kekulé structures. A benzenoid or one of its Kekulé structures may belong to one of the following eight symmetry groups: Examples are given. Cata-condensed benzenoids are defined by having no internal vertices. Especially simple are the single straight and single zig-zag chains. The number of Kekulé structures and their symmetries are treated in these two cases. In the latter case the Fibonacci numbers come in. Some classes of reticular benzenoids are defined, and the multiple zig-zag chains are considered in some detail. A recurrence formula for the number of Kekulé structures with relevance to this class of benzenoids is presented for the first time, along with several deductions from it...|$|E
30|$|The New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit is a {{suitable}} species for tolerability tests conventional to regulatory authorities and is entreated following the guideline ISO 10993 – 6. The {{study was conducted}} by {{the requirements of the}} Council Directive 86 / 609 /EEC and subsequent amendments on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes or procedures. As no gender-specific differences are expected, only female animals were used in this study (Arzi et al. 2012). Eighteen NZW rabbits (8  months-old females, weight-range 4.3 – 5.5  kg) were purchased from S & K LAP Kft (Kartal, Hungary) in a good conventional health status. Before study initiation, the animals were accustomed to laboratory conditions for 2  weeks. A veterinarian on arrival examined the health status of the animals used in this study and before beginning the study. On the day of animal delivery, animals were allocated to the test groups and were marked individually by ear tags done by the supplier. Additionally, a waterproof ink was used to mark animals with their <b>internal</b> <b>number</b> {{on the inside of the}} ear. Room temperature was adjusted to 20 [*]±[*] 3  °C, and the relative humidity was set at 30 – 70 %. Artificial light was scheduled to give a cycle of 12  h light and 12  h dark (LD 12 : 12) with the light on at 6 : 30  a.m. Each rabbit was housed in a cage of stainless steel with the bottom grid. The animals were fed with a pellet diet and had access to tap water continuously.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} an entangled system, {{which is}} analogous to a composite system {{of a black hole}} and Hawking radiation. If Hawking radiation is well approximated by an outgoing particle generated from a pair creation around the black hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There should be a unitary mechanism {{to reduce the number of}} states inside the horizon for black hole evaporation. Since the infalling antiparticle has negative energy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that two particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy system by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model calculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible before the Page time, while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after the Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair forms a separable state, the <b>internal</b> <b>number</b> of states will monotonically increase, which is supported by the AMPS argument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the entire system and hence the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based on these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant picture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity, semi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black hole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time at the latest, and hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be applied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic.
