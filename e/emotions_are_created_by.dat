40|$|Young people’s {{recreational}} activities are based on, contain or are framed by music, where by choosing music and applying knowledge about styles they construct their identities and lifestyle projects. This study explores {{the relationship between}} music activities at school and in leisure time, how young people use and perceive music in these two environments and in what way they interact. Theories and research on late and post modernity, social construction, media, youth culture and music education are utilized in this study. Concepts such as authenticity, individualization, reflexives, aestheticization and makeability are concerns in the processing of the empirical data. The study {{is based on a}} survey, observations and interviews where three musical environments in two different upper secondary schools were investigated. 83 third-year pupils completed the survey, out of whom I interviewed 29 pupils. Music is pictured as an activity and a positioning of the individual in a social context, or as a construction of identity, as I prefer to put it. Emotions are essential in music, and according to the pupils <b>emotions</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the musician, mediated in music and interpreted by the listener. It is important to be authentic and to have a unique identity, which is possible to achieve in music. In the study pupils equal music to emotions and emotions to the self, which I define as Music = feelings = I. Music symbolizes cultural affiliation, lifestyle choices and ethical standpoints described in stereotypes which young people gather from various attributes and combine personally depending on the time and cause. It seems important to be open-minded and creative, which can be promoted by music activities according to the pupils. Music as a characteriser of identity seems to be at stake both in leisure time and at school. Based on the notion that young people’s behaviours are seismic readings of tendencies in society, this study implies that upper secondary school music activities are cultural investments in identity and in the students’ life projects...|$|E

In [...] "Hamlet and His Problems" [...] Eliot {{presents}} the phrase [...] "objective correlative." [...] The {{theory is that the}} expression of emotion in art can be achieved by a specific, and almost formulaic, prescription of a set of objects, including events and situations. A particular <b>emotion</b> <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> presenting its correlated objective sign. The author is depersonalised in this conception, since he is the mere effecter of the sign. And, it is the sign, and not the poet, which creates emotion.|$|R

40|$|With a few yet {{increasing}} number of exceptions, the cognitive sciences enthusiastically endorsed {{the idea that there}} are basic facial expressions of <b>emotions</b> that <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> specific configurations of facial muscles. We review evidence that suggests an inherent role for context in emotion perception. Context does not merely change emotion perception at the edges; it leads to radical categorical changes. The reviewed findings suggest that configurations of facial muscles are inherently ambiguous, and they call for a different approach towards the understanding of facial expressions of emotions. Prices of sticking with the modal view, and advantages of an expanded view, are succinctly reviewed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the plastic image of water as the metaphor for {{specific}} human emotions. Given its fluid nature, water itself does not have its own particular form of existence. However, influenced by the external environment, water creates various forms that suggest specific human <b>emotion.</b> These forms <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> forces of nature. I intend to create sculpture of the motion of water that evokes human emotion. The format for the idea is sculpture that consists of structural, repetitive and organized modules. I exploit the repetitive and sequential use of forms that provide an immediate feeling of visual unity. In this thesis I will discuss how my sculptural work explores water {{as a metaphor for}} human emotion...|$|R
5000|$|The {{appraisal}} {{theory of}} emotions {{centers on the}} assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences. <b>Emotions</b> <b>are</b> then <b>created</b> <b>by</b> different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through. When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience [...] Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience. Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory. People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia and Katherine {{separated}} from Alice Dunscombe {{in the lower}} gallery of the cloisters; and the cousins ascended to the apartment which was assigned them as a dressing-room. The intensity of feeling that was gradually accumulating in the breasts of the ladies, as circumstances brought those in whom their deepest interests were centred into situations of extreme delicacy, if not of actual danger, perhaps, in some measure, prevented them from experiencing all that concern which the detection and arrest of Merry might be supposed to excite. The boy, like themselves, {{was an only child}} of one of those three sisters, who caused the close connection of so many of our characters; and his tender years had led his cousins to regard him with an affection that exceeded the ordinary interest of such an affinity; but they knew that in the hands of Colonel Howard his person was safe, though his liberty might be endangered. When the first <b>emotions,</b> therefore, which <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> his sudden appearance after so long an absence had subsided, their thoughts were rather occupied by the consideration of what consequences, to others, might proceed from his arrest, than by any reflections on the midshipman's actual condition. Secluded from the observations of any strange eyes, the two maidens indulged their feelings, without restraint, according to their several temperaments. Katherine moved to and fro in the apartment, with feverish anxiety, while Miss Howard, by concealing her countenance under the ringlets of her luxuriant dark hair, and shading her eyes with a fair hand, seemed to be willing to commune with her thoughts more quietly.|$|R
60|$|Old writers had {{an admirable}} {{symbolism}} that attributed certain energies {{to the influence}} of the sun, and certain others to the lunar influence. To lunar influence belong all thoughts and <b>emotions</b> that <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the community, by the common people, by nobody knows who, and to the sun all that came from the high disciplined or individual kingly mind. I myself imagine a marriage of the sun and moon in the arts I take most pleasure in; and now bride and bridegroom but exchange, as it were, full cups of gold and silver, and now they are one in a mystical embrace. From the moon come the folk-songs imagined by reapers and spinners out of the common impulse of their labour, and made not by putting words together, but by mixing verses and phrases, and the folk-tales made by the capricious mixing of incidents known to everybody in new ways, as one deals out cards, never getting the same hand twice over. When one hears some fine story, one never knows whether it has not been hazard that put the last touch of adventure. Such poetry, as it seems to me, desires an infinity of wonder or emotion, for where there is no individual mind there is no measurer-out, no marker-in of limits. The poor fisher has no possession of the world and no responsibility for it; and if he dreams of a love-gift better than the brown shawl that seems too common for poetry, why should he not dream of a glove made from the skin of a bird, or shoes made from the skin of a herring, or a coat made from the glittering garment of the salmon? Was it not Æschylus who said he but served up fragments from the banquet of Homer?--but Homer himself found the great banquet of an earthen floor and under a broken roof. We do not know who at the foundation of the world made the banquet for the first time, or who put the pack of cards into rough hands; but we do know that, unless those that have made many inventions are about to change the nature of poetry, we may have to go where Homer went if we are to sing a new song. Is it because all that is under the moon thirsts to escape out of bounds, to lose itself in some unbounded tidal stream, that the songs of the folk are mournful, and that the story of the Fianna, whenever the queens lament for their lovers, reminds us of songs that are still sung in country-places? Their grief, even when it is to be brief like Grania's, goes up into the waste places of the sky. But in supreme art, or in supreme life there is the influence of the sun too, and the sun brings with it, as old writers tell us, not merely discipline but joy; for its discipline is not of the kind the multitudes impose upon us by their weight and pressure, but the expression of the individual soul, turning itself into a pure fire and imposing its own pattern, its own music, upon the heaviness and the dumbness that is in others and in itself. When we have drunk the cold cup of the moon's intoxication, we thirst for something beyond ourselves, and the mind flows outward to a natural immensity; but if we have drunk from the hot cup of the sun, our own fulness awakens, we desire little, for wherever one goes one's heart goes too; and if any ask what music is the sweetest, we can but answer, as Finn answered, 'What happens.' And yet the songs and stories that have come from either influence are a part, neither less than the other, of the pleasure that is the bride-bed of poetry.|$|R
