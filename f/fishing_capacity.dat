Humans may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries, aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is scientific evidence to support the assumption that <b>fish</b> have the <b>capacity</b> to experience pain because they possess functional nociceptors, endogenous opioids and opioid receptors, brain structures involved in pain processing and pathways leading from nociceptors to higher brain structures. Also, it is well documented that some anaesthetics and analgesics may reduce nociceptive responses in fish.

40|$|It is well {{established}} in the fisheries management literature that marine ecosystems are complex and marine species depend on one another.

This paper illustrates that if a conventional bioeconomic model is employed, an optimum effort policy as opposed to quota appears to result in sustainable management even if <b>fishing</b> impacts carrying <b>capacity.</b> However, the so-called optimum effort may collapse the stock if species diversity is not accounted for.

40|$|The spatial {{structure}} of {{commercial marine fisheries}} in Northwest (NW) Mexico was investigated using official landings data from 39 local fisheries offices in the region.

Five of the eight clusters comprised offices from the same geographic region and coastal ecosystem, and the other three clusters contained the largest industrial fishing ports in NW Mexico.

40|$|For active predatory <b>fish,</b> {{swimming}} <b>capacity</b> is {{a critical}} determinant of feeding success and survival. Sprint swimming influences a <b>fish’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to escape predators and to capture prey. Fast-starts, or startle responses, {{are some of the}} most rapid locomotory behaviours of vertebrates (Jayne and Lauder, 1993). Burst swimming, i. e. swimming activity lasting less than 20 ·s, also includes sprints that are slower and last longer than fast-start responses. Sprint swimming is powered by the white glycolytic fibres that constitute the bulk of the myotomal mass (Domenici and Blake, 1997; Franklin and Johnston, 1997). By contrast, sustained swimming allows fish to migrate long distances, maintain position or explore the environment in search of food or more favourable living conditions. Sustained swimming principally relies upon red oxidative fibres, as they are resistant to fatigue and have a slow shortening speed (Bone et al., 1978). Prolonged swimming is intermediate between sprint and sustained swimming. The Ucrit protocol, in which fish swim at gradually increasing speeds, is frequently used to evaluate prolonged swimming performance. In Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, glycolytic fibres are recruited during unsteady, burst–coast swimming towards the end of Ucrit tests (Reidy et al., 2000). Electromyography shows only red muscle activity during steady swimming, activation of red and white muscle during unsteady swimming and decreased red muscle activity with increasing speed (Jayne and Lauder, 1994). Whereas electromyographic studies are rarely coupled with Ucrit tests, electromyographic data suggest that white muscle becomes active only at speeds near Ucrit. However, in salmonids, white muscle is metabolically activated during swimming at speeds above 70 % Ucrit, with levels of phosphocreatine, glycogen and even ATP decreasing markedly (Burgetz et al., 1998; Richards et al., 2002). Prolonged swimming, as measured by the Ucrit protocol, relies upon both oxidative and glycolytic fibres. In temperate habitats, fish frequently encounter marked seasonal variations in food availability that may modify thei...|$|R

Our analyses showed a growing concern about fish welfare, although several questions remained inadequately covered. The most studied species was the Atlantic salmon, with Norway having the most publications on this theme. There are controversies among scientists about <b>fish</b> <b>capacity</b> for suffering and enjoyment (sentience). As regards slaughter or euthanasia, some studies showed that some methods are more endorsed than others, because they effectively reduce suffering and improve the appearance of the meat.

Thus, despite the importance of this subject, few studies are decisive and there is still no consensus on how to improve fish welfare or even on how to reduce suffering at the moment of slaughter. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of 0, 25, 50 and 75 % replacement of organic matter in the feed with rice straw compost on milkfish (Chanos chanos) growth and production. Treatments have similar organic matter and nitrogen loads. Up to 50 % substitution (Treatments 1 to 3) was possible without significantly affecting fish growth and yield (668 â€“ 725 kg/ha). A significant reduction in growth and yield (456 kg/ha) with 75 % substitution (Treatment 4) implies that organic matter from compost did not contribute much to fish growth. Low phosphorus content of compost and inadequate phosphorus load in spite of increasing mineral input from compost resulted in similar primary productivity in all treatments. It appeared that compost was not a satisfactory feed substitute and that the fish derived most of their nutrition from the feed. The results further suggest that yield could be economically increased by using a low protein diet (23. 8 %) given at a lower rate (1. 75 % of body weight). To further improve yield, feeding rate can be gradually increased as biomass increases, although the most cost-effective ration will depend on the <b>fish</b> <b>capacity</b> to grow under certain environmental conditions...|$|R

Placebo-infected controls completely compensated for a 2 -week deprivation period after 3 weeks postdeprivation feeding, but experimentally infected sticklebacks showed only partial compensation and after 6 weeks of refeeding had attained only 80 % of the weight of continually fed infected fish. A major factor limiting the compensatory growth response of infected fish was their reduced hyperphagic response during the period of refeeding. Feed deprivation had no effect on ultimate parasite size of infected fish. We discuss the possible mechanisms limiting hyperphagia in infected fish and consider the fitness implications ? for parasites and hosts ? of the reduced ability of infected fish to undertake compensatory growth responses.

Abstract : Due to {{possible}} risks for human health, {{in the last}} decades, several studies have been realized in evaluating the <b>fish</b> <b>capacity</b> in concentrate trace elements in the internal organs and muscle. This study verifies the bioaccumulation of trace elements and parasitological indexes of 120 Nile tilapia examined in two different properties, named as ?Swine-consorted? using pig manure, and ?Semi intensive?. For trace element analysis, the fish muscle tissue was collected individually in each property. Each portion was weighed, dried in oven at 60 °C for 48 h. and analyzed by the fluorescence spectrometry of X rays by energy dispersion (EDXRF). Parasitological analysis followed the routine method for parasites collection, quantification and identification. The predominant element was Zn followed by Fe and As in both properties. Parasitological analyses showed that fish from ?Swine-consorted? facility had greater values of abundance and mean intensity of trichodinids and in fish from ?Semi intensive? higher abundance and mean intensity of monogeneans was found. Nevertheless, no signs of injury to the creation was observed. The contents of the elements Zn, Fe, Cu, As and Hg were above the maximum limits recommended by the Brazilian legislation...|$|R
40|$|Nonylphenol is a {{biodegradation}} {{product of}} a widely used group of non-ionic detergents. Because of its ubiquitous distribution and persistence, nonylphenol is present in surface waters as a pollutant. Little is known about its biological effects at environmentally relevant concentrations other than its action as a xenoestrogen. The goal of the present paper was to study the trout gill surface epithelium as the major interface between fish and water in view of possible morphological alterations due to exposure to nonylphenol. Rainbow trout were intermittently exposed to 10 micrograms/l nonylphenol and gill samples from experimental and control animals were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Gill surface epithelium was scrutinised for changes in chloride cell density and their status regarding cell surface modifications. In addition, chloride cell fractional surface area (CCFA) was determined by morphometrical methods. Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant increase of CCFA in animals exposed to nonylphenol as compared to control animals (P = 0. 0001). Semi-quantitative assessment of the other parameters suggested a higher chloride cell density and {{a larger proportion of}} chloride cells bearing microvilli. Taken together, these results provide evidence that exposure of trout to nonylphenol is associated with a substantial increase in the active interface of chloride cells with water.
