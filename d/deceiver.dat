5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great <b>Deceiver)</b> and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, The <b>Deceiver</b> and a {{detachment}} {{travel to}} Forest Heart {{to locate a}} fragment of the Tain, in which Alric believes The Summoner to be hiding. They successfully find the fragment, enter the Tain, and kill The Summoner, cutting off Soulblighter from the Myrkridia. Acting on his own authority, The <b>Deceiver</b> then attacks Soulblighter's camp, {{but he and his}} men are captured. However, Phelot, a shade in charge of the prison, is in the service of The <b>Deceiver,</b> and frees them. The <b>Deceiver</b> attacks Soulblighter, who turns into a murder of crows to escape. He succeeds, but The <b>Deceiver</b> kills one of the crows, preventing him from fleeing in this manner again. The detachment then meet a scouting party near Silvermines; Alric and The Legion are moving to attack Soulblighter, but have been pinned down by Shiver, whom The <b>Deceiver</b> immediately heads to confront. He hunts her down, and Phelot destroys her army. The <b>Deceiver</b> then kills her, but her death triggers a magical energy backlash that also kills him.|$|E

30|$|Four factor theory [20] delineates four {{processes}} or {{factors that}} underlie deceivers’ behaviors. Control, the first process, describes how <b>deceivers</b> control or suppress their behavior {{to try to}} conceal their deception. For example, in 911 calls, <b>deceivers</b> will manage the linguistic and paralinguistic features of their interaction with the dispatcher in order to appear as truthful as possible and not to induce suspicion. The second factor, arousal, refers to various autonomic arousal responses of the <b>deceiver’s</b> central nervous system that coincide with the deceptive behavior or story. Felt emotion, the third factor, encompasses various emotions that <b>deceivers</b> experience, specifically guilt, anxiety, and/or satisfaction in pulling the wool over others’ eyes (i.e. “duping delight”). For instance, because of the negative feelings associated with guilt, <b>deceivers</b> try to disassociate themselves from their crime by referring to others {{rather than to the}} self through a greater use of through the use third-person pronouns. Anxiety may also impair the quality of the control that <b>deceivers</b> use to conceal their deception. Finally, due to the fourth factor, cognitive processing, <b>deceivers</b> have an increased cognitive load as they fabricate and maintain lies. This factor ties into a proposition of IDT, specifically that high cognitive load may be detrimental to a liar’s performance and increase the chances of detection. Because of this, <b>deceivers</b> in 911 calls may shorten their responses and use a smaller set of words.|$|R

Kina is a Goddess of Death, and the <b>Deceivers</b> are trying to bring her back to this world. Lady believes that she is using the <b>Deceivers</b> to further her agenda, while avoiding the seduction that Kina appears to be trying against her.|$|R
30|$|To {{define the}} types of cues that can be {{examined}} for deception or truthfulness in 911 calls, we suggest that truth tellers will exhibit more immediacy through greater use of first-person singular and first-person plural words. On the other hand, we expect <b>deceivers</b> will show more non-immediacy, a distancing from what is said, by referencing others in the third-person singular or plural. To control verbal output, or to suppress reactions or answers, <b>deceivers</b> will tend to answer more frequently with shorter, simpler “yes” or “no” answers. Because <b>deceivers</b> tend to suppress reactions, we expect that truth tellers will display more felt emotion. On the other hand, we anticipate that <b>deceivers</b> will use more swear words because instances of swearing can be perceived as more credible [36]. Thus, <b>deceivers</b> may include swear words {{as a way to}} appear to be emotionally connected to an incident while suppressing their true emotions. Relative to <b>deceivers,</b> truth tellers have a lower cognitive overload that allows them to give more location details, such as house numbers and generic information about location. Truth tellers want to provide many clues to get rescue teams to their location as quickly as possible, and will therefore provide specific addresses and phone numbers more clearly, as well as giving more details about the location, such as whether it is a house or apartment building. Finally, due to cognitive overload <b>deceivers</b> may be reluctant, or find it difficult to follow life-saving instructions given by the dispatcher even though not doing so would seem suspicious.|$|R

25|$|News soon reaches The Nine that Alric's {{army has}} been destroyed, {{and he has}} been {{captured}} by The <b>Deceiver.</b> He was sent to The Barrier to search for a suit of enchanted armor by the Head, who now claims to have been an ally of Connacht, although some are beginning to doubt the veracity of its claims. A small group from The Legion fly over the mountains in a hot air balloon, and rescue Alric. The Legion is then ordered to Silvermines to look for The Watcher's arm, lost when Balor freed him from captivity beneath the Cloudspine, as The Nine believe the arm can be used to fashion a weapon to use against The Watcher. However, The <b>Deceiver</b> is also in Silvermines searching for the arm, as he and The Watcher were enemies before the rise of Balor. The Legion find the arm, but soon thereafter, a volcano erupts, melting the snow on the Cloudspine, and allowing The <b>Deceiver</b> to move west. At the same time, The Watcher attacks Rabican's army, crushing it. However, the army of The <b>Deceiver,</b> heading west, and the army of The Watcher, pursuing the remnants of Rabican's army east, begin to fight one another, with Maeldun using the distraction to retake the passes.|$|E

40|$|Lying {{is known}} to evoke stress and {{cognitive}} load. Both form cues to deception and {{lead to an increase}} in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. But in reality, <b>deceivers</b> stick to the truth most the time and only lie occasionally. The present study therefore examined in an interactive suspect interview setting, whether <b>deceivers</b> still have clearly diverging cognitive and emotional processes from truth tellers when only having the intention to lie incidentally. We found that <b>deceivers</b> who lied constantly diverge from truth tellers in SNS activity, self-reported cognitive load and stress. Across all interviews, SNS activity correlated stronger with self-reports of cognitive load than stress, which supports the cognitive load approach. Furthermore, <b>deceivers</b> who told the truth and lied on only one crucial question, particularly diverged in self-reported stress from truth-tellers. In terms of SNS activity and self-reported cognitive load, no differences were found. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Christian millennialism is {{the belief}} in the resurrection of the martyrs and their thousand-year rule with Christ, {{followed}} by general resurrection, the last judgement, {{and the creation of a}} new heaven and new earth in which the faithful will be vindicated.

25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a <b>deceiver</b> and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience will not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{cognitive}} abilities {{are necessary for}} an animal to exhibit tactical deception. It might require the ability to understand another animal's point of view, or it might require only the use of specialized learned behaviours. These alternatives are hotly debated, and the answer tends to {{vary depending on the}} species being observed. In the first scenario, the <b>deceiver</b> would need a Theory of Mind which is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, knowledge, intents, desires, etc.) to another individual, The alternative view denies the need for such a capacity, but it does suggest the evolution of specialized brain functions responsible for social learning.|$|E
