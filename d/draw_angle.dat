This paper presents an experimental campaign to investigate AA 7075 -O aluminum alloy sheet forming using single point incremental forming (SPIF) technology {{and understand the}} forming process mechanism. Firstly, tensile tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical properties of AA 7075 -O sheets with three different thicknesses. Then, the effects of tool path types with different incremental steps on the maximum part <b>draw</b> <b>angle</b> and the successful part height were evaluated to clarify the formability. Additionally, a fracture forming limit diagram was developed to give the design limits for strain. Finally, the trends in forming forces were analyzed considering the influence of different draw angles, sheet thicknesses, step-down sizes and sheet orientations. Experimental results showed that formability {{is affected by the}} part <b>draw</b> <b>angle</b> and incremental steps of the tool path. However, the likelihood of successful forming also depends on other geometrical design parameters such as the part height. In addition, the influences of process parameters on tool forces provide further insights into the deformation mechanics of AA 7075 -O sheets. The slope of the force curve after the peak value can be identified as a forming failure prediction indicator regardless of the tool path types when using a truncated cone as a benchmark. Also the influence of sheet orientations on forming forces was investigated in SPIF. The vertical forming force is found to be smaller in a sheet orientation 45 to the rolling direction than that of a sheet orientation 0 for three different sheet thicknesses...|$|E

It is noted that stretching and thinning are two main deformation modes during SPIF. How to control material flow in an optimal way is a key point for successful forming. Multistage incremental forming shows more advantages than single-stage forming, especially dealing with shapes with steep walls. In this study, three basic multistage deformation path strategies have been proposed, that is: A. incremental part diameter; B. incremental draw angle; and C. incremental part height and <b>draw</b> <b>angle.</b> Those strategies and their combinations have been evaluated in terms of formability and compared {{in order to understand the}} material allocation mechanism and optimize the multistage forming process. In addition, approximate plane-strain analysis models have been given to provide formability predictions between single-stage and multistage strategies, and between strategies B and C, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the manufacturing process}} for wide chord fan blades (WCFB) and how the production of die sets used for their manufacture can be substantially improved using reverse engineering. Super plastic formed WCFBs are manufactured by diffusion bonding five separate blade pieces under high pressure. The blade is then hot creep formed into the required shape, using pressure to force the blade against the die walls to yield the desired form, blade twist and the honeycomb centre required. Two die sets are required, one for the hot creep forming of the blade billet and the second for the super plastic blade forming process. Their manufacture requires three solid models to be generated from a bespoke ‘Fan Key System’. This calculates the die set geometry required for both hot and cold states. The three solid models comprise the casting model geometry which incorporates the <b>draw</b> <b>angle</b> and shrinkage allowance, the pattern model for {{the top and bottom}} die sets and a die set model used to define the NC part programs for the five axis finish machining process. The machining process has three elements, pre-machining sometimes termed water line or terrace machining, semi-finish and finish machining. Distortion caused by rate of cooling, graphite precipitation and mould dilation cause massive amounts of metal removal in the waterline machining process which can take up to 35 h and is a non-value added process. It often leaves the die wall thin with the resulting effect on performance and life. A reverse engineering solution was used to improve the geometry of the castings by predicting die distortion more accurately. Point cloud models of nine casting sets were imported into reverse engineering software, ‘Surfacer’ which made possible a comparison with the surface geometry representation required. The resulting design information enabled more accurate die set design. Waterline machining had been substantially reduced and die life has been extende...|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} of en echelon mining-induced fractures seen in hard-rock mines provided {{a basis for}} inferring that fracture zones and bedding plane separations immediately surrounding mine openings are promoted by oblique shear into the openings. It is hypothesized that initial fractures or separations form {{at the corners of}} openings as a result of high stress and physical constraint on the rock's ability to deform elastically toward the opening. These conditions result in a locally preferred direction of shearing. The shearing, in turn, generates tensile stress that initiates a progression of systematically offset fractures approximately parallel to the direction of greatest compressive stress. The fractures or bedding separations create tabular rock layers that amplify shearing displacement through bending and dilation. Such shearing effectively reduces and redistributes the compressive stress, but significant dilation is an inevitable consequence. The combination of dilation and shearing and the progressive development of fracture zones have important implications with respect to ground support. The concept of mining-induced fractures forming as a result of shear is illustrated by two examples from coal mines. First, fractures seen at longwall faces probably result from shear associated with subsidence. The fracture zone that develops approximates or possibly defines the <b>draw</b> <b>angle</b> of subsidence. As the face advances, fractures extend downward along the lower edge of the fracture zone, while upper extensions of the fractures are pressed closed. Fracture zones in entry roofs provide a second practical example. Here, mining-induced fractures typically follow bedding planes. The shear zone model suggests that the first bedding separations develop near the edges of the roof and successive separations progress upward and toward the center. However, if the direction of greatest stress is inclined with respect to the roof, a fracture or bedding separation zone may propagate from one side only and also extend higher. Because coal ahead of the face provides some support against lateral shear deformation, bedding separation is inhibited near the face. Rock bolts installed close to the face ultimately become more strained and bent than bolts installed a few meters from the face, and bolts installed through the more remote part of a separation zone may ultimately experience the greatest tensile and bending strains. This model is supported by field data documenting progressive bolt failures that rapidly propagated downward across the roof during face advance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Incremental {{sheet metal}} forming is a new process to {{manufacture}} sheet metal parts and it is becoming a remarkable technology for fast prototyping and small lot production because {{of the advantages of}} this technology such as process flexibility, product independent tooling and higher formability. On the other hand, limited maximum <b>drawing</b> <b>angle,</b> relatively coarse surface roughness, low geometrical accuracy and long forming time are common disadvantages of the process. Furthermore, it is affected by process parameters which are tool diameter, forming velocity, spindle speed, forming geometry and depth, etc. Toolpath strategy which is used to form sheet metal by CNC machine has a key role among these parameters. The present study has been undertaken in order to investigate the suitable toolpath strategy which is developed for metal cutting by commercial CAD/CAM software to increase geometrical accuracy and decrease thinning and forming time. For the intended purpose, seven different toolpath strategies which are rough and finish strategies were used to form a truncated frustum by using one millimeter thick S 235 JR steel alloy. The effect of each strategy on the surface roughness, geometrical accuracy and thinning distribution of formed product was studied by measuring thickness, <b>drawing</b> <b>angle</b> and depth of formed parts. Therefore, formed parts scanned by 3 D laser scanner and STL files of parts were generated then STL files were converted into CAD file. CAD data of parts was used for measurements. The measurements showed that not only forming movements but also transition movements along the tool path affected the geometric accuracy and thinning distribution, surface roughness and forming time of formed parts. On the other hand it was observed that rough strategies were given good results as finish strategies and tool paths generated by CAM software need to be editing for better geometric accuracy, thinning, forming time and surface quality...|$|R
