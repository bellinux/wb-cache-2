5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
40|$|New Lagrangians, {{depending}} on the <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> and the electric and magnetic sources are found, which lead to the Maxwell equations. One new feature is that the equations of motion are obtained by varying the Lagrangian with respect to both the <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> and the sources. In this way, conserved currents can be found for the <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> and the electric or magnetic sources. Furthermore, using the equations of motion, the electric or magnetic sources can be eliminated, leading to conserved currents for the <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> only (in the presence of electric and magnetic sources). Another new feature is {{the construction of a}} Lagrangian invariant under the duality transformation for both <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> and electric and magnetic sources. The conserved current, after the elimination of electric and magnetic sources, depends on the <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> only. The conserved quantity is related to the total helicity of the electromagnetic field. Comment: 27 page...|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force.

The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E

Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers.

Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field.

These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere.

No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.

5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E

For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss or 30 μT (microTesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M 33, our Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5 μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent spiral arms the <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> can {{be up to}} 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated.

5|$|When flux tubes {{loaded with}} the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a {{reconnection}} process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma. The former returns to the inner magnetosphere {{in the form of}} flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of plasmoids—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days. The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere. The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.|$|E
