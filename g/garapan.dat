5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The main effects from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In <b>Garapan,</b> the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Garapan</b> {{was a minor}} {{settlement}} {{during the}} Spanish colonial period of Saipan, and a location to which the Chamorros forcibly relocated from other islands in the Northern Marianas were housed before being transferred to Guam. The forced transfer of the Chamorros to Guam was completed by 1749 and Saipan was recorded as uninhabited. The village name of <b>Garapan</b> derived from the Refaluwasch(Carolinian)name of Arabwal(Gharabwan), so named for the vine with heart-shaped leaves found along the beach there by a group from Satawal who arrived here to settle around the year 1815. Between the years 1865 and 1869, the Hispanicized descendents of the Chamorros that were forcibly relocated to Guam started a settlement in this area, although apart from the Refaluwasch (Carolinian) community. During the German colonial period (1898-1914) a road was built connecting <b>Garapan</b> with Tanapag. The village was selected by the Empire of Japan when Japan acquired the South Seas Mandate from the League of Nations in 1920 to be the capital of their holdings in the Mariana Islands. Under the Nan’yō Kōhatsu Kabushiki Kaisha, the town rapidly developed, with a school, hospital, courthouse, bank, newspaper offices, cinema, and numerous public buildings constructed. By the mid-1930s, <b>Garapan</b> had a population of approximately 14,000 people, mostly Japanese and ethnic Koreans, Taiwanese and Okinawans, and was nicknamed [...] "Tokyo of the South Seas".|$|E
