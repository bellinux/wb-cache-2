5|$|In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, {{her first}} movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim {{spinster}} missionary living in German East Africa at {{the outbreak of}} World War I. Costarring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming. Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released {{at the end of}} 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> that she could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; in the end <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> to be a failure.|$|E

5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be the}} turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E
5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be an}} artistic and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she {{made it clear to}} him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E

50|$|The {{difficulty}} with this reasoning {{is that if}} <b>it</b> <b>proves</b> anything, <b>it</b> <b>proves</b> too much.

60|$|So with officers. They {{should be}} {{appointed}} among the scholars, only {{as fast as}} they are actually needed, and the plan should thus be cautiously carried only so far as <b>it</b> <b>proves</b> good on trial.

Make no rash experiments on a large scale, but always test your principle in the small way, and then, if <b>it</b> <b>proves</b> good, gradually extend its operation, as circumstances seem to require.|$|R
5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards.

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> to be an early dawn for Arsenal, who {{spent most of the}} rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
