5|$|After {{crossing}} Center Street (Route 150) {{near the}} Wallingford train station, the road becomes North Colony Street and heads {{out of the}} town center. The road crosses Route 68 at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> about two miles (three km) later, followed {{by a series of}} junctions about half a mile (0.8km) apart each: an interchange with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (at exit 66), a split to the left where Route 71 begins and a merge from the left where Route 150 ends.|$|E
25|$|Other {{more distant}} {{aspirations}} include resignalling and capacity improvements at Reading; {{the provision of}} four continuous tracks between Didcot and Swindon (including a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> at Milton, where westbound relief line switches from {{the north side of}} the line to the south); and resignalling between Bath and Bristol to enable trains to run closer together.|$|E
25|$|Until 1996, {{there were}} firm {{plans for the}} bypass to be {{upgraded}} to motorway standard, since shelved. The Carpenter's Lodge roundabout south of the town has been replaced with a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction.</b> The old A16 road, now A1175 (Uffington Road), which heads to Market Deeping, meets {{the north end of}} the A43 (Wothorpe Road) in the south of the town.|$|E

50|$|Quadrupling, <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions,</b> and {{electrification}} all {{enhanced the}} efficiency of the service offered.|$|R
50|$|The route {{was first}} planned during the 1980s, as a trunk road {{to link the}} planned Black Country Route at Bilston with Junction 1 of the M5 {{motorway}} in West Bromwich, featuring <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions,</b> although these were abandoned by 1992 due to cost-cutting measures by the Conservative government, with conventional traffic islands taking {{the place of the}} <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> and part of the route diverted along an existing road instead of running along a new mile-long route.|$|R
25|$|The M90 will be {{extended}} west {{from the current}} bridge access at Ferry Muir, wrapping around South Queensferry to the southern landfall of the new crossing. A <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> will be built on the A904 just west of Echline, at the south-west edge. The existing access from the Forth Road Bridge to the A90 will remain open to public transport. South Queensferry Junction will become Junction 1A of the M90 when the Queensferry Crossing opens.|$|E
25|$|Operation of the {{complete}} subway to the planned terminal at Penn Station was delayed until the new Pennsylvania Railroad station above was completed in 1937. The terminal has five tracks, two incoming and three outgoing, connected by two loop tracks. This part of the subway included a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> with {{a connection to the}} lower level of the Newark Public Service Terminal that was used for only a few months (June to September).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{roundabout}} at Streatley, {{where the}} road becomes the dual-carriageway Luton Road, passing through the Bartonhill Cutting. The road becomes single carriageway at the roundabout with the B655 {{at the other end}} of the Barton-le-Clay bypass. It meets the A507 at a roundabout at Clophill, crossing the River Flit. It passes by Maulden Wood as the dual-carriage up Deadman's Hill then passes Haynes West End. It enters the district of Bedford and bypasses Wilstead. It meets the A421 at the Elstow Interchange <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> (GSJ). The A6 meets the A5134 at a large signal-controlled junction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> connect {{each end}} of the {{northbound}} track with the main line. All stations are long enough to accept two, three-car (20m) EMUs.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} city centre ring roads, Coventry ring road {{is made up}} of entirely <b>grade-separated</b> <b>{{junctions}}</b> except for one roundabout, this leads to the junctions being extremely close together and in effect one junction leads into another at many points.|$|R
2500|$|A dual {{carriageway}} with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> and which meets other requirements may be upgraded to motorway standard, denoted by an (M) added after the road number (e.g. [...] "A1(M)" [...] or [...] "A38(M)"). Unlike in Ireland, {{there was no}} official terminology for 'high-quality {{dual carriageway}}s' until April 2015, when in England a new standard was set to designate certain high-quality routes formally as [...] "Expressways". Many roads such as the A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions,</b> full barriers at roadside and central reservations and, in some cases, three lanes of traffic. They may still fall short of motorway standard in terms of hard shoulders, the height of overpasses or the quality of intersecting junctions.|$|R
25|$|East of Earl's Court {{there is}} a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> off the main line to the Edgware Road branch. This follows the Circle line after High Street Kensington station where there are also two bay {{platforms}} for the District line. After Paddington station this branch joins the Hammersmith & City line at Praed Street junction, before terminating at the four-platform Edgware Road. The main line joins the Circle line at Gloucester Road and the line and stations are in cut-and-cover tunnels, meeting the Thames at Westminster station, after which the railway is in the Victoria Embankment on the north bank of the river. At Tower Hill station, {{there is a}} bay platform.|$|E
25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London. An overhead conductor rail replaced the traditional Mk3b solid wire between the former King's Cross Thameslink station to St Pancras International station.|$|E
25|$|North of Fürth, the S-Bahn to Eltersdorf {{branches}} off {{the existing}} line. There, the existing line, the S-Bahn {{and the new}} line to Nuremberg freight yard will meet at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction.</b> Between Fürth Hbf and Eltersdorf, the line will therefore have two tracks, with a third track in Vach station. From Eltersdorf, the existing line towards Erlangen/Bamberg will be supplemented to its east with two more tracks that can be operated at up to 230km/h. The line between Großgründlach and Bamberg will also be upgraded to four-tracks. The Nuremberg S-Bahn and freight traffic would use the two middle tracks. The planned two tunnels of the extension would have a total length of eight kilometres and there would also be two new viaducts with a total length of 400metres.|$|E
50|$|The road is for {{the most}} part {{circular}} although forming a chevron pointing southwards as it merges into the A426 and A5199, Aylestone and Welford Roads. Its proflie is largely dual carriageway urban clear route. There are <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> at the A607 (flyover/overpass) to the north and at the A47 (underpass) to the west.|$|R
30|$|Elvik et al. [19] {{found no}} {{studies that show}} effects of <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> on {{environmental}} conditions. However, the authors indicate that grade-separated interchanges require more space than at-grade intersections. Ramps and bridges can appear dominant in the landscape and spoil the view for people living along the road. Because of more constant speed, fuel consumption may be reduced.|$|R
50|$|Between August 2006 and September 2009 six roundabouts on the A1 and the A1(M) to Alconbury were {{replaced}} with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions.</b> These provide a fully grade-separated route between the Buckden roundabout (just north of St Neots and approximately 8 mi {{north of the}} Black Cat Roundabout) and just north of Morpeth. This project cost £96 million.|$|R
25|$|On {{the main}} line, there are {{cross-platform}} interchanges at Acton Town, Hammersmith and Barons Court stations, {{after which the}} Piccadilly line tracks descend into tunnels, while the District line becomes two tracks through West Kensington station. Before the line enters Earl's Court station, the short Kensington (Olympia) branch joins at a flat junction and the Wimbledon branch at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction.</b> On the Wimbledon branch, the District line at Wimbledon station is west of the South Western Main Line platforms, then the two-track line has a junction at East Putney station with the Hounslow Loop Line, before passing over the River Thames on Fulham Railway Bridge; the line continues by passing under the West London Railway and coming alongside it at West Brompton station before the junction with the main line and the four-platform Earl's Court station.|$|E
25|$|At Stratford new {{platforms}} {{have been}} built for the North London Line at {{the northern end of}} the station. The old platforms (formerly 1 and 2) adjacent to the Jubilee line have been rebuilt for the DLR, renumbered 16 (towards Stratford International) and 17 (towards Beckton/Woolwich Arsenal). Interchange between the Stratford International branch and DLR trains via Poplar is possible although the platforms are widely separated and at different levels. There is no physical connection between the two branches. As part of the Transport & Works Act (TWA) application, Royal Victoria on the Beckton branch has been be extended to accommodate three-car trains, with a siding to enable trains to reverse there, using land released by the closure of the parallel North London Line. A partly <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> has been built south of Canning Town to prevent conflicting movements between the Bank branch and the Stratford International branch to and from the Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal branches.|$|E
500|$|Past I-196, M-11 curves to run east–west {{and becomes}} 28th Street. Wilson {{continues}} southwards {{as a local}} road and 28th Street is the route through Grandville and Wyoming. Chicago Drive runs under 28th Street in Grandville; there is a ramp from eastbound Chicago Drive to eastbound 28th Street, but all other connections are through the [...] "28th Street Cutoff" [...] {{to the east of}} the <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction.</b> Continuing eastward through Wyoming, M-11 passes through that city's central business district. The highway intersects US Highway 131 and crosses into Grand Rapids at Division Avenue. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, 28th Street passes the Indian Hills Golf Course. From Breton Avenue eastward, 28th Street is dominated by retail establishments as it continues into Kentwood. M-11 meets an intersection with East Beltline Avenue near the Woodland Mall. East Beltline carries M-37 through {{the eastern side of the}} Grand Rapids metro area, and M-44 north of 28th Street. [...] M-11 continues eastward to its terminus at exit44 on I-96 while 28th Street continues farther east to Cascade Road.|$|E
2500|$|The M27 {{was meant}} to be {{extended}} to Chichester; a sign of this is the width of the A27 road between Junction 12 and the junction with the A3(M), which has 3/4 lanes, a hard shoulder and <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions.</b> [...] It {{is not part of the}} M27 as its hard shoulders are not quite wide enough to comply with motorway regulations.|$|R
50|$|Conversion of the N-620 to autovía {{standard}} {{began in}} the mid-1980s, when the section between Palencia and Valladolid was upgraded to dual carriageway with same-level junctions. During the 1990s, the Burgos - Palencia and Valladolid - Salamanca sections were upgraded in a similar manner, but with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> and slip roads; the junctions on the Palencia - Valladolid section were improved accordingly at a similar time.|$|R
50|$|The road {{is mainly}} newly constructed, being built to {{regenerate}} the former coal-mining areas of Barnsley {{in the late}} 1990s. It has many at-grade roundabouts, and no <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions.</b> It {{is not so much}} a through-route, but for local access. A lot of the road, often at junctions, looks half-finished. Most of it looks like a spine access road on a typical industrial estate.|$|R
2500|$|Provision of a £47m <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> to {{the north}} of [...] (the Hitchin flyover) {{enabling}} down Cambridge trains to cross the main line The work was completed by 26 June 2013 ...|$|E
2500|$|The east of Docklands needed better {{transport}} {{connections to}} encourage development, {{and a fourth}} branch, towards Beckton, was planned, with several route options available. A route from [...] via [...] and {{the north side of}} the Royal Docks complex was chosen, and opened in 1994. Initially it was thought the line was likely to be underutilised, due to the sparse development in the area. As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced by a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> west of Poplar. Poplar was rebuilt to give cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines, with a new <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> built east of the station at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines.|$|E
2500|$|Between Wembley Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill the Metropolitan is four-track, with {{fast and}} slow lines paired by direction, {{paralleling}} the two-track un-electrified Chiltern Main Line. The slow lines are between the fast lines, {{and the two}} intermediate stations have island platforms. Harrow-on-the-Hill has platforms on all six lines. The [...] central slow lines diverge here at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> to become the [...] Uxbridge branch. After West Harrow, at Rayners Lane the line is joined by the Piccadilly line, which shares the tracks to Uxbridge; a turnback siding allows some Piccadilly line services to terminate at Rayners Lane.|$|E
50|$|Standard motorways: 52,000 {{vehicles}} AADT - {{annual average}} daily traffic. The road type is all-purpose dual carriageway (D2AP), {{but with the}} same specifications as motorway: a carriageway width of 7 metres (23 ft) and a hard shoulder of 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) width. HQDCs are limited access (<b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> only) and not intended to have junctions with minor roads. Junctions with major roads are grade-separated and to motorway standards.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{terminal}} junctions, motorways {{can only}} be accessed using <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions.</b> These typically {{take the form of}} roundabout interchanges for higher-capacity junctions, or dumbbell interchanges - which are a variant on the diamond-style interchange. - for lower-trafficked interchanges. A number of other types of junction are also used on the motorway network. The M4/M6 and M7/M9 junctions use a variant of the trumpet-style interchange while the M50/N7 and M50/N4 interchanges use partial cloverleaf junctions.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, the Ministry of Transport {{published}} The Highway Development Survey by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Charles Bressey, which reviewed London's road {{needs and}} recommended {{the construction of}} many miles of roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points. Among the proposals {{was a series of}} orbital roads around the city with the outer ones built as American-style parkways - wide, landscaped roads with limited access and <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Turning right (that is, {{across the}} line of traffic heading in the {{opposite}} direction) is usually permitted only at specific locations. Often the driver {{will be required to}} turn left (away from the dual carriageway) in order to loop around to an access road that permits crossing the major road. Roundabouts on dual carriageways are relatively common, especially in cities or where the cost of a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> would be prohibitive. [...] Where space is even more limited, intersections may be controlled by traffic lights. Smaller residential roads adjoining urban dual carriageways may be blocked off at one end {{to limit the number of}} junctions on the dual carriageway; often other roads will pass over or under the dual carriageway without an intersection.|$|E
2500|$|The Metropolitan line is [...] {{long and}} serves 34 stations. It is {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: a central conductor rail is energised at–210V and a rail outside the running rail at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V. The first [...] from Aldgate are below ground, {{shared with the}} Circle and Hammersmith & City lines to Baker Street, where the line diverges, remaining in tunnel until Finchley Road. Between Finchley Road and Wembley Park the line runs parallel to the Jubilee line, the tracks being paired by direction, with cross-platform interchange at the two stations. At Wembley Park the Jubilee line diverges to the Stanmore branch at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction.</b> From just after Finchley Road these four tracks run parallel with the Network Rail Chiltern Main Line from Marylebone.|$|E
2500|$|NY434 {{remains a}} four-lane divided highway {{for its first}} [...] in the city, {{following}} the Susquehanna River along the north edge of a vast neighborhood that comprises the south half of Binghamton. It soon approaches the vicinity of downtown Binghamton, where the route connects to Pennsylvania Avenue by way of an interchange located {{across the river from}} the city's center. Another <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junction</b> with Conklin Avenue follows, at which point NY434 turns northward and crosses the river into downtown as State Street. On the north bank of the river, NY434 meets NY363, a freeway linking downtown to the Southern Tier Expressway north of the city. NY434 continues on, narrowing to four undivided lanes for its final two blocks as it passes the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena and ends at a junction with US11 (Court Street).|$|E
50|$|Major modern {{highways}} {{that connect}} cities in populous {{developed and developing}} countries usually incorporate features intended to enhance the road's capacity, efficiency, and safety to various degrees. Such features include {{a reduction in the}} number of locations for user access, the use of dual carriageways with two or more lanes on each carriageway, and <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions</b> with other roads and modes of transport. These features are typically present on highways built as motorways (freeways).|$|R
25|$|Traffic {{lights and}} {{junctions}} are permitted at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this {{has resulted in}} fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with <b>grade-separated</b> <b>junctions,</b> but may not be designated as motorways due {{to the need to}} preserve access to adjoining property or to the absence of a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified {{do not need to be}} equipped with emergency phones.|$|R
50|$|In May 1938, Sir Charles Bressey and Sir Edwin Lutyens {{published}} a Ministry of Transport report, The Highway Development Survey, 1937, which reviewed London's road needs and recommended {{the construction of}} many miles of new roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points.
