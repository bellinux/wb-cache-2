30|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the voltage transitory of constant-current Er doping of PSi samples is tightly related to the final doping level. From {{the shape of the}} transitory, it is possible to anticipate the effectiveness of the doping process: a qualitative correlation of the final Er content with the transitory shape has been evidenced. This work therefore shows that a good understanding and control of the initial steps of the Er doping process is a key to the optimization of the whole process itself. Although it is presently too early to determine which are the best Er-doping conditions for porous silicon, we {{demonstrate that}} the result of the doping process depends on the parameter settings and that the current intensity is a relevant <b>doping</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this {{computational}} study, {{the band}} gap energy of an acceptordonor type conducting polymer consisting of terthiophene repeating units with a fused bisfulleroid group was estimated by extrapolating excitation energies approximated by the HOMO-LUMO energy differences {{as well as}} the TDDFT method with respect to the inverse number of monomer units. Optimizations were performed both in vacuum and in o-dichlorobenzene (as solvent) using the B 3 LYP and MPW 1 B 95 functionals. The calculated optical band gap was found to be in good agreement with experimentally reported band gaps in the literature. However, different band gaps with different experimental techniques were reported in the referred experimental study for the same system. To understand the reasons behind this behavior, effects of the structural (inter- and intramolecular stacking) and environmental (explicit and implicit solvation and acidic <b>doping)</b> <b>factors</b> on the absorption of the terthiophene monomer with fused bisfulleroid were investigated.

40|$|Team {{sports are}} rarely studied {{with regard to}} doping {{behaviour}} and doping-related factors regardless of their global popularity. This study aimed to investigate <b>doping</b> <b>factors</b> and covariates of potential doping behaviour in high-level team-sport athletes. The subjects were 457 high-performing, national- and international-level athletes (21. 9 ± 3. 4 years of age; 179 females) involved in volleyball (n = 77), soccer (n = 163), basketball (n = 114) and handball (n = 103). Previously validated self-administered questionnaires aimed at evidencing sport factors, doping-related factors, knowledge on sport nutrition and doping, and attitudes to performance enhancement were used. The results indicated a higher doping likelihood in male athletes, with a significant gender difference for basketball and handball. In males, a higher doping likelihood is found for athletes who had achieved better results at junior-age level, those who regularly consume dietary supplements, and who perceive their sport as being contaminated by doping. A higher sport achievement at senior-age level is protective against potential doping behaviour in males. In females, a higher likelihood of doping is evidenced in those athletes involved in binge drinking, while a lower tendency for doping is evidenced in female athletes who possess better knowledge on sport nutrition. Knowledge about doping is very low and thus education about doping is urgently needed. An improvement of knowledge on sport nutrition might be a potentially effective method for reducing the tendency for doping in females. Future studies should consider other approaches and theories, such as theory of planned behaviour and/or social-cognitive theory, in studying the problem of doping behaviour in team-sports...|$|R
40|$|Solar cells {{made from}} gallium {{arsenide}} (Gaas), with a room temperature bandgap of E(sub g) = 1. 43 eV have exhibited the best measured {{open circuit voltage}} (V sub oc) of 1. 05 V at 1 AM 0, 25 C. The material InP {{is in many ways}} similar to GaAs. A simple calculation comparing InP to GaAs then shows that solar cells made from InP, with E(sub g) = 1. 35 at 300 K, should exhibit the best measured V sub oc of approximately 950 mV at 1 AM 0, 300 K. However, to date, the best measured V sub oc for InP solar cells made by any fabrication method is 899 mV at AM 1. 5, 25 C which would translate to 912 mV at 1 AM 0, 25 C. The V sub oc of an n(+) pp(+) InP solar cell is governed by several factors. Of these, some factors, such as the thickness and doping of the emitter and base regions, are easily controlled and can be adjusted to desired values dictated by a good performance optimizing model. Such factors were not considered. There are other factors which also govern V sub oc, and their values are not so easily controlled. The primary ones among these are (1) the indirect or Hall-Shockley-Read lifetimes in the various regions of the cell, (2) the low-doping intrinsic carrier concentration n(sub i) of the InP material, (3) the heavy <b>doping</b> <b>factors</b> in the emitter and BSF regions, and (4) the front surface recombination velocity S(sub F).

40|$|Conducted {{researches}} recognize various risk factors, {{as well as}} protective <b>factors</b> against <b>doping</b> behaviour {{in different}} sports i. e. sports disciplines or activities. The main goal {{of this research was}} to identify the correlation between selected socio-demographic, health-related, and sports-related predictors with <b>doping</b> <b>factors</b> in three different types of sports, which are (1) highly energetic demanding sports (weightlifting), (2) highly technical demanding sports (racquet sports), and (3) highly tactical demanding sports (sailing). The research consisted of three separate studies, each one of them researching one of the sports. The sample of subjects included altogether 293 athletes, senior level competitors (older than 18 years of age). In total, the sample comprised three homogenous sub-samples, as follows: athletes in highly energetic demanding sports (weightlifters and power lifters; N= 27), athletes in highly technical demanding sports (table tennis, tennis and badminton players; N= 188), and athletes in highly tactical demanding sports (sailing; N= 78). The first study involved weightlifters where we should point out the existence of high doping behaviour. In this study, religiousness was interpreted as the most significant protective <b>factor</b> against <b>doping</b> behaviour, while sports factors are not found to be significantly related to doping. The study involving racquet sport athletes suggests a high risk of doping behaviour among those athletes who observe doping behaviour in their sport. We noticed low levels of athletes’ trust in their coaches’ and physicians’ opinions on doping issues. This is an issue which should be researched in the future, because the underlying cause has not been studied as yet. Briefly, it seems that either the athletes are not convinced of their coaches’/physicians’ expertise regarding doping issues, and/or they do not believe in their good intentions. It is particularly important, as the previous research has shown that with the increased trust in coaches and physicians, the chance that an athlete will use doping decreases. As expected, it is characteristic for sailing that it has a low likelihood of potential doping behaviour, although the consumption of dietary supplements is high. Substance abuse in sports spreads beyond those that enhance athletic performance. All of these issues should be studied in more detail in the future and, if appropriately validated, incorporated into anti-doping intervention programs...|$|R

The modified HNTs; S-HNTs were prepared by treating HNTs with N-ß-(aminoethyl) -?-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane (AEAPTMS).

In the second part, the influence of silane concentration on the fabricated MMMs was studied.

In the last part, the effect of S-HNTs loading was experienced. Our observations showed that the dispersion of nanoparticles decreased with an increase in the S-HNTs loading. Accordingly, 0. 5 % loading of silylated-HNT yielded the optimum MMMs in terms of permeability (27 % increase) and selectivity (8 % increase) ...|$|R

40|$|The apatite-type phases, La 9. 33 +x(Si/Ge) (6) O 26 + 3 x/ 2, have {{recently}} been attracting considerable interest as potential electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells. In this paper we report results {{from a range of}} doping studies in the Si based systems, aimed at determining the key features required for the optimisation of the conductivities. Systems examined have included alkaline earth doping on the rare earth site, and P, B, Ga, V doping on the Si site. By suitable <b>doping</b> strategies, <b>factors</b> such as the level of cation vacancies and oxygen excess have been investigated. The results show that the oxide ion conductivities of these apatite systems are maximised by the incorporation of either oxygen excess or cation vacancies, with the former producing the best oxide ion conductors. In terms of samples containing cation vacancies, conductivities are enhanced by doping lower valent ions, Ga, B, on the Si site. The presence of higher valent ions on these sites, e. g P, appears to inhibit the incorporation of excess oxygen within the channels, and so limits the maximum conductivity that can be obtained. Overall the results suggest that the tetrahedral sites {{play a key role in}} the conduction properties of these materials, supporting recent modelling studies, which have suggested that these tetrahedra aid in the motion of the oxide ions down the conduction channels by co-operative displacements...|$|R

Purposive sampling was used to gather 118 webpages of doping-related discussion, which were qualitatively analysed using grounded theory applying Strauss's coding paradigm. Inductive categories were integrated into a motivational framework that related recreational doping to social validation. Categories included the online community's rite of passage, normative-inferences that facilitated <b>doping,</b> and deterrence <b>factors</b> related to fear of perceived health risks.

The calculation dif-fers in that conductivities within granules are summarized, while total resistance of the system is represented as a sum of resistances of the granules. In addition, the existence of AFM interaction between granules is supported by the observed insensitivity of conductivity to a low external magnetic field (up to 5 kOe) ...|$|R
40|$|A self doping contact {{consisting}} of a silver/antimony alloy that produces an Ohmic contact to moderately doped n-type germanium (<b>doped</b> to a <b>factor</b> of four above the metal-insulator transition) has been investigated. An evaporation of a mixed alloy of Ag/Sb (99 %/ 1 %) onto n-Ge (ND= 1 × 1018 cm− 3) annealed at 400 [*]°C produces an Ohmic contact with a measured specific contact resistivity of (1. 1 ± 0. 2) × 10 − 5 Ω-cm 2. It is proposed that the Ohmic behaviour arises from an increased doping concentration at the Ge surface due to the preferential evaporation of Sb confirmed by transmission electron microscope analysis. It is suggested that the doping concentration has increased to a level where field emission will be the dominate conduction mechanism. This was deduced from the low temperature electrical characterisation of the contact, which exhibits Ohmic behaviour down to a temperature of 6. 5 [*]K...|$|R

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of TCO films as electrodes in solar cell devices. Among the TCO films, the most appropriate material for the application seems to be tin oxide films, which are chemically inert, mechanically hard, and heat resistant. In addition, they exhibit low electrical resistivity and high optical transmittance. Either doped or non-doped, tin oxide thin films can be fabricated by a number of techniques: chemical vapor deposition[1], sputtering[2], sol-gel coating[3], and spray pyrolysis[4, 5, 6]. The sol-gel method has such advantages as cheap cost and flexible deposition technique. Such properties can be improved by doping tin oxide with, for example, antimony (Sb), indium (In), or fluorine (F). In fact, by increasing the doping concentration (> 2 %), a degenerate semiconductor is formed, displaying higher σ values (> 103 Ω− 1 cm− 1). Since this doping level is not too high, doped SnO 2 thin films are transparent for visible light, which makes them useful for a device application point of view.

The alloys processing is kept simple-vacuum arc melting only to make a dense alloy for characterization. This also results in retaining the as-solidified highly layered structure. The alloys are found to have two polymorphic forms: hexagonal and orthorhombic at room temperature with a superstructure. The fractured surface shows clearly the layered structure with similar to 300 nm thick platelet like features stacked together to form large defect free grains. The electrical conductivity increases to similar to 7 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) due to Ni-doping compared to similar to 5 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) for the undoped alloy at room temperature. This however decreases to similar to 2. 5 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) due to double doping, i. e., Ni and Se. In both cases, the alloys exhibit a weak metallic behavior with the conductivity decreasing with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient however increases with temperature and with double doping resulting in the highest Seebeck coefficient, which increases from 40 mu VK- 1 to 110 mu VK- 1 when the temperature varies from 300 K to 1000 K. The hole carrier concentration in the two alloys, Ni-doped and double doped, {{is found to be}} nearly identical, 7 x 10 (20) cm(- 3) and 8. 52 x 10 (20) cm(- 3), respectively, while the mobility of carriers decreased by 5 times from 283 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) to 52 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) due to double <b>doping.</b> These <b>factors</b> together with multiple scale phonon scattering resulted in the double doped alloy having the lowest thermal conductivity in the range of 1 - 2 Wm(- 1) K- 1 in the complete temperature range.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the growing}} body of {{literature}} and putative links {{between the use of}} ergogenic nutritional supplements, doping and illicit drugs, it remains unclear whether, in athletes' minds, doping aligns with illicit behaviour or with functional use of chemical or natural preparations. To date, no attempt has been made to quantitatively explore athletes' mental representation of doping in relation to illegality and functionality. Methods A convenience sample of student athletes from a large South-Eastern Australian university responded to an on-line survey. Competitive athletes (n = 46) were grouped based on self-reported use as follows: i) none used (30 %), ii) supplement only (22 %), iii) illicit only (26 %) and iv) both supplements and illicit drug use (22 %). Whereas no athlete reported doping, data provided on projected supplement-, doping- and drug use by the four user groups allowed evaluation of doping-related cognition in the context of self-reported supplement- and illicit drug taking behaviour; and comparison between these substances. Results A significantly higher prevalence estimation was found for illicit drug use and a trend towards a biased social projection emerged for supplement use. Doping estimates by user groups showed mixed results, suggesting that doping had more in common with the ergogenic nutritional supplement domain than the illicit drug domain. Conclusions Assessing the behavioural domain to which doping belongs to in athletes' mind would greatly advance doping behaviour research toward prevention and intervention. Further investigation refining the peculiarity of the mental representation of doping with a larger study sample, controlling for knowledge of <b>doping</b> and other <b>factors,</b> is warranted. </p...|$|R
