25|$|Full-Flow Filtration — Full-flow {{filtration}} continuously strains particulates out of {{the entire}} system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min.

While this is the ideal method of filtration, for <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> systems it may be cost-prohibitive.|$|E

50|$|A {{compound}} meter is used where <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> {{rates are}} necessary, but where at times {{there are also}} smaller rates of flow {{that need to be}} accurately measured. Compound meters have two measuring elements and a check valve to regulate flow between them. At <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> rates, water is normally diverted primarily or completely to the <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> element. The <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> element is typically a turbine meter. When flow rates drop to where the <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> element cannot measure accurately, a check valve closes to divert water to a smaller element that can measure the lower flow rates accurately. The low flow element is typically a multi-jet or PD meter. By adding the values registered by the high and low elements, the utility has a record of the total consumption of water flowing through the meter.|$|R
25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E
25|$|The fastest {{reactions}} {{tend to be}} in {{the order}} of triple-bonded > double-bonded > single bonded molecules, and also lower molecular weight molecules are faster than higher ones. So acetylene is faster than ethylene, and ethylene is faster than propene, etc. The molecular weight factor in polymer deposition is dependent on the monomer flow rate, in which a higher molecular weight monomer typically near 200 g/mol needs a much <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 15 g/cm2, whereas lower molecular weights around 50 g/mol require a flow rate of only 5 g/cm2. A heavy monomer therefore needs a faster flow, and would likely lead to increased pressures, decreasing polymerization rates.|$|E
500|$|The {{desirable}} rate of shielding-gas flow depends {{primarily on}} weld geometry, speed, current, {{the type of}} gas, and the metal transfer mode. Welding flat surfaces requires <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> than welding grooved materials, since gas disperses more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirementsfor the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes, about 10L/min (20ft³/h) is generally suitable, whereas for globular transfer, around 15L/min (30ft³/h) is preferred. [...] The spray transfer variation normally requires more shielding-gas flow because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool. Typical gas-flow amounts are approximately 2025L/min (4050ft³/h).|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Delivery of warmed, humidified air via nasal <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> therapy could {{potentially}} reduce replication of temperature-sensitive viruses {{in the upper}} respiratory tract. This study investigates whether nasal <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> therapy is well tolerated by healthy adults at 37 °C and 41 °C. Methods. In this randomised, double-blind, controlled crossover pilot trial, nasal <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> therapy was used to deliver humidified air at 35 [*]L/min, at either 37 °C or 41 °C, for three one-hour sessions of use over one day. The alternative was delivered at least 14 days later. Ten healthy, nonsmoking adults were asked, via questionnaire after each day’s use, whether they would use nasal <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> therapy while being unwell with a cold or flu if it was demonstrated to improve symptoms. Results. All participants completed both interventions. Eighty percent responded “yes” to future use of nasal <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> therapy, for both 37 °C and 41 °C.

500|$|The pigeye shark inhabits {{coastal waters}} {{down to a}} depth of , favouring environments with fine {{sediment}} and murky water. It sometimes enters estuaries, but unlike the bull shark, it does not ascend rivers and avoids brackish water. The movements and habitat usage of juvenile pigeye sharks have been extensively studied in Cleveland Bay in northeastern Queensland. Young sharks live in the bay year-round, staying mostly in the eastern side where the input from three rivers produces strong currents and high turbidity. Individual home ranges are relatively small, averaging , and increase in size with age. The juveniles generally stay in water less than [...] deep, with the youngest sharks spending the most time in the shallowest parts of the bay. They swim into the intertidal zone with the rising tide and depart as the tide recedes; this movement may relate to exploiting foraging opportunities on the submerged mud flats, or to avoiding predation or competition by staying out of the deeper waters occupied by larger sharks. There is also an annual movement cycle where the juveniles move closer to the river mouths during the dry season and farther from them during the wet season; since the rainy season brings a <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> of fresh water into the bay, the sharks may be responding directly or indirectly to the resultant decrease in salinity and dissolved oxygen levels.|$|E

Design: Cluster randomised controlled parallel group trial. Setting: Ambulance service in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Participants: 405 patients with a presumed acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were treated by paramedics, transported, and admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital during the trial period; 214 had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease confirmed by lung function tests in the previous five years. Interventions: <b>High</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen treatment compared with titrated oxygen treatment in the prehospital (ambulance/paramedic) setting. Main outcome measure: Prehospital or in-hospital mortality. Results: In an intention to treat analysis, the risk of death was significantly lower in the titrated oxygen arm compared with the <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen arm for all patients (<b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen n= 226; titrated oxygen n= 179) and for the subgroup of patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<b>high</b> <b>flow</b> n= 117; titrated n= 97). Overall mortality was 9 % (21 deaths) in the <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen arm compared with 4 % (7 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm; mortality in the subgroup with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 9 % (11 deaths) in the <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> arm compared with 2 % (2 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm. Titrated oxygen treatment reduced mortality compared with <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen by 58 % for all patients (relative risk 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval 0. 20 to 0. 89; P= 0. 02) and by 78 % for the patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0. 22, 0. 05 to 0. 91; P= 0. 04). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received titrated oxygen according to the protocol were significantly less likely to have respiratory acidosis (mean difference in pH 0. 12 (SE 0. 05); P= 0. 01; n= 28) or hypercapnia (mean difference in arterial carbon dioxide pressure − 33. 6 (16. 3) mm Hg; P= 0. 02; n= 29) than were patients who received <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen. Conclusions: Titrated oxygen treatment significantly reduced mortality, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis compared with <b>high</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These results provide strong evidence to recommend the routine use of titrated oxygen treatment in patients with breathlessness and a history or clinical likelihood of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the prehospital setting...|$|R

The Komatsu analysis does not evaluate the impact of the considerable erosion observed in this basin during the flood (or floods) – hence the assumption that the flood hydraulics can be modeled using modern-day topography is an area which warrants further consideration – earlier narrower constrictions at places such as Wallula Gap and through the Columbia Gorge could be expected to produce <b>higher</b> <b>flow</b> resistance and correspondingly higher floods.|$|E
