5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle <b>fasciculations</b> and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without <b>fasciculations</b> or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

25|$|Tics {{must also}} be {{distinguished}} from <b>fasciculations.</b> Small twitches of the upper or lower eyelid, for example, are not tics, {{because they do not}} involve a whole muscle. They are twitches of a few muscle fibre bundles, which can be felt but barely seen.|$|E
25|$|Multifocal motor {{neuropathy}} (MMN) {{is a rare}} clinical case, characterized {{almost entirely}} by muscle weakness, atrophy, and <b>fasciculations.</b> An important feature of MMN is that the strength-duration constant is significantly small, corresponding to an appreciable increase in rheobase.

25|$|These toxins attack {{cholinergic}} neurons (those {{that use}} ACh as a transmitter) by destroying acetylcholinesterase (AChE).

40|$|Introduction: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant, {{which has}} been used {{extensively}} in anesthesia to produce muscle relaxation. The present study {{was done with the}} aim of comparing <b>Fasciculation</b> and postoperative myalgia after injection of two different doses of Succinylcholine (1. 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg). Materials and Methods: In this study {{which has been}} conducted in the form of Randomized double blind study in Tehran Shariati Hospital in the year 2000, 50 male patients in two groups (25 in each) with ASA I&II, age between 18 to 65, were candidate for an elective surgical repair of inguinal hernia received a standard anesthetic technique, including one of the two doses of Succinylcholine. Results: After collecting data it has been considered that the average difference of two respective groups is meaningful in terms of <b>fasciculation</b> (P 0. 05). Conclusion: we came to the conclusion that, firstly, the percentage of myalgia after the injection of succinylcholine is totally low and with the increase of the dose of medication from 1. 5 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg the very percentage does not change considerably. Secondly, regarding <b>fasciculation</b> the increase of the dose of medication from 1. 5 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg causes the decrease of the average limit of <b>fasciculation.</b> This decrease is very obvious in server <b>fasciculation.</b> As a matter of fact no relationship was found between decrease in <b>fasciculation</b> and change in myalgia...|$|R
25|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) affects {{upper and}} lower motor systems, with symptoms ranging from muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, and <b>fasciculations,</b> all of which suggest increased axonal excitability. Many studies have concluded that abnormally decreased K+ conductance results in axonal depolarization, leading to axonal hyperexcitability and the generation of fasciculation. ALS patients in these studies demonstrated longer strength-duration time constants and lower values for rheobase than in control subjects.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} and atrophy are inevitable consequences of α-MN lesions as well. Because muscle {{size and strength}} {{are related to the}} extent of their use, denervated muscles are prone to atrophy. A secondary cause of muscle atrophy is that denervated muscles are no longer supplied with trophic factors from the α-MNs that innervate them. Alpha motor neuron lesions also result in abnormal EMG potentials (e.g., fibrillation potentials) and <b>fasciculations,</b> the latter being spontaneous, involuntary muscle contractions.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (<b>fasciculations)</b> although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAxon <b>fasciculation</b> {{is one of}} the {{processes}} controlling topographic innervation during embryonic development. While axon guidance steers extending axons in the accurate direction, axon <b>fasciculation</b> allows sets of co-extending axons to grow in tight bundles. The Eph:ephrin family has been involved both in axon guidance and <b>fasciculation,</b> yet it remains unclear how these two distinct types of responses are elicited. Herein we have characterized the role of ephrin-B 1, a member of the ephrinB family in sensory and motor innervation of the limb. We show that ephrin-B 1 is expressed in sensory axons and in the limb bud mesenchyme while EphB 2 is expressed in motor and sensory axons. Loss of ephrin-B 1 had no impact on the accurate dorso-ventral innervation of the limb by motor axons, yet EfnB 1 mutants exhibited decreased <b>fasciculation</b> of peripheral motor and sensory nerves. Using tissue-specific excision of EfnB 1 and in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that ephrin-B 1 controls <b>fasciculation</b> of axons via a surround repulsion mechanism involving growth cone collapse of EphB 2 -expressing axons. Altogether, our results highlight the complex role of Eph:ephrin signaling {{in the development of the}} sensory-motor circuit innervating the limb...|$|R

[...] When the nerve is damaged, the tongue may feel [...] "thick", [...] "heavy", or [...] "clumsy." [...] Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek.|$|E

Since NILE seems to be concentrated on neurites, we have investigated its possible {{role in the development of}} neurites in primary cultures of rat brain. Cultures of embryonic day 14 (E 14) whole brain and cultures of postnatal day 5 (P 5) cerebellum were grown in the presence of Fab' fragments of antibody against NILE in an attempt to perturb the normal pattern of neurite development. For comparison, cultures were treated with two other reagents that recognize neuronal cell surface molecules: tetanus toxin, which binds to the GD 1 b and GT 1 gangliosides, and Fab' fragments of antibody against neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). Under the conditions used, none of the exogenous reagents affected neurite outgrowth, but specific effects on neurite <b>fasciculation</b> were observed. Anti-NILE inhibited <b>fasciculation</b> in cultures of E 14 whole brain but had no effect on <b>fasciculation</b> in cultures of P 5 cerebellum. Conversely, anti-N-CAM inhibited <b>fasciculation</b> in cultures of P 5 cerebellum, which contain the adult form of N-CAM, but had little effect on <b>fasciculation</b> in cultures of E 14 whole brain, which contain the embryonic form of N-CAM. Tetanus toxin had no effect on <b>fasciculation</b> in either culture system. Our results imply that NILE-mediated neurite-neurite interactions are stronger than N-CAM (embryonic) -mediated interactions in the E 14 brain cultures, whereas N-CAM (adult) -mediated interactions are stronger than NILE-mediated interactions in the P 5 cerebellar cultures...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPeripheral axons from {{auditory}} {{spiral ganglion}} neurons (SGNs) form an elaborate series of radially and spirally oriented projections that interpret complex {{aspects of the}} auditory environment. However, the developmental processes that shape these axon tracts are largely unknown. Radial bundles are comprised of dense SGN fascicles that project through otic mesenchyme to form synapses within the cochlea. Here, we show that radial bundle <b>fasciculation</b> and synapse formation are disrupted when Pou 3 f 4 (DFNX 2) is deleted from otic mesenchyme. Further, we demonstrate that Pou 3 f 4 binds to and directly regulates expression of Epha 4, Epha 4 −/− mice present similar SGN defects, and exogenous EphA 4 promotes SGN <b>fasciculation</b> {{in the absence of}} Pou 3 f 4. Finally, Efnb 2 deletion in SGNs leads to similar <b>fasciculation</b> defects, suggesting that ephrin-B 2 /EphA 4 interactions are critical during this process. These results indicate a model whereby Pou 3 f 4 in the otic mesenchyme establishes an Eph/ephrin-mediated <b>fasciculation</b> signal that promotes inner radial bundle formation...|$|R
40|$|Axons often grow along other axons {{to produce}} bundles called fascicles, {{and a number}} of cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) found on axon surfaces contribute to this process.

The present studies investigate whether such a linkage might reflect intracellular regulatory mechanisms. Results obtained with chicken retinal explants in culture indicate that <b>fasciculation</b> is highly sensitive to cytoplasmic protein phosphorylation by means of a mechanism that does not alter levels of CAM expression. Moreover, the potent effect of individual Fabs on <b>fasciculation</b> disappears with enhanced phosphorylation.
