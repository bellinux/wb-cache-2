25|$|Women in pre-modern society {{were seen}} as bearers of children, {{retailers}} of fish, and farmers. Within the traditional sphere, the childbearing ability of women was explained as {{the means by which}} lineage ancestors were allowed to be reborn. In pre-colonial times, polygamy was encouraged, especially for wealthy men. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was seen as a traditional means for parents to be acknowledged for taking <b>good</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> their daughters. Also to thank them for the good training. Within the last couples of decades, the roles of the feminine gender has evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women no longer 'belong to the kitchen', roles and responsibilities which hitherto remained the prerogative of females is now very common with males. Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as a host of past and current political office holders. This renaissance {{is a direct result of}} the efforts put in by Ghana's vibrant civil society. Women have since risen to positions of professional importance in southern Ghana.|$|E

The first book was published in 1796, and [...] aimed for a broader readership than the previous books. This included not just modest urban households, but also peasant wives who made up {{the majority of the population}} in Sweden at the time. Again Rückerschöld stressed the importance that women know proper housekeeping skills, and urged them to take <b>good</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the household economy to keep incompetent husbands from wrecking the family budget. Other than directions for simple dishes, there was money-saving strategies like baking one's own bread or cooperating with neighbors to buy larger quantities of food at lower prices. In the book Rückerschöld portrays herself as going on inspection in a peasant household, being shown the barn, larder, vegetable garden, etc., and having suggestions for improvements everywhere. Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök was awarded a silver medal by Patriotiska Sällskapet ("The Patriotic Society") for being the first cookbook written for poorer households. Twenty years earlier, the society had issued a challenge with this aim, but no one before Rückerschöld had managed to write such a book. In 1797, one year after the book was first published, a second edition came out.|$|E

[...] Soon after crossing into Concord, the Acton company passed the farm of Colonel James Barrett who commanded the provincial troops in Concord that morning. A small detachment of British soldiers were searching Barrett's farm for supplies, and Davis considered attacking them. [...] His orders, however, were to muster {{with the rest of the}} provincial militia and Minutemen near the Old North Bridge by the Concord River. [...] He then diverted his company off the road, avoiding the British at Barrett's farm and marching past a tavern belonging to a Widow Brown. [...] A boy named Charles Handley, who lived at Widow Brown's Tavern, saw Davis's company pass the tavern.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} district nurses’/nurses’ reflections of providing nursing to patients and support to families receiving palliative care within home care.

The overarching theme that emerged was: The valuable but limited time on the last trip and consisted of the two main categories: To overcome barriers to providing <b>good</b> <b>care</b> and See opportunities to create <b>good</b> nursing <b>care.</b> Factors that precluded that good nursing could be provided was when district nurses/nurses experienced resistance from patient or relatives, when language difficulties arose or when family relationships were disturbed. The participants described furthermore that good nursing could not be given when families did not accept support offered from district nurses/nurses in order to strengthen the families capacity to manage their situation or in cases when patients had no close relatives as caregivers who could participate in and facilitate care. Conditions to provide <b>good</b> <b>care</b> was experienced when patients were receptive to care and understood their situation, and when district nurses/nurses were able to get a good start with time to get to know the patient. The basis for being able to provide <b>good</b> <b>care</b> consisted <b>of</b> relatives´ willingness to participate in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the patient as well as of the nurses’ feeling secure in their role as a result of their long experience.
