40|$|Cell wall {{composition}} {{of a stable}} suspension of proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L. cv Abarr) cells is {{similar to those of}} tissues and cell suspensions of other graminaceous species. Extraction of hemicelluloses with step-wise increasing concentrations of alkali yields materials that, like those of <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> of maize coleoptiles, comprise mostly glucuronoarabinoxylan, xyloglucan, and small amounts of (1 - 3),(1 - 4) -Î²-d-glucan. As in the walls of <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> of the maize coleoptile, 5 -arabinosyl and 3 -arabinosyl comprise much higher proportions of the total hemicellulosic sugars than in walls of developed or elongated cells. Unlike cells of many dicotyledonous species, millet cells do not elongate or undergo observable differentiation during the stationary phase of culture, and consequently, their wall composition is remarkably consistent throughout the culture cycle. The proso millet cell suspension culture constitutes a reasonable model for study of cell wall biogenesis in <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> of a graminaceous species, but because of marked changes in the {{composition of}} hemicelluloses in these species during cell enlargement, additional model systems should be sought...|$|R

50|$|Children {{are most}} {{commonly}} identified with Aicardi syndrome {{before the age}} of five months. A significant number of girls are products of normal births and seem to be developing normally until around the age of three months, when they begin to have infantile spasms. The onset of infantile spasms at this age is due to closure of the final neural synapses in the brain, a stage of normal brain development. A number of tumors have been reported in association with Aicardi syndrome: choroid plexus papilloma (the most common), medulloblastoma, gastric hyperplastic polyps, rectal polyps, soft palate benign teratoma, hepatoblastoma, parapharyngeal <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> cancer, limb angiosarcoma and scalp lipoma.|$|E
50|$|The Bears were in {{the midst}} of a 1-13 season in 1969, the worst record in their history. Piccolo had finally earned a place in the {{starting}} lineup as an undersized fullback. Their first win came in the eighth game on November 9, a 38-7 home win over struggling Pittsburgh and Piccolo opened the scoring at Wrigley Field with a 25-yard touchdown reception. The next week in Atlanta, he scored a fourth quarter touchdown on a one-yard run, and then voluntarily removed himself from the game, something he had never done, raising great concern among his teammates and coaches. Breathing while playing had become extremely difficult for him, so when the team returned to Chicago he was promptly sent for a medical examination and diagnosed with <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe POU-domain {{transcription}} factor Oct 4 {{is essential for}} the maintenance of the mammalian germline. In this study, we show that the germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), an orphan nuclear receptor, represses Oct 4 gene activity by specifically binding within the proximal promoter. GCNF expression inversely correlates with Oct 4 expression in differentiating <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells.</b> GCNF overexpression in <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> represses Oct 4 gene and transgene activities, and we establish a link to transcriptional corepressors mediating repression by GCNF. In GCNF-deficient mouse embryos, Oct 4 expression is no longer restricted to the germ cell lineage after gastrulation. Our studies suggest that GCNF is critical in repressing Oct 4 gene activity as pluripotent stem cells differentiate and in confining Oct 4 expression to the germline...|$|R

40|$|A major {{determinant}} for transcriptional incompetence of {{murine leukemia}} virus (MLV) and MLV-derived vectors in <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> {{is located at the}} proline primer binding site (PBS). The mechanism of silencing is unknown, yet the effect is capable of spreading to adjacent promoters. Based on a retroviral vector containing an internal promoter and the escape mutant B 2 PBS with expressional capacity in <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells,</b> we have developed an assay to test the ability of putative insulators to shield the silencer at the PBS. Since the B 2 PBS reverts to the wild-type PBS at high frequency, a shielding ability of a putative insulator can be assessed from the ratio of expressing B 2 PBS to proline PBS proviruses in the target <b>embryonal</b> carcinoma <b>cell</b> population as measured by primer extension. Our results show that none of the possible insulators, scs, BEAD- 1, or HS 4, is able to shield an internal promoter from the repressive effect of the silencer at the PBS region when inserted between the silencer and the promoter...|$|R
50|$|On November 16, {{during the}} ninth {{game of the}} 1969 season in Atlanta, Piccolo voluntarily removed himself from the game due to extreme {{difficulty}} breathing on the field. When the team returned to Chicago, he received a medical examination and chest x-ray that revealed a malignancy. He was then diagnosed with <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma, an aggressive form of testicular cancer that had already spread to his chest cavity. After the diagnosis, Piccolo underwent surgery at Sloan-Kettering in New York City to remove the tumor. He had another surgery to remove his left lung and pectoral muscle in April 1970. Later in June of the same year, Piccolo started to feel chest pain and was re-admitted to the hospital, where doctors determined that the cancer had spread to other organs, most notably his liver.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the alpha-catenin expression pattern and DNA content have additional value over primary tumour histology, including information on vascular invasion and tunica albuginea invasion, in detecting occult metastasis in patients with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumours of the testis (NSGCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with clinical stage I NSGCT underwent retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLND) between 1986 and 1992. The orchidectomy specimens were histopathologically reviewed and immunohistochemically stained with mouse monoclonal anti-alpha-catenin antibody. The presence of an aberrant or negative staining in > 10 % of the malignant cells was defined as abnormal; in all other cases tumours were classified as normal. Furthermore, intact nuclei were isolated from 50 microm thick paraffin sections of the primary tumour, Feulgen stained, and analysed with an image-analysis system. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 14 had positive retroperitoneal nodes (stage IIa, 28 %), one pathologically staged I patient developed a lung metastasis (stage IV) within 3 months of RPLND. Univariate analysis showed {{that the presence of}} <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma, vascular invasion and tunica albuginea invasion were predictive for occult metastases. In multivariate logistic regression analysis only vascular and tunica albuginea invasion were significant. All 11 patients with no <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma in the primary tumour were classified as having pathological stage I disease. Also, the tumours which were DNA-diploid (three) or DNA-polyploid (two) were pathologically stage I. In screening for occult metastases the DNA content and the alpha-catenin expression pattern had no additional value. CONCLUSION: Vascular and tunica albuginea invasion have prognostic value in identifying patients with clinical stage I NSGCT at high risk for occult retroperitoneal disease. In contrast, the absence of <b>embryonal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma could predict all patients at low risk for metastasis. The DNA-ploidy also identified patients at low risk. Other DNA-analyses and the alpha-catenin expression pattern provided no additional information. Further studies are recommended to identify patients who are at low or high risk for metastasis...|$|E

40|$|Objective Nuclear actin is {{involved}} in transcription regulation by recruitment of histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers to the regulatory regions of active genes. In recent years, further attention {{has been focused on}} the role of actin as a nuclear protein in transcriptional processes.

Materials and Methods In this experimental study, differentiation of <b>embryonal</b> <b>cells</b> was induced by retinoic acid (RA), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate differential expression of marker genes before and 3 days after RA- induced differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with real-time PCR was then undertaken to monitor the incorporation of Î²-actin, as a functional component of RNA polymerase II, in the regulatory regions of marker genes.

40|$|A bioassay, {{based on}} tumorigenicity, has been {{developed}} to determine the mechanism whereby the blastocyst of the mouse controls malignant expression of embryonal carcinoma.

The results indicate that the blastocyst can regulate one <b>embryonal</b> carcinoma <b>cell</b> consistently; it may have a slight effect on three, but it cannot regulate four or five of them. The position of the <b>embryonal</b> carcinoma <b>cell</b> in the blastocyst is important.
