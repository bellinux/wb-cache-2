Later, he told an interviewer that he would [...] "never regret having helped run [...] out of the country". [...] Cooper was Wayne's longtime friend, and shared his conservative political views; {{he had been a}} [...] "friendly witness" [...] before HUAC, but did not implicate anyone as a suspected Communist, and later became a vigorous opponent of blacklisting. [...] Ironically, Cooper won an Academy Award for his performance, and since he was working in Europe at the time, asked Wayne to accept the Oscar on his behalf.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{compliance}} {{regulations are}} intended to foster and restore human trust in digital information records and, more broadly, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>businesses,</b> hospitals, and educational enterprises. In the health sector, storage and management of electronic health records have become a vital issue.

HIPAA and other regulations in the health sector require strict compliance with specific privacy and security requirements. Unfortunately, existing storage solutions do not live up to the task of ensuring compliance with mandated legislation. In this position paper, we discuss the main characteristics of the health sector record management regulations, and present a set of requirements for secure, trustworthy storage that complies with these regulations. We also briefly analyze existing storage models, and show that they are not suitable for meeting the requirements of health-care record storage. ...|$|R
