5|$|We {{received}} daily e-mails with feedback {{that was}} concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, {{and it was}} clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
25|$|The Genoveses {{made good}} on their veiled threat in April 1986, when DeCicco {{was killed by a}} car bomb outside of Castellano's former social club in Bensonhurst, then {{operated}} by Gambino capo James Failla. Gravano was at the club at the time and was blown off his feet by the blast. Gravano attempted to pull DeCicco from the wreckage but realized <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> when he saw various body parts scattered about.|$|E
2500|$|He {{began his}} radio {{career as a}} page at New York City station WMCA in 1932, after which he held a number of obscure radio jobs, {{including}} announcing. He strenuously objected to the professional name [...] "Morgan". What was wrong with his own name, Henry van Ost, Jr.? he asked. Too exotic, too unpronounceable, he was told. [...] "What about the successful announcers Harry von Zell or Westbrook Van Voorhis?" [...] he countered. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use,</b> and the bosses finally told Henry he could take the job or leave it. Thus began {{a long history of}} Henry's having arguments with executives.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{explaining}} the machine {{or how much}} can be made per day - {{that depends on the}} ground we get.|$|R
60|$|Seafaring {{people talk}} like this, {{because they are}} silly, and do not know any better. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> being angry with them.|$|R

2500|$|Red Cloud {{knew what}} was best for his people and had tried to keep peace with the whites, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use.</b> [...] The whites would not stay out of the Indianâ€™s country, and came and took their gold and killed off all their game. Thus started the trouble and the long bloody war when the {{soldiers}} came. [...] After the massacre at Wounded Knee, Red Cloud made a speech. [...] Flying Hawk asked to have the speech read to him, and McCreight brought a volume from the library containing the speech, and it was carefully translated to him by Thunder Bull to refresh his memory. [...] The Chief directed that it be included in his commentaries to tell why they killed Custer and his troopers, and about the Ghost Dance.|$|E
2500|$|... "Other Indians came to {{us after}} we got {{most of the men}} at the ravine. We all kept after them until they got to where Custer was. There was only a few of them left then. By that time all the Indians in the village got their horses and guns and watched Custer. When Custer got nearly to {{the lower end of the}} camp. he started to go down a gulch, but the Indians were {{surrounding}} him, and he tried to fight. They got off their horses and made a stand but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use.</b> Their horses ran down the ravine right into the village. The squaws caught them as fast as they came. One of them was a sorrel with white stocking. Long time after some of our relatives told us that they had seen Custer on that kind of horse when he was on the way to the Big Horn." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by breeches buoy. [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed the only thing that could be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried to drop anchor, but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke could see this effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use,</b> they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better. [...] There was nothing else that could be done.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{a disgrace}} to think more about that than {{anything}} else. But never mind. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> talking about <b>it,</b> words won't mend it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} things," [...] Harry {{said as he}} leapt to his feet. [...] "Crawl under shelter at once; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> getting a wetting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father, as you {{understand}} all about <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> my explaining any further. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> pretty late; I think I will be turning in." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cox {{sighed and}} shook her head. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> pretending with Mrs. Berry.|$|E
60|$|And {{the bird}} saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> talking, {{and went down}} to the earth again.|$|E
60|$|Auntie {{knew from}} my tone <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> trying {{to stand in}} my way any longer.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> my {{saying to}} him in an {{emotional}} [...] voice: [...] "This is your Mother, she laid {{you when you were}} [...] an egg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't care {{if there}} isn't, and I {{am not going}} to the forest. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> your talking; nothing will make me change my mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{would be}} very {{valuable}} to a bold man," [...] she said. [...] "What would you give for <b>it?</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> offering a small thing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{putting things}} prettily {{to her when}} she snapped you up in this way.|$|E
60|$|But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use.</b> Before I could {{arrest him}} he had {{sat down on the}} bed, and it was a melancholy ruin.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, mutely, {{because she knew}} there was {{something}} wrong and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> for her to ask what.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{think that}} such visitings would have <b>been</b> unwise. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> my {{blinking}} <b>it</b> to you. I {{do not believe}} that the marriage is practicable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I {{help you}} to land, friends?" [...] said Martin, mocking them. [...] "No, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> looking right or left, the mud there is very deep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrong. Yes;--very, very wrong. Janet, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> your {{talking to}} me. I have quite {{made up my}} mind. I cannot and I will not marry Mr. Gilmore." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{for him to}} try; {{he could}} no more get it--well--than I could if I {{had been in his}} place.|$|E
60|$|And we {{all turned}} and walked away. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> to blow her up. She wouldn't have minded it. But she lost three customers.|$|E
60|$|The Merry Little Breezes {{saw that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{at all to}} try to tempt Striped Chipmunk to play with them or to answer questions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Keep {{straight}} forward. That <b>is</b> right. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{going that}} way. The bazaar is shut. There is Fakreddin, there is Osman Effendi. He {{has got a}} new page.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Plainly more. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{blinking}} that. Legally I {{have married}} her--God help us both!--in soul and spirit I have married you, {{and no other}} woman in the world!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Chetwynde, {{will you}} order the trumpeter {{to sound the}} recall? They are leaving our men behind fast. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> losing four troopers {{as well as two}} prisoners." ...|$|R
60|$|His visitor hesitated. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{asking for}} too much; {{on the other}} hand, to ask for less than he could get would be unpardonable folly.|$|E
6000|$|Where then?--home? Never! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> going there. That {{was less}} than no use. It could not be done. There was somewhere else to go. Where? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I waited {{till they}} had left this morning, thinking, I suppose, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> to stay longer, and then started to see if your honour were here.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a prisoner, miss; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> {{blinking}} the matter," [...] {{said the}} soldier, drily. [...] "I must cut your dress {{if you are}} in such a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell. <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> your cocking your pistol, sir. You may kill me, but you cannot make me {{tell you}} that which I do not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} the thing we long for most {{invariably}} comes when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> to us?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, we {{will go back to}} the shanty." ...|$|R
