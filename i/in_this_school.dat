25|$|After {{finishing}} {{the work in}} middle school, she went to Putian high school. At this time, her mother finally accepted her studies because of her brilliant work in middle school and was happy with her accomplishments.However, she stayed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> for only 1 year because of society’s situation. At that period, Japan started some small wars with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of students <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> were angry about that and held many parades to boycott Japan. But a lot of Japanese soldiers and spies stayed in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Because of this, the study could not continue. So Lanying Lin transferred after one {{year in high school}} to a women’s school called Hami Lton School, which was founded by an American. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lanying helped the teacher as an assistant. So every time the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would help to teach in Chinese. Because of this, she was called ‘little teacher’ by her classmates.|$|E

25|$|In this sampradaya, the {{significance}} of Radha {{is not less than}} {{the significance}} of Sri Krsna. Both are conjointly the object to be worshiped <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> of Nimbarka, who {{is also one of the}} first commentators on Brahma Sutras under the name Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha. The later acharyas of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in the 13th and 14th centuries in Vrindavana composed much literature on the Divine Couple. Swami Sri Sribhatta, the elder god-brother of Jayadeva composed the Yugala Shataka for the Dhrupada style of musical presentation like Jayadeva, however unlike Jayadeva who composed his work in Sanskrit, Swami Shribhatta's compositions are in Vraja Bhasha, a Hindi vernacular which was understood by all inhabitants of Vraja. Indeed, the rest of the acharyas of this tradition wrote in Vraja Bhasha and due to the lack of prevalence of this language in modern times, very little research has been done, even though these Acharyas predate the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan by centuries.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} schools of thought among {{scholars}} as to the motivation {{for the creation of}} ogham. Scholars such as Carney and MacNeill have suggested that ogham was first created as a cryptic alphabet, designed by the Irish {{so as not to be}} understood by those with a knowledge of the Latin alphabet. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> of thought, it is asserted that the alphabet was created by Irish scholars or druids for political, military or religious reasons to provide a secret means of communication in opposition to the authorities of Roman Britain. The Roman Empire, which then ruled over neighbouring southern Britain, represented a very real threat of invasion to Ireland, which may have acted as a spur to the creation of the alphabet. Alternatively, in later centuries when the threat of invasion had receded and the Irish were themselves invading the western parts of Britain, the desire to keep communications secret from Romans or Romanised Britons would still have provided an incentive. With bilingual ogham and Latin inscriptions in Wales, however, one would suppose that the ogham could easily be decoded by anyone in the Post-Roman world.|$|E

25|$|The Montana Territory {{was formed}} on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming {{in the area}} before it was officially a {{territory}} as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children {{and the children of}} Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first {{to take advantage of the}} newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.|$|E
500|$|These later {{accounts}} {{were more}} willing to present Constantine as a genuine convert to Christianity. Beginning with Norman H. Baynes' Constantine the Great and the Christian Church (1929) and reinforced by Andreas Alföldi's The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome (1948), a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian. T. D. Barnes's seminal Constantine and Eusebius (1981) represents the culmination of this trend. Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion, which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire. Charles Matson Odahl's recent Constantine and the Christian Empire (2004) takes much the same tack. In spite of Barnes' work, arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion continue. Certain themes <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>school</b> reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's The Christianity of Constantine the Great (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood. A similar view of Constantine is held in Paul Veyne's recent (2007) work, Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien, which does not speculate {{on the origins of}} Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him, in his role as Emperor, as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant [...] "to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity".|$|E
500|$|On 5 August 1879, Kanō {{participated in}} a jūjutsu {{demonstration}} given for former United States president Ulysses S. Grant. This demonstration {{took place at the}} home of the prominent businessman Shibusawa Eiichi. Other people involved in this demonstration included the jūjutsu teachers Fukuda Hachinosuke and Iso Masatomo, and Kanō's training partner Godai Ryusaku. Fukuda died soon after this demonstration, at the age of 52. Kanō began studying with Iso, who had been a friend of Fukuda. Despite being 62 years old and standing only [...] tall, Iso had gained a powerful build from jujitsu training. He was known for excellence in kata, and was also a specialist in atemi, or the striking of vital areas. In Iso's method, one began with kata and then progressed to free fighting (randori). Due to Kanō's intense practice and his solid grounding in the jujitsu taught by Fukuda, he was soon an assistant at Iso's school. After Fukuda's death in 1881, Fukuda's widow gave the scrolls of the school to Kanō, then 21 years old. Some popular works suggest that Kanō obtained a teaching license <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>school,</b> but this has not been documented: no Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū certificate(s) with Kanō's name visible is depicted anywhere in the Kōdōkan museum or in any published source.
