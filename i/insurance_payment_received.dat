40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to explain the effect of {{government}} agricultural support payments on farmland rental prices. The regression specified farmland rental prices as a function of farm income (net of government <b>payments</b> <b>received),</b> and direct government agricultural support payments. The regression was estimated using seemingly unrelated regression for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012. Our results show the effect of government agricultural support payments on farmland rental prices was significant in 2002, then became insignificant for 2007 and 2012. We conclude the waning significance was caused by a change in the format of government support payments from a known value, activity-based payment, to a variable value, <b>insurance</b> <b>payment...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{builds a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} yield-based MPCI crop insurance policy for a risk averse rice farmer in Indonesia and presents the comparative statics analysis of policy variables on yield through the coupling, wealth, and insurance effects. Moreover, Using yield data from 1979 to 2014 for the Tuban Regency, this study applies numerical optimization to the model and simulates the effects of different policies on input use, certainty equivalents, indemnity payment, and premiums. The theoretical analysis shows that no coupling effect exists for change in the coverage level, while a coupling effect exists for change in the subsidy implying that farmers can impact {{the size of their}} payments by adjusting inputs and thus yield. For wealth effect, if the price market higher than the average cost of production, the wealth effect is ambiguous. If the price market smaller than the average cost of production, the wealth effect for the coverage levels is ambiguous, while the wealth effect for subsidy levels is negative, indicating a marginal increase in the subsidy reduces input use. For insurance effect, the analysis shows a positive sign for coverage level, revealing that an increase in the coverage level triggers the farmer using more inputs. On the other hand, the insurance effect for subsidy levels generates a negative sign, where higher subsidy cause the farmer to reduce input use. The numerical analysis shows that MPCI crop insurance indicates a moral hazard. At coverage levels of 30 % and above, the farmer does not expect to <b>receive</b> any indemnity <b>payment.</b> However, for coverage levels at or above 40 %, the farmer expects indemnity payments, which triggers a reduction in input use as the farmer tries to maximize both <b>insurance</b> <b>payments</b> and market revenue simultaneously. For certainty equivalent, farmers prefer the highest coverage level. For expected indemnity and <b>insurance</b> <b>payment,</b> farmers <b>receive</b> the highest <b>payment</b> for the largest high coverage level and subsidy. Hence, the result indicates that MPCI insurance with high coverage levels and low premium subsidies is suggested to Indonesian government since such policy results improving the farmers’ wellbeing while mitigating moral hazard facing the insurance provider...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{shows how}} {{intervention}} analysis {{can be used}} to estimate the dynamic and spatial impact of recovery from a natural disaster. Specifically, it shows how to estimate three distinct phases of recovery: immediate impact, transitory recovery impact, and negative aftershock. It also discusses the estimation of a permanent impact. The method is then used to estimate the impact on Florida's taxable sales of the recovery from Hurricane Andrew. Estimates are provided of the immediate and total impact in five regions, and the length of the recovery is discussed. The results are compared to earlier impact studies of natural disasters on taxable sales. On the basis of studies of other hurricanes, it is found that the recovery from Hurricane Andrew has taken much longer than might be expected It is also found that, despite the magnitude of the <b>insurance</b> and transfer <b>payments</b> <b>received</b> by victims, the impact on taxable sales was within the normal variation of taxable sales at the state level, but significantly larger at the MSA level. This paper considers whether intervention analysis {{can be used to}} estimate the dynamic and spatial impact of a natural disaster on a local economy. Few ap-plications of intervention analysis have been published in the major journal...|$|R
