25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a <b>DC</b> <b>field.</b> Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E
40|$|Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this paper We studied the {{mobility}} of λ-DNA in 20 nm channels using combined AC and <b>DC</b> <b>fields.</b> We present the mobility results of using 1 kHz AC <b>fields</b> added to <b>DC</b> <b>fields.</b> Mainly we found that at <b>DC</b> <b>fields</b> below 20 kV/m, the DNA mobility was significantly increased by the added AC, however, at <b>DC</b> <b>fields</b> above 20 kV/m, no influence was observed. In a previous investigation of the DNA transport in 20 nm channels under <b>DC</b> electric <b>fields,</b> {{it was observed that}} the DNA mobility was strongly dependent on the applied field strength [1]. The mobility increased with the field, and the DNA moved fluently. But above 30 kV/m, the DNA moved intermittently and the mobility decreased. For the explanation of this behaviour two hypotheses were made: steric trapping and dielectrophoretic (DEP) trapping [1]. Here we use the AC fields to try to increase the DEP forces possibly generated by imperfections on the channel surface, when the <b>DC</b> <b>fields</b> were applied The nanochannels were manufactured in fused silica chips by wet etching.

The observed behavior indicates that steric effects rather than dielectrophoretic effects are responsible for the observed low DNA mobility in 20 nm nanoslits.

2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of {{electronic}} ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power <b>d.c.</b> <b>field</b> addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on capacitively coupled plasma involves isolating {{one of the}} electrodes, usually with a capacitor. The capacitor appears like a short circuit to the high frequency RF field, but like an open circuit to direct current (<b>DC)</b> <b>field.</b> Electrons impinge on the electrode in the sheath, and the electrode quickly acquires a negative charge (or self-bias) because the capacitor does not allow it to discharge to ground. This sets up a secondary, <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> across the plasma {{in addition to the}} alternating current (AC) field. Massive ions are unable to react to the quickly changing AC field, but the strong, persistent <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> accelerates them toward the self-biased electrode. These energetic ions are exploited in many microfabrication processes (see reactive-ion etching (RIE)) by placing a substrate on the isolated (self-biased) electrode.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> model {{requires}} {{a very large}} thundercloud charge to create sufficient fields at high altitudes (e.g. 50-90 km, where sprites form). Unlike the case of sprites, these large charges {{do not seem to}} be associated with TGF-generating lightning. [...] Thus the <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> model requires the TGF to occur lower down, at the top of the thundercloud (10-20 km) where a local field can be stronger. This hypothesis is supported by two independent observations. First, the spectrum of the gamma-rays seen by RHESSI matches very well to the prediction of relativistic runaway at 15-20 km. Second, TGFs are strongly concentrated around Earth's equator when compared to lightning. [...] (They may also be concentrated over water compared to lightning in general.) Thundercloud tops are higher near the equator, and thus the gamma-rays from TGFs produced there have a better chance of escaping the atmosphere. The implication would then be that there are many lower-altitude TGFs not seen from space, particularly at higher latitudes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Several {{physiological}} and pathophysiological phenomena {{are known to}} cause slow shifts of the electrical brain potential.

50|$|Another type of {{electric}} field detected in electroreception is <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> potentials. All aquatic animals show DC fields, {{and it is}} the strongest in the head and gill region in species of fish. Teleosts had a range of about 500 µV potential around the gills, while elasmobrachs and crustaceans were 10 times weaker; but if a crustacean was wounded, its DC potential increased to 1 µV. A study by Peters and Bretschneider measured the bioelectric potential across catfish and found the strongest negative potential around the head and gills of the fish, measured 1 mm from the skin. Yet the sources of DC potentials are still not well understood, for potentials still persist even if the animal is anesthetized, so muscle contractions do not modulate DC potentials. Respiratory movements can module DC potentials, but are not caused by the contraction of muscles, since passive moments of the gill covers cause similar modulation in anesthetized or awake animals and muscle contractions produce high frequency signals. When a fish is hurt or distressed, it also emits a stronger <b>DC</b> <b>field</b> potential, which makes it more susceptible to predation.|$|E
