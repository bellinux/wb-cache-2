Workers are ferruginous-colored to dark red and present a distinctive morphology, consisting of a shield-like head with a broad vertex, ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, and unique among ants– an antenna socket apparatus sitting upside-down. Little {{is known about the}} biology of the ants, but they are likely nocturnal and specialist predators.|$|E

5|$|Bennington served In the Pacific for {{a little}} more than four years. For the most part, her duty {{consisted}} of cruising along the west coast protecting American interests in Latin America during the numerous political upheavals that occurred at that time <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> America. In addition, she made two extended cruises to the Hawaiian Islands. The first came after a group of pro-royalists attempted in January 1895 to stage a countercoup against the provisional government of the islands. Bennington departed Mare Island on 28 May, arrived at Honolulu on 5 June, and spent the next nine months protecting American interests in the islands. On 5 March 1896, she departed Honolulu, bound for San Francisco where she arrived on 16 March. The following day, the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for five months of repairs.|$|E

The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E
