Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E

Hemings had {{the legal right}} to remain in France as a free person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E

As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E

25|$|The second {{approach}} {{fell into}} the category of conditional marriages, t'nai b'kiddushin, and was based in part on past approaches used by both the French and Turkish rabbinates—but, according to Rabinowitz—had improvements gleaned from lessons learned from those past experiences. The ketubah was not changed, but a separate pre-marital agreement was signed, and {{in the presence of the}} rabbinical court, the prospective groom read it, and the prospective bride stated that she agreed to it. The agreement was that the parties understood that if a civil divorce were ever granted, then a get must be delivered within six months of that date. A refusal to abide by that agreement would give the court no choice but to consider the original marriage, and the original declaration of the groom, so flawed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> if that marriage never occurred.|$|E
25|$|As {{the war of}} the Rough Wooing continued, by 22 February 1548 Mary, Queen of Scots was in the castle.

Mary of Guise was at the castle in the first days of May 1548 and Mary, Queen of Scots was kept at the castle for several months before her embarkation for France for safety on 13 July 1548. The sailing however was delayed by adverse winds till 7 August 1548. Her party including the Four Marys left the Clyde in a fleet under the command of Nicolas de Villegagnon. They sailed around the west coast of Ireland, to avoid English ships commanded by Edward Clinton.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{archaeologist}} Melvin L. Fowler {{noticed that}} the northeastern corner of the unusually aligned Mound 72 was located on a north/south axis aligned with the southwestern corner of Monks Mound and {{the western edge of}} Mound 49, an east/west oriented ridgetop mound located within the Grand Plaza area of downtown Cahokia. After discussions with Warren Wittry (the discoverer of the Cahokia Woodhenge) about the north/south axis alignment and the mounds longitudinal alignment along the axis of the solstices, he hypothesized that a large post may have marked the location. After getting funding he began a series of excavations at the mound in 1967 that lasted into the early 1970s. The post pit hole was found where he had predicted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> <b>as</b> were several others in an arc to the northwest, along with the spectacular series of burials located within and under the mound. Mound 96, a previously unnoticed small mound to the southwest, was discovered and numbered at this time. By 1977 Fowler was again studying aerial photos and maps of the location when he noticed that measurements concerning the two mounds and associated postholes corresponded nearly exactly with circumference and diameter measurements from Woodhenge III. He plotted a set of postholes predictions and eventually received funding to excavate in the early 1990s. In excavations lasting throughout the 1990s he excavated parts of Mound 96 and several projected posthole locations looking for proof of a hypothesized southern woodhenge at Cahokia. Not all archaeologists associated with Cahokia agreed with his conclusions and predictions at the time. Although weather-related problems, low-lying terrain with flooding issues and other factors made the endeavor difficult, Fowler eventually located several other post pits at or near their predicted locations, including the winter solstice sunset position under Mound 96.|$|E

500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> {{easy to use}} and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a fashion statement with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury were uniformly glowing.

[...] The Daily News praised the author: [...] "In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers, and never has his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a little piece entitled Trial by Jury". [...] The Daily Telegraph concluded that the piece illustrated the composer's [...] "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class". [...] Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. [...] One noted that [...] "so completely is each imbued with the same spirit, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert's verses without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's verses.

500|$|With {{a variety}} of writers and {{producers}} and its new musical direction for Carey, the album was always {{likely to be a}} commercial success. Carey and Combs wrote the lead single, [...] "Honey." [...] Combs believed this to be a good song but was uncertain how successful <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> a release owing to its heavy hip hop influence. The remix for [...] "Honey" [...] featured rapping lead vocals from Da Brat, The LOX and Mase, and some verses were rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different from Carey's previous recordings, and was described by author Chris Nickson as [...] "street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass." [...] The song's melody was driven by Q-Tip's drum programming and Stevie J's keyboard notes. Combs's production gave the song a [...] "light and airy" [...] effect, further distancing it from Carey's contemporary sound. [...] "Honey" [...] featured musical samples from Treacherous Three's [...] "The Body Rock", and [...] "Hey DJ" [...] by The World's Famous Supreme Team. The track used both hip hop and R with traces of pop music and was described as a [...] " [...] catchy chorus, combining hip hop and pop into something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1932 the {{conductor}} Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with {{the backing of}} rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham's return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s.

Beecham responded, [...] "I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career." [...] In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge's new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO. His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in [...] "the most auspicious circumstances and éclat".|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E

2500|$|Strongly {{fluorescent}} pigments {{often have}} an unusual appearance {{which is often}} described colloquially as a [...] "neon color."
