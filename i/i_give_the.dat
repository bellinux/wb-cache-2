500|$|The {{next morning}} at about 6:00am Virginia, {{accompanied}} by , [...] and , got underway from Sewell's Point to finish off Minnesota {{and the rest of}} the blockaders, but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00am. In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of Minnesota, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered, [...] "Tell Mr. Green not to fire till <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot." ...|$|E

500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
500|$|Spanish horses {{also were}} spread widely {{as a tool}} of {{diplomacy}} by the government of Spain, which granted both horses and export rights to favored citizens and to other royalty. As early as the 15th century, the Spanish horse was widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean, and was known in northern European countries, despite being less common and more expensive there. As time went on, kings from across Europe, including every French monarch from Francis I to Louis XVI, had equestrian portraits created showing themselves riding Spanish-type horses. The kings of France, including Louis XIII and Louis XIV, especially preferred the Spanish horse; the head groom to Henri IV, Salomon de la Broue, said in 1600, [...] "Comparing the best horses, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Spanish horse first place for its perfection, because it is the most beautiful, noble, graceful and courageous". War horses from Spain and Portugal began to be introduced to England in the 12th century, and importation continued through the 15th century. In the 16th century, Henry VIII received gifts of Spanish horses from Charles V, Ferdinand II of Aragon and the Duke of Savoy and others when he wed Katherine of Aragon. [...] He also purchased additional war and riding horses through agents in Spain. By 1576, Spanish horses made up one third of British royal studs at Malmesbury and Tutbury. The Spanish horse peaked in popularity in Great Britain during the 17th century, when horses were freely imported from Spain and exchanged as gifts between royal families. With the introduction of the Thoroughbred, interest in the Spanish horse faded after the mid-18th century, although they remained popular through the early 19th century. The Conquistadors of the 16thcentury rode Spanish horses, particularly animals from Andalusia, and the modern Andalusian descended from similar bloodstock. By 1500, Spanish horses were established in studs on Santo Domingo, and Spanish horses made their way into the ancestry of many breeds founded in North and South America. Many Spanish explorers from the 16th century on brought Spanish horses with them for use as war horses and later as breeding stock. By 1642, the Spanish horse had spread to Moldovia, to the stables of Transylvanian prince George Rakoczi.|$|E

She has been described as [...] "the nice judge" [...] and has been accused of being a [...] "fence-sitter" [...] – unable to provide criticism of any kind. Hines counters such criticism with: [...] "Well, you know, I’m living it, if you get my drift, so the advice <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> kids is the advice I’m living." [...] The success of the program has led to further interest in her as a recording artist and in 2004 she released an album of cover versions, titled Hinesight – Songs from the Journey which featured a duet, with former Home and Away star Belinda Emmett, [...] "Shower the People". In 2005 Hines released a remixed version of her earlier hit [...] "You", followed in 2006 by Discotheque an album containing her versions of disco classics, which peaked at number 6.
