40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comparison}} of the properties of <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> compact groups, loose groups and in the field to deepen our understanding of the physical mechanisms acting upon <b>galaxy</b> evolution <b>in</b> different environments. We select samples of <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> compact groups identified by McConnachie et al., loose groups identified by Zandivarez and Martinez, and field galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare properties of the <b>galaxy</b> populations <b>in</b> these different environments: absolute magnitude, colour, size, surface brightness, stellar mass and concentration. We also study the fraction of red and early type galaxies, the luminosity function, the colour-luminosity and luminosity-size relations. The population of <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> compact groups differ from that of loose groups and the field. The fraction of read and early type <b>galaxies</b> is higher <b>in</b> compact groups. On average, <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> compact groups are systematically smaller, more concentrated and have higher surface brightness than <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the field and in loose groups. For fixed absolute magnitude, or fixed surface brightness, <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> compact groups are smaller.

40|$|We {{study how}} the void {{environment}} affects the chemical evolution of <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the universe {{by comparing the}} oxygen and nitrogen abundances of dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> voids with dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> denser regions. Using spectroscopic observations from SDSS DR 7, we estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of 993 void dwarf galaxies and 759 dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> denser regions. We use the Direct Te method for calculating the gas-phase chemical abundances <b>in</b> the dwarf <b>galaxies</b> because it is best suited for low metallicity, low mass (dwarf) galaxies. A substitute for the [OII] 3727 doublet is developed, permitting oxygen abundance estimates of SDSS dwarf galaxies at all redshifts with the Direct Te method. We find that void dwarf galaxies have slightly higher oxygen abundances than dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> denser environments. The opposite trend is seen in both the nitrogen abundance and N/O ratio: void dwarf galaxies have slightly lower nitrogen abundances and lower N/O ratios than dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> denser regions. Our mass-N/O relationship shows that the secondary production of nitrogen commences at a lower stellar mass <b>in</b> void dwarf <b>galaxies</b> than <b>in</b> dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> denser environments. The lower N/O ratios and smaller stellar mass for secondary nitrogen production seen <b>in</b> void dwarf <b>galaxies</b> may indicate both delayed star formation and a dependence of cosmic downsizing on the large-scale environment.

40|$|Abridged] We present here {{a new and}} {{homogeneous}} {{sample of}} 3340 galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) {{based solely on the}} observed strength of their Hdelta absorption line. These galaxies are commonly known as ``post-starburst'' or ``E+A'' galaxies, and the study of these galaxies has been severely hampered by the lack of a large, statistical sample of such <b>galaxies.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we rectify this problem by selecting a sample of galaxies which possess an absorption Hdelta equivalent width of EW(Hdelta_max) - Delta EW(Hdelta_max) > 4 A from 106682 <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the SDSS. We have performed extensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies of measuring the Hdelta absorption and studying the effects of stellar absorption, dust extinction, emission-filling and measurement error. The measured abundance of our Hdelta-selected (HDS) galaxies is 2. 6 +/- 0. 1 % of all galaxies within a volume-limited sample of 0. 05 <z< 0. 1 and M(r*) <- 20. 5, which is consistent with previous studies of such <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the literature. We find that only 25 of our HDS <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> this volume-limited sample (3. 5 +/- 0. 7 %) show no evidence for OII and Halpha emission, thus indicating that true E+A (or k+a) galaxies are extremely rare objects at low redshift, i. e., only 0. 09 +/- 0. 02 % of all <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> this volume-limited sample are true E+A <b>galaxies.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, 89 +/- 5 % of our HDS <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the volume-limited sample have significant detections of the OII and Halpha emission lines. We find 27 <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> our volume-limited HDS sample that possess no detectable OII emission, but do however possess detectable Halpha emission. These galaxies may be dusty star-forming galaxies. We provide the community with this new catalog of Hdelta-selected <b>galaxies</b> to aid <b>in</b> the understanding of these galaxies.
