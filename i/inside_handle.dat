5000|$|Latchbolt : The {{latchbolt}} is spring-loaded, {{allowing the}} door to be closed without first retracting the bolt. In addition, the bolt may be fitted with a guardbolt, which is arranged to prevent the unwanted retraction of the latchbolt by an intruder; {{in this case the}} latchbolt is called a deadlocking latchbolt. There may be a provision on the <b>inside</b> <b>handle</b> to disable (lock) the outside handle from operating the latchbolt; this is referred to in the table below as the [...] "inside locking mechanism". This mechanism may consist of a push button or turn button in the <b>inside</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In some lockset functions, the <b>inside</b> <b>handle</b> retracts {{the latch}} (and deadbolt, if present) {{even when the}} door is locked; this feature is {{intended}} to allow those inside {{to open the door}} without difficulty under possible emergency circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>inside</b> <b>handle</b> {{may have}} an {{affordance}} for locking the latchbolt: {{it may be a}} push button, a turn button, or may operate in both modes. It is referred to in the table as the [...] "inside locking mechanism".|$|E

25|$|Frame Lock – Also {{known as}} the {{integral}} lock or monolock, this locking mechanism was invented by custom knifemaker Chris Reeve for the Sebenza as an update to the liner lock. The frame lock works {{in a manner similar}} to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner <b>inside</b> the <b>handle</b> to hold the blade in place.|$|R
5000|$|The Swiss Army knife {{generally}} has a main spearpoint blade, {{as well as}} various tools, such as screwdrivers, a can opener, and many others. These attachments are stowed <b>inside</b> the <b>handle</b> of the knife through a pivot point mechanism. The handle is usually red, and features a Victorinox or Wenger [...] "cross" [...] logo or, for Swiss military issue knives, the coat of arms of Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|Kicker (or Kick): Area on {{the blade}} that {{prevents}} the sharp edge from touching the <b>inside</b> of the <b>handle</b> and suffering damage. This is sometimes supplanted by an additional tang pin above the pivots.|$|R

50|$|Cathole trowel is {{used for}} burying {{personal}} waste in the backcountry. They are often made of lighter weight materials than gardening trowels to make them easier to carry. Also, they may have features such as ruled sides to measure for proper cathole depth or jagged edges for cutting through roots or frozen soil. Some cathole trowels {{are also designed to}} fold-up or collapse into a smaller size for easier storage. Others allow for items such as toilet paper to be stored <b>inside</b> the <b>handle.</b>|$|R

40|$|Green glass chalice {{on short}} stem with two opaque blue handles applied to sides. Unworked rim is rough with many small chips. It bulges out {{slightly}} forming a shallow and narrow ridge {{inside of the}} vessel, perhaps to support a lid. Sides are gently curved in at the bottom. Twisted, hollow stem in similar green glass, is applied unevenly, constricted sloppily and has a lopsided flaring rim with a ridge on its <b>inside.</b> <b>Handles</b> are of poor glass which appear to be striped with white due to bubbles. The handles are approx. 2 cm below rim, protrude in a rectangular shape, and have long tails which were impressed while hot to form regular, short, slightly diagonal ridges. The ridged tails {{are attached to the}} side of the chalice and continue to the stem.; The body of this vessel has a design of irregularly shaped and irregularly spaced small bulges. These protrude only slightly on the outside, more on the inside. They begin about 3 cm from rim and are very small. Their size increases as they progress towards base. They are perhaps meant to imitate faceted glass. The glass may have been blown into a cylinder and then pulled down to form this design.; Body cracked and mended with two pieces missing. Some bubbles; sandy and black impurities; some black encrustation, especially around stem...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to study the ground or {{metastable}} state structure of nematic liquid crystal systems confined <b>inside</b> <b>handled</b> shapes such as a torus or double torus. We begin our work by introducing a new method to generate a toroidal droplet from a Newtonian liquid inside another, immiscible, Newtonian liquid. In this situation, a toroidal droplet is unstable and follows one of two routes in transforming into a spherical droplet: (i) its tube breaks in a way reminiscent to the breakup of a cylindrical jet, or (ii) its tube grows until it finally coalesces onto itself. However, {{to be able to}} probe the nematic structure, we need {{to address the issue of}} instabilities. This is done by replacing the outer liquid with a yield stress material, which ultimately leads to the stabilization of the toroidal droplet. Through the experimental investigation, we are able to establish the stabilization conditions. Finally, we generate and stabilize toroidal droplets with a nematic liquid crystal as the inner liquid and a yield stress material as the outer medium. Here we observe that in the ground state, the nematic liquid crystal exhibits an intriguing twisted structure irrespective of the aspect ratio of the torus. While there are no defects observed in a toroidal droplet case, two defects with - 1 topological charge each emerge each time we increase the number of handles. Ph. D...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{electric}} toothbrushes run on low voltage, 12v or less. A few units use a {{step-down transformer}} {{to power the}} brush, but most use a battery, usually but not always rechargeable and non-replaceable, fitted <b>inside</b> the <b>handle,</b> which is hermetically sealed to prevent water damage. While early NiCd battery toothbrushes used metal tabs {{to connect with the}} charging base, modern toothbrushes use contactless inductive charging: the brush unit and charger stand each contain a coil of wire; when placed in proximity, the powered coil from the stand transfers power by induction to the handle, charging the battery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the M roadster features several unique items including a chrome-ringed instrument cluster with red needles and the M logo, three auxiliary chrome-ringed gauges in the center console, power and heated sport seats with special pleated leather trim (monotone black or two-tone), a 375 mm three-spoke M steering wheel with tri-color stitching, an illuminated M leather shift knob with the M logo on the shift pattern and a chrome boot surround, an oval-shaped rear-view mirror, leather door pulls and center console trim, chrome <b>inside</b> door <b>handles,</b> and door sill plates with the [...] "M" [...] logo.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the liner}} lock, an [...] "L"-shaped {{split in the}} liner allows part of the liner to move {{sideways}} from its resting position against the handle to {{the centre of the}} knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate. A frame lock is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner <b>inside</b> the <b>handle</b> material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.|$|R
