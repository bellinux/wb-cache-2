40|$|We propose an {{extension}} {{to the standard}} model where three exotic fermion 5 -plets and one scalar 6 -plet {{are added to the}} particle content. By demanding that all interactions are renormalizable and standard model gauge invariant, we show that the lightest <b>exotic</b> <b>particle</b> in this model can be a dark matter candidate as long as the new 6 -plet scalar does not develop a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Furthermore, light neutrino masses are generated radiatively at one-loop while the baryon asymmetry is produced by the CP-violating decays of the second lightest <b>exotic</b> <b>particle.</b> We have demonstrated using concrete examples that there is a parameter space where a consistent solution to the problems of baryon asymmetry, dark matter and neutrino masses can be obtained.

40|$|We {{consider}} supersymmetric {{models in}} which the neutral Wino is the lightest superparticle (LSP), and study the possibility that non-thermally produced Wino {{plays the role of}} dark matter. The thermal relic density of Wino is smaller than the present mass density of dark matter if wino mass is smaller than 2. 9 TeV; however, even with smaller Wino mass, Wino can be the dominant component of dark matter if it is non-thermally produced by the decay of an <b>exotic</b> <b>particle.</b> In order to study such a possibility in detail, we perform a precise calculation of the present mass density of Wino produced by the exotic-particle decay, taking account of the following effects: (i) coannihilation among charged and neutral Winos, and (ii) Sommerfeld effect on the pair annihilation cross section of Winos. We consider several well-motivated cases where the <b>exotic</b> <b>particle</b> corresponds to cosmological moduli fields, gravitino, or axino, and discuss the implication of the Wino LSP for these cases.
