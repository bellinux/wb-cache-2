5|$|On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh {{situation}} by {{giving a speech}} to the officers. Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, Congress passed a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of <b>full</b> <b>pay.</b> Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780.

Differing from earlier petitions, this one spoke for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote to members of Congress that the officers' claims were legitimate.
