The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf <b>exchange</b> <b>budget</b> are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998 – 2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{estimates}} of the atmospheric CO 2 uptake by continental shelf seas were constrained within the 0. 18 - 0. 45 Pg C yr- 1 range. However, most of those estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data sets of local flux measurements (n < 100). Here we propose to derive the CO 2 air-sea exchange of the shelf seas by extracting 3 · 106 direct surface ocean CO 2 measurements from the global database SOCAT (Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas), atmospheric CO 2 values from GlobalVIEW and calculating gas transfer rates using readily available global temperature, salinity, and wind speed fields. We then aggregate our results using a global segmentation of the shelf in 45 units and 152 subunits to establish a consistent regionalized CO 2 <b>exchange</b> <b>budget</b> at the global scale. Within each unit, the data density determines the spatial and temporal resolutions at which the air-sea CO 2 fluxes are calculated and range from a 0. 5 ° resolution in the best surveyed regions to a whole unit resolution in areas where data coverage is limited. Our approach also accounts, for the first time, for the partial sea ice cover of polar shelves. Our new regionalized global CO 2 sink estimate of 0. 19 ± 0. 05 Pg C yr- 1 falls in {{the low end of}} previous estimates. Reported to an ice-free surface area of 22 · 106 km 2, this value yields a flux density of 0. 7 mol C m- 2 yr- 1, ∼ 40 % more intense than that of the open ocean. Our results also highlight the significant contribution of Arctic shelves to this global CO 2 uptake (0. 07 Pg C yr- 1). SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{can affect}} many ecosystem processes, particularly in oligotrophic habitats, {{and is expected}} to affect soil C storage potential through increases in microbial decomposition rate as a consequence of greater N availability. Increased N availability may also result in changes in the principal limitations on ecosystem productivity. Phosphorus (P) limitation may constrain productivity in instances of high N deposition, yet ecosystem responses to P availability are poorly understood. This study investigated CO 2 and CH 4 flux responses to N and P enrichment using both short- (1 year) and long-term (16 year) nutrient addition experiments. We hypothesised that the addition of either N or P will increase CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes, since both plant production and microbial activity are likely to increase with alleviation from nutrient limitation. This study demonstrated the modification of C fluxes from N and P enrichment, with differing results subject to the duration of nutrient addition. On average, relative to control, the addition of N alone inhibited CO 2 flux in the short-term (- 9 %) but considerably increased CO 2 emissions in the long-term (+ 35 %), reduced CH 4 uptake in the short term (- 90 %) and reduced CH 4 emission in the long term (- 94 %). Phosphorus addition increased CO 2 and CH 4 emission in the short term (+ 20 % and + 184 % respectively), with diminishing effect into the long term, suggesting microbial communities at these sites are P limited.

40|$|Permafrost landscapes in {{northern}} high latitudes with their massive organic carbon stocks are an important, poorly known, {{component of the}} global carbon cycle. However, in light of future Arctic warming, the sustainability of these carbon pools is uncertain. To a large part, {{this is due to}} a limited understanding of the carbon cycle processes because of sparse observations in Arctic permafrost ecosystems. Here, we present an eddy covariance dataset covering more than three years of continuous CO 2 and CH 4 flux observations within a moist tussock tundra ecosystem near Chersky in North-eastern Siberia. Through parallel observations of a disturbed (drained) area and a control area nearby, we aim to evaluate the long-term effects of a persistently lowered water table on the net vertical carbon <b>exchange</b> <b>budgets</b> and the dominating biogeochemical mechanisms. Persistently drier soils trigger systematic shifts in the tundra ecosystem carbon cycle patterns. Both, uptake rates of CO 2 and emissions of CH 4 decreased. Year-round measurements emphasize the importance of the non-growing season – in particular the “zero-curtain” period in the fall – to the annual budget. Approximately 60 % of the CO 2 uptake in the growing-season is lost during the cold-seasons, while CH 4 emissions during the non-growing season account for 30 % of the annual budget. Year-to-year variability in temperature conditions during the late growing season were identified as the primary control of the interannual variability observed in the CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes...|$|R
40|$|The IMF {{began to}} play a {{prominent}} role in low-income countries in the late 1970 s and 1980 s when many countries faced overvalued <b>exchange</b> rates, growing <b>budget</b> deficits, high inflation, and low reserves. But times have changed, and many low-income countries no longer face these problems and do not need classic IMF programs. This paper explores options for the role of the IMF in well-performing low-income countries that no longer require IMF financing. It argues that in these countries the IMF should use more non-funded programs, and it should play a much less dominant role in overall conditionality. These countries should be able to focus more on achieving high-priority development goals that are outside the expertise of the IMF, such as in health, water, education, private sector development, and agriculture. While playing a less prominent role, the Fund should continue to be engaged in helping countries to maintain an appropriate macroeconomic framework. For some countries, a non-funded program like the new Policy Support Instrument (PSI) would be appropriate, while others could shift further to a program of surveillance and monitoring. In well-performing countries the Fund should provide public ratings on macroeconomic policy, ideally fully incorporated into the World Bank’s CPIA rating system.

The overall vision of NIGEC may be stated as the performance of academic research on the regional interactions between ecosystems and climate. NIGEC's research presents important evidence on the impacts of climate variability and change, and in some cases adaptability, for a broad range of both managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and has thereby documented significant regional issues on the environmental responses to climate change. NIGEC's research has demonstrated large regional differences in the atmospheric carbon <b>exchange</b> <b>budgets</b> of croplands and forests, that there are significant variations of this exchange on diurnal, synoptic, seasonal and interannual time scales due to atmospheric variability (including temperature, precipitation and cloudiness), and that management practices and past history have predominant effects in grasslands and croplands.

This paper investigates the negative effects of exchange controls on trade. To minimize evasion of controls, countries often intensify inspections at the border and increase documentation requirements. Thus, the cost of conducting trade rises. The paper finds that a one standard-deviation increase in the controls on trade payment has the same negative effect on trade as an increase in tariff by about 14 percentage points. A one standard-deviation increase in the controls on FX transactions reduces trade by the same amount as a rise in tariff by 11 percentage points.

40|$|Although theory {{suggests}} that the real exchange rate should depreciate after a credible trade liberalization but could appreciate temporarily with a noncredible one, little empirical evidence exists. Unlike existing studies that use either indirect tests or unreliable openness measures, this paper uses an event study based on carefully documented trade liberalization in 45 countries. The result shows that real exchange rates depreciate after countries open their economies to trade. In countries with multiple liberalization episodes, however, real exchange rates appreciate during early episodes, suggesting that partial or noncredible trade liberalizations are associated with real appreciation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} external and domestic influences on Latin America’s economic performance {{over the past}} decade and a half. It notes that over the past few years, macroeconomic policies have strengthened and structural reforms have been implemented. Together with a favorable external environment, these policies have contributed to Latin America’s relatively sharp economic recovery from its last recession. The study discusses the priorities for the region’s reform agenda that could help to ensure that this growing prosperity becomes entrenched. It also makes observations on the future roles of the major policymakers involved [...] the governments in the region; the international financial institutions, and especially the IMF; and industrial country governments.
