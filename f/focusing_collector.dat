40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of efficient solar receivers for {{different types of}} solar collectors such as point focusing, line focusing and external towers have received major attention in solar thermal power conversion process. The point focusing or parabolic concentrators need the receiver with internal cavity absorber and heat transfer system design with limited length and diameter. The line focusing collectors are not limited by its receiver length {{with respect to the}} trough. In this regard an experimental simulation was carried out to enhance the overall heat transfer coefficient by effective design of shell and helical tube heat exchanger using silver (Ag) Nano particles with water as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF), which reduces the length of the receiver in point <b>focusing</b> <b>collector.</b> The line <b>focusing</b> <b>collector</b> was analysed by 3 D numerical model with porous discs of top half, bottom half, combination of top & bottom half and full shape with silicon carbide ceramic foam as a material to evaluate the performance of the receiver to suit for line focusing collectors.

40|$|Variable sun elevation, {{azimuthal}} and declination angles {{with the}} time of day, and seasons of the year respectively, give variable projected image size defects produced by field site concave mirrors on the central cavity receiver's aperture entrance. If the aperture is small, it will be inefficient for periods when the solar isolation is inclined due to spillage. However, if the aperture is large, it will be inefficient for periods when the solar isolation is normal, due to excess heat radiation and convection losses. Thus, the fixed aperture area size is a compromise between ideal sizes for different conditions. The end result is a loss of efficiency {{as a function of}} time of day and seasons of the year. This research presents an approach to maximize the interception factor on the receiver entrance, with reducing the heat losses by radiation and convection through its aperture area. A central receiver system, having a down-looking cavity with an irises aperture is being proposed for application in rich environmental solar conditions, utilized solar flux insolation throughout the day on the city of Kuwait. Solar tower <b>focusing</b> <b>collector</b> with a cavity type receiver having a fixed area aperture at the entrance is presented for comparison with the proposed technique.

The end result is the proposed system shows improved performance and capability. However, over the life-time of installation these advantages of the proposed system should overweigh its disadvantages of additional cost due to extra automation...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to forward}} {{scattering}} of direct sunlight in the atmosphere, the circumsolar region closely surrounding the solar disk looks very bright. The radiation coming from this region, the circumsolar radiation, is {{in large part}} included in common direct normal irradiance (DNI) measurements, but only partially intercepted by the receivers of <b>focusing</b> <b>collectors.</b> This effect has {{to be considered in}} the performance analysis of concentrating collectors in order to avoid overestimation of the intercepted irradiance. At times, the overestimation reaches more than 10 % for highly concentrating systems even for sky conditions with relevant DNI above 200 [*]W/m 2. The amount of circumsolar radiation varies strongly with time, location and sky conditions. However, no representative sunshape measurements exist for locations that are now of particular interest for concentrating solar power (CSP) or concentrating photovoltaics (CPV). A new sunshape measurement system is developed and analyzed in this study. The system consists of the sun and aureole measurement instrument (SAM), an AERONET sun photometer and postprocessing software. A measurement network is being created with the presented system. The uncertainty of this system is significantly lower than what was obtained with previous devices. In addition, the spectral optical properties of circumsolar radiation are determined.

40|$|Polycapillary optics can be {{designed}} {{for a wide variety}} of x-ray applications. They have been used as <b>focusing</b> <b>collectors</b> for x-ray astronomy, to produce large-area collimated beams for wafer analysis and to provide small focused beams for protein crystallography with low-power x-ray sources. They are also being developed for a number of medical applications, including the removal of Compton scattering with the resultant improvement in contrast and resolution in mammography, the production of monochromatic parallel beams for high-contrast imaging in a clinical setting and the detection and localization of radioactive tracers in prostate cancer. Other exciting applications are extensions of measurements normally performed at synchrotrons into laboratory or clinical settings because of the increased efficiency of source utilization. The realization of these applications has been advanced by the recent marked improvement in available optic quality and reproducibility. Manufacturing progress has been assisted by the development of simulation analyses which allow for increasingly accurate assessment of optics defects. Optics performance over the whole range of energy from 10 to 80 keV can often be matched with one or two fitting parameters. This software development is ongoing, as is development of crystallographic analysis software designed to be used with highly focused beams. Continuing optics manufacturing challenges include the advance of applications at energies above 40 keV and the production of optics for imaging which are of adequate clinical size.
