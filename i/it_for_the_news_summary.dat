2500|$|Jones then unfurled a large, square banner {{with white}} hand-lettering that read: [...] "HMO's are in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> money!! Live free, love safe or die." [...] Jones had made <b>the</b> banner {{specifically}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occasion and displayed <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> helicopters to see. As {{it was pretty}} windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures {{and returned to his}} truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by <b>news</b> helicopters recording <b>the</b> event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back of the truck and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|R

50|$|By quote {{stuffing}}, trading systems delay price quotes {{while the}} stuffing is occurring, simply by placing and canceling orders {{at a rate}} that substantially surpasses the bandwidth of market data feed lines. The orders pile up in buffers, and the delay (increased latency) lasts until the buffer drains. Trading systems slow down a direct exchange feed whenever they want, and the phantom orders {{do not need to be}} in a particular stock; they can be in any of the securities that cohabit the particular price (market data) feed. For example, phantom orders at the rate of over about 10,000 messages/second, even for fractions of a second, delay the NYSE's CQS feeds.Exchanges profit by selling higher-capacity feeds to HFT traders, which disincents self-regulation that could prevent the quote stuffing. Quote stuffing happens frequently - when 6,000 replacement orders for one stock are crammed into a second, each order is valid for less time than <b>it</b> takes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of <b>the</b> order (traveling at close to the speed of light) to reach anyone not at the exchange; no normal person can execute a trade against the phantom order.|$|R

2500|$|Trotter {{started his}} search for Clifton in 1987. Almost 30 years later, in June 2016, {{he and his team}} logged the {{coordinates}} of an unknown wreck. He stated that they had been working on a project that involved two other wrecks. The team dived the unknown lost vessel in September 2016, and when the diver surfaced, he reported to Trotter that the unidentified vessel was [...] "a whaleback". Trotter instantly told his crew that they might well have discovered Clifton, as it was the only as-yet-undiscovered whaleback to have been lost on Lake Huron. The senior diver wanted additional confirmation of this discovery before making it public. [...] After deputizing several team members with action cameras, {{it was clear that the}} wreck was indeed a whaleback and was therefore Clifton. Trotter's divers further explored and video-documented the wreck, making nine dives in July–August 2017. Careful work was necessary, as the long-lost hull had been found approximately 100miles (160km) from where she had been last seen and was believed to have sunk. Trotter made the identification public in September 2017. The delay made <b>it</b> possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to be formally released on September 21, 2017, the 93rd anniversary of the vessel's last surface sighting. Trotter said that the discovery was [...] "a personal milestone" [...] in a quest that he was fortunate enough to complete within his lifetime.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} before Beric {{closed his eyes}} that night. The {{events of the day}} had been a {{complete}} surprise to him. He had thought that in the distant future he should share with his mother in the ruling of the tribe, but had never once dreamed of its coming <b>for</b> years. Had <b>it</b> not been <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that they had heard of the intended invasion of the Holy Isle he should not have regretted his elevation, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> would have given him the means and opportunity to train the tribesmen to fight in close order as did the Romans. But now he could not hope that there would be time to carry this out effectually. He knew that throughout Britain the feeling of rage and indignation at this outrage upon the gods of their country would raise the passions of men to boiling point, and that the slightest incident would suffice to bring on a general explosion, and he greatly feared that the result of such a rising would in the end be disastrous.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of the {{internet}} on the return to original reporting. I analyze the reporting of 727, 038 <b>news</b> stories in <b>the</b> largest print and online newspapers in Argentina over a twelve-year period. I estimate the extent to which readers dislike the delay in <b>the</b> reporting of <b>news.</b> Before <b>the</b> internet, publishing every news story with a one-day delay resulted in a 65 % readership reduction. In the internet era, the reduction rate is 61 % for print editions and 64 % for online editions. Readers dislike delays in <b>the</b> reporting of <b>news,</b> and <b>the</b> extent of this aversion has not changed with the internet. Next, I compute the delay the newspaper incurs when it is not the …rst to report a news story. Prior to the internet, the delay was, on average, 1. 15 days. Post-internet, the delay can theoretically go below 1 day and in fact it falls to 0. 83 days for print editions and 0. 52 days for online editions. Faster updating has reduced the rate of readership loss inherent in not being the …rst newspaper to report news, up to a 42 %. Finally, I examine whether the internet has an e¤ect on <b>the</b> time <b>it</b> takes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to be reported. I focus on the deaths of public …gures, a subset of <b>the</b> stories <b>for</b> which <b>the</b> time of the event is precisely de…ned. Post-internet, there is a 0. 07 day increase in the time taken to discover a death from the moment it occurred. However, there is also a 0. 19 day reduction in the time newspapers have to wait to publish a death after they …nd out about it...|$|R
40|$|When a {{disaster}} {{the magnitude of}} the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill takes place, is <b>it</b> natural <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media stories, investigative reports, and public deliberation to focus almost exclusively on finding the person or group responsible for such a horrendous scene. Rhetorically speaking, the discourse surrounding the event can be characterized as a reductive form of praise and blame rhetoric (epideixis). However, these efforts, while well-intentioned, are troublesome because searches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> one technical cause and the sole personal culpability are thwarted by the sheer complexity of the ecological, technological, scientific, institutional, and communicative network required for such {{a disaster}} to take place. Thus, to demonstrate the insufficiency of extant models of disaster in a variety of fields, which tend to privilege human-centered approaches, Dead Man 2 ̆ 7 s Switch: Disaster Rhetorics in a Posthuman Age explores the ontology, technical documentation, and rhetorical theory of disasters through a posthuman lens. To find a more critical approach to understanding the nature of disasters in the twenty-first century, I ask the following questions: How do rhetoricians and technical communicators account more fully <b>for</b> <b>the</b> human and nonhuman forces at work in the precipitation of disaster? How do rhetoricians and technical communicators find an approach to ecological catastrophe that goes beyond the mere 2 ̆ 2 environmentalist rhetoric 2 ̆ 2 characterizing the public response? Through the application of several posthumanist theories, my project develops an approach to disaster that complicates traditional ways of approaching causality and blame. I use accident reports, news media stories, and popular literature as data for this project. By examining these texts, my project has broad implications for technical communication, rhetorical theory, and philosophy of rhetoric...|$|R

40|$|The live blog is a {{relatively}} new, web-native format that has special possibilities <b>for</b> creating journalism. <b>It</b> {{is an example of}} networked journalism that puts an emphasis on aggregated material from different sources such as social media and user-generated content. • Live blogs are usually heavily dependent on other mainstream media as well as social media to function. • News consumers appreciate the format of the live blog. They sometimes prefer it over other formats such as a conventional news articles and sometimes consume types of content they would not normally have chosen because it is presented in a live blog. • The use of live blogs has sparked conflict and debate, mainly because of the speed at which they are written and how this leads to publishing unconfirmed information which has occasionally put people at risk of harm. • Live blogs change the way journalists work: they have more (or less) to do, they use a different tone of voice and they might not always be able to verify the information that they share. Reporters take on a new role, that sometimes might resemble that of an editor, curator or moderator. • Verifying facts in real time {{is one of the biggest}} journalistic challenges when working with live blogs. Other challenges include the live blog taking up a lot of resources and keeping the narrative structure clear. • Live blogs can be used as a way of engaging with readers, making <b>it</b> easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> - paper to receive useful user generated content. • Live blogs might change how media companies act towards news consumers and increase the level of engagement with readers. • Live blogs open up the journalistic process to readers, so transferring some of the jour - nalistic responsibility towards them. Live blogs change the way the reader consumes <b>the</b> <b>news</b> – <b>the</b> reader has to act like an editor. • The live blog is an evolving format that we will see more of in the future...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>news</b> {{media and}} <b>the</b> {{political}} public relations industry are linked in numerous ways and {{any change in}} their relationship has many repercussions, not just <b>for</b> those in <b>the</b> political <b>news</b> industry, but for society and democracy in the UK as a whole. Neither political PRs nor journalists can function effectively without the other and each relies upon the other to enhance their importance. They are both powerful groups but without the other their power is impaired {{and their ability to}} succeed is significantly reduced. The extent of this relationship on public life and society in the UK means that an analysis of these relationships is essential to understand just who the political gatekeeper is in the early 21 st century. This thesis utilises interviews with professional practitioners in <b>the</b> political <b>news</b> industry to investigate the role of political journalists within <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media and <b>the</b> role of political PRs in the political public relations industry. It then establishes the extent and nature of the relationship between these two groups. The implications of this relationship are then analysed to determine whether <b>it</b> is possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media to facilitate their role in democratic life in the UK. The thesis concludes that, as a result of all the changes in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media and <b>the</b> dramatic growth in size and power of the political public relations industry, {{there is no longer a}} single political gatekeeper and that in fact political PRs and journalists conduct a collusive conflictual relationship. It presents a situation where not only are journalists hindered in carrying out <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media's democratic obligations but <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media is, as a whole, no longer able to effectively defend their obligations and journalists are failing in their role as a watchdog.

The $450 million cost estimate is composed of $250 million to create Sentinel, plus another $200 million for 10 years of operations. In explaining the Foundation's current bypassing of possible governmental grants for such a mission, Dr. Lu stated their public fundraising appeal is being driven by [...] "the tragedy of the commons: When it’s everybody’s problem, it’s nobody’s problem", referring to a lack of ownership, priority and funding that governments have assigned to asteroid threats, also stating on a different occasion [...] "We’re the only ones taking it seriously." [...] According to another B612 board member, Rusty Schweickart, [...] "The good news is, you can prevent it — not just get ready <b>for</b> <b>it!</b> <b>The</b> bad <b>news</b> is, it's hard to get anybody to pay attention to it when there are potholes in the road." [...] After providing earlier Congressional testimony on the issue Schweickart was dismayed to hear from congressional staff members that, while U.S. lawmakers involved in the hearing understood the seriousness of the threat, they would likely not legislate funding for planetary defense as [...] "making the deflection of asteroids a priority might backfire in their reelection campaigns".|$|R
6000|$|I {{would have}} given {{something}} to have waited at table that day. But, in my position in the household, waiting at dinner (except on high family festivals) was letting down my dignity {{in the eyes of}} the other servants--a thing which my lady considered me quite prone enough to do already, without seeking occasions <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> <b>news</b> brought to me from the upper regions, that evening, came from Penelope and the footman. Penelope mentioned that she had never known Miss Rachel so particular about the dressing of her hair, and had never seen her look so bright and pretty as she did when she went down to meet Mr. Franklin in the drawing-room. The footman's report was, that the preservation of a respectful composure in the presence of his betters, and the waiting on Mr. Franklin Blake at dinner, were two of the hardest things to reconcile with each other that had ever tried his training in service. Later in the evening, we heard them singing and playing duets, Mr. Franklin piping high, Miss Rachel piping higher, and my lady, on the piano, following them as it were over hedge and ditch, and seeing them safe through it in a manner most wonderful and pleasant to hear through the open windows, on the terrace at night. Later still, I went to Mr. Franklin in the smoking-room, with the soda-water and brandy, and found that Miss Rachel had put the Diamond clean out of his head. [...] "She's the most charming girl I have seen since I came back to England!" [...] was all I could extract from him, when I endeavoured to lead the conversation to more serious things.|$|R
60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{this moment}} have your note; {{and as a}} packet of ours is going to England, I snatch up a pen to do what I can {{with it in the}} brief moments between this and post time. I don't wait till it shall be {{possible}} to write at length, because I have something immediate to say to you. Your letter is delightful, yet <b>it</b> is not <b>for</b> that that I rush so upon answering it. Nor even is <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> excellent <b>news</b> of your consenting, for dear Mr. Chorley's sake, to give us some more of your 'papers,'[203] though 'blessed be the hour, and month, and year' when he set about editing the 'Ladies' Companion' and persuading you to do such a thing. No, what I want to say is strictly personal to me. You are the kindest, warmest-hearted, most affectionate of critics, and precisely as such it is that you have thrown me into a paroxysm of terror. My dearest friend, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> love of me--I don't argue the point with you--but I beseech you humbly,--kissing the hem of your garment, and by all sacred and tender recollections of sympathy between you and me, don't breathe a word about any juvenile performance of mine--don't, if you have any love left for me. Dear friend, 'disinter' anybody or anything you please, but don't disinter me, unless you mean the ghost of my vexation to vex you ever after. 'Blessed be she who spares these stones.' All the saints know that I have enough to answer for since I came to my mature mind, and that I had difficulty enough in making most of the 'Seraphim' volume presentable a little in my new edition, because it was too ostensible before the public to be caught back; but if the sins of my rawest juvenility are to be thrust upon me--and sins are extant of even twelve or thirteen, or earlier, and I was in print once when I was ten, I think--what is to become of me? I shall groan as loud as Christian did. Dearest Miss Mitford, now forgive this ingratitude which is gratitude all the time. I love you and thank you; but, right or wrong, mind what I say, and let me love and thank you still more. When you see my new edition you will see that everything worth a straw I ever wrote is there, and if there were strength in conjuration I would conjure you to pass an act of oblivion on the stubble that remains--if anything does remain, indeed. Now, more than enough of this. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> rest, I am delighted. I am even so generous as not to be jealous of Mr. Chorley for prevailing with you when nobody else could. I had given it up long ago; I never thought you would stir a pen again. By what charm did he prevail? Your series of papers will be delightful, I do not doubt; though I never could see anything in some of your heroes, American or Irish. Longfellow is a poet; I don't refer to him. Still, whatever you say will be worth hearing, and the guide through 'Pompeii' will be better than many of the ruins. 'The Pleader's Guide' I never heard of before. Praed has written some sweet and tender things. Then I shall like to hear you on Beaumont and Fletcher, and Andrew Marvell.|$|R
