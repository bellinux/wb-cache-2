5000|$|AC Hazlet fall rye is to {{be planted}} in late August or early September {{to allow for the}} crop to grow 4-6 weeks before cold {{hardening}} and vernalization occurs due to the weather conditions. Fall rye should be sown on a field that has not been very recently tilled. AC Hazlet fall rye is normally seeded with a <b>hoe</b> <b>drill</b> or a minimum tillage drill, but in cases where these types of equipment may not be available, it is possible for the rye to be broadcast sown onto the field. An optimal seed depth of 1-1.5 inches is required for the best emergence results, the field should be lightly tilled after seeding to ensure the adequate seed depth and a packer wheel should be used to ensure seed-to-soil contact occurs and to enhance winter hardiness and establishment of the crop. As long as the AC Hazlet fall rye crop receives an adequate 4-6 week growth period before cold temperatures arise, the crop should survive well over the winter, as fall rye can tolerate temperatures as low as -35 °C without receiving much damage ...|$|E
40|$|Seed depth {{consistency}} is {{a critical}} performance metric of agricultural seeding equipment. To improve productivity, equipment manufacturers have historically focused on increasing the equipment working width of hoe-opener style seeding drills (hoe drills). However, the physical limitations of <b>hoe</b> <b>drill</b> size do present a design challenge. Increasing seeding speed to improve equipment productivity {{continues to be a}} challenge for equipment designers. Most operating conditions restrict hoe-drill seeding speeds to approximately 2. 2 m/s (5 mph); depth consistency generally degrades above this speed with current <b>hoe</b> <b>drill</b> technology. This research focused on developing an understanding of why this performance degradation occurs as speed increases. The general industry hypothesis points vaguely to "excessive motion" of the components to which the soil-engaging tools connect (the row units). However, little research on the dynamics of towed agricultural implements was found in the open literature. An understanding of the mechanism(s) causing this "excessive motion" was sought during this research. A 2 -D simulation tool was developed in MATLAB to provide equipment designers with the capability to conduct performance trade-off and sensitivity studies early in the prototype stage of a project. The simulation tool was compartmentalized so that changes to equipment geometry, component-soil contact models, or hydraulic systems could be modified with little or no change {{to other parts of the}} program. Operational data were also collected using a small plot drill based on a New Holland P 2070 Precision <b>Hoe</b> <b>Drill.</b> Data were collected at multiple operating speed up to 4. 4 m/s (10 mph) to characterize depth consistency issues present at higher speeds. Various geometric seed depth and hydraulic pressure settings were also tested. Kinematic parameters (acceleration, position), force, hydraulic pressure, and video of the instrumented row unit were recorded during steady-state the operation of the machine in typical seeding conditions. Measured data aided in calibrating aspects of the simulation tool, and the tool enabled certain performance features in the measurement data to be explored further. Frequency domain acceleration power spectra revealed that row unit acceleration power was generally concentrated at two frequencies. The terrain profile of the test field contained furrows from the previous seeding operation; this resulted in acceleration power to be concentrated at a distinct speed-dependent frequency related to the furrow spacing. While somewhat expected, this indicated the general inability of the current design to attenuate terrain inputs. The small packer wheel provided little compliance between the row unit and soil, so improving the attenuation performance of the system could improve depth consistency performance in future designs. The second major acceleration spectra feature was related to the arrangement of the hoe opener and trailing packer wheel; both rigidly connect to the row unit body. The row unit position changed when the packer wheel encountered a terrain bump or dip; this resulted in a change in the vertical position of the hoe opener located in front of the packer wheel. Immediate changes in the operating depth of the hoe opener tool resulted. Also, depth changes generally modified the terrain such that a new bump or dip was created in the soil surface preceding the packer wheel, thus creating a feedback path between the hoe opener and packer wheel. Considering the simplifications of the 2 -D model, agreement between simulated and measured data was encouraging. The frequencies of the above phenomena were in reasonable agreement throughout the speed range of interest. Power spectra amplitude differences were likely due to both input terrain differences between simulation and test terrains, and simplifications made in representing soil-tire and soil-tool contact. Future work to improve these sub-models, and to further explore the observed non-linear effect of hydraulic pressure changes would improve the predictive accuracy of the model presented...|$|E
40|$|The air seeding cart is an {{important}} piece of farming equipment used in the seeding process. Three factors which are necessary to monitor during the seeding process are the seeding rate (material mass flow rate), air flow rate, and blockages. In current practice, there are systems that monitor and report air flow and blockages but not the actual seeding rate. Presently, the seeding rate {{is based on the}} metering calibration before the seeding process starts, which requires {{a lot of time and}} energy from the operator. If that goes wrong, it not only takes longer, but also costs more money and increases the already significant stress and fatigue which farmers and operators have during the seeding period. Therefore, the development of reliable, and easily calibrated, on-line sensors for flow monitoring would be beneficial. Further, such sensors would facilitate closed-loop control of the flow rate itself. In order to develop a laboratory prototype for mass flow measurement, a model for mass flow estimation was established. This was accomplished by using pressure transducers to determine the pressure drop across an elevation in the primary air cart run (between the air seeding cart and the air <b>hoe</b> <b>drill).</b> An air seeding test station was designed and developed for the study. Three different types of seeds and a granular fertilizer were chosen and tested. These tested materials were canola, wheat, chickpea and urea fertilizer (46 - 0 - 0). The general form of the model was developed using data from the canola tests. The input parameters for this mass flow estimation model were pressure drop and air flow information. The average percent error of the material mass flow rate’s full range was under 10 %, except for the highest rate which tested up to 20 %. Overall, more than 75 % of the estimations had percent errors being less than 5 %. The form of the model was also applicable to other individual tested materials with the percent error of their full ranges up to 20 %. However, their average of their median error was around 5 % of their full ranges. The general model was also applied to the combined data from all tested materials. The results were not as accurate as when the model was applied to the individual tested material. The median of the percent error (of material mass flow rate full range) varied from as low as 1 % to as high as 30 %, depending on the tested materials. Nevertheless, it demonstrated that there were consistencies between the behaviour of the four tested materials...|$|E

50|$|While {{supported}} {{by a number of}} powerful patrons, Tull’s revolutionary claims regarding horse-hoeing husbandry and rejection of Virgilian, “Old” husbandry presented in The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry drew fire from a variety of critics as well. One of his most vehement dissenters was Stephen Switzer, a contemporary landscape gardener and leader of the Private Society of Husbandmen and Planters. Following the publication of The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: Or, An Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegetation in 1731, Switzer fiercely attacked Tull in the final two volumes of his own monthly publication, The Practical Husbandman and Planter, in 1734. He not only accused Tull of plagiarizing his technological inventions from others, namely the horse <b>hoe</b> and <b>drill,</b> but also attacked Tull for his criticism of farming techniques found in Virgil’s Georgics and his rejection of traditional, “Virgilian” husbandry.|$|R

40|$|Background Early in {{a season}} the crop covers only part of total field area. Treating that area uniformly can {{therefore}} be wasteful. An ability to differentiate between crop rows and inter-row spaces would provide opportunities for increased treatment efficacy, reduced environmental impact and reduced input costs. Banded treatments on, or between crop rows, requires a level of precision {{that is difficult to}} achieve in practice. So, despite the potential advantages inter-row cultivation and band spraying are limited to use in high value crops. Recent advances pioneered by some of the consortium partners now offer automatic guidance systems for inter-row cultivation. These are currently used in intensive vegetable production and by those growing cereals organically. They offer enhanced accuracy, higher forward speeds and reduced driver fatigue compared to manual systems. Whilst helpful, the science behind these developments has limitations with respect to work rate. In particular the need for inter-row <b>hoes</b> to match <b>drill</b> bout width makes such systems uneconomic for conventional cereal producers.
