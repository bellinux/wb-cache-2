5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed craft, and metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military. A good indication {{of the development of}} metalwork of this period is the Lovamahapaya, which had been roofed <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> copper.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> modular, readily available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the route}} east of New Haven is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> diesel locomotives. Once the full order of M8 railcars are in service, and Amtrak tests and approves the M8s for usage east of New Haven, ConnDOT {{plans to use}} 24 to 32 cars for electric SLE service to reduce diesel emissions. The diesel trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield.|$|E

She completed another {{tour of the}} western Pacific in late 1956 and early 1957, which was her tenth and final deployment to the area. In late 1957, the navy began experimenting {{with the concept of}} a carrier operating <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> attack helicopters, and Boxer was used to test the concept.|$|E
5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend Juste in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} decision, {{reached by}} a majority of four judges to three, was that the Migration Act did permit indefinite detention. Each judge delivered a separate judgment with Justices McHugh, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon forming the majority, although Justice Heydon agreed <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> Justice Hayne, and offered no extra reasoning. Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby dissented, finding instead that the Migration Act should not be interpreted to permit indefinite detention.|$|E

5|$|After the lackluster {{critical}} and commercial {{response to the}} first film, series creator Gene Roddenberry was {{forced out of the}} sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed its final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and this theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy had not intended to have a role in the sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production team used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniature models from past projects and reusing sets, effects footage, and costumes from the first film. Among the film's technical achievements is being the first feature film to contain a sequence created <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> computer-generated graphics.|$|E
5|$|Any {{model of}} the origin of Siletzia must account for {{interactions}} with plate boundaries that were being subducted under North America through the Eocene. Early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries, particularly of the Kula-Farallon (K-F) spreading ridge: basalts {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Alaska (along the Alaska panhandle) have ages and compositions corresponding to the Siletz volcanics, suggesting that the K-F ridge was offshore of the Yukon at the same time it was offshore of Washington. This can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 Ma the eastern part of the Kula plate had broken away to form the Resurrection plate, with the new Kula-Resurrection (K-R) spreading ridge running up the Gulf of Alaska towards Kodiak Island, and the former K-F (now R-F) ridge reaching Washington. Subduction of this plate under western Canada was rapid, and it disappeared <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> subduction of the K-R ridge about 50 Ma.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album Up in It, the band received $15,000 advance from Sub Pop to record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were hindered by Sub Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed <b>entirely,</b> <b>with</b> Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Every three months, the Trylon Cinema {{publishes a}} full {{schedule}} of screenings, approximately 10 {{percent of which}} are of first run films. The venue features a variety of regular exhibitions, ranging from the Trash Film Debauchery series of B movies, to the Defenders in which local cinephiles curate and defend screenings of personal favorite cult films, to Sound Unseen, a documentary project covering behind-the-scenes aspects of musicians' creative processes. The Trylon also hosts showcases of the films throughout various directors' careers. Take-Up Productions continues to use other venues such as the Heights and the Riverview for screenings necessitating larger houses. The Cinema is staffed almost <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith {{refused to let}} the other members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} now of the original three who had signed with Mercury). On top of that in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were stolen. The theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up to the audience.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae <b>entirely,</b> <b>with</b> its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Piemonte was {{a unique}} {{protected}} cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1880s by the British shipyard Armstrong Whitworth. She {{was the first major}} warship armed <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> quick-firing (QF) guns and she was also the fastest cruiser in the world upon her completion in 1889. Piemonte was frequently deployed overseas, including a lengthy tour in East Asian waters from 1901 to 1904. She saw significant action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 in the Red Sea, where she frequently bombarded Ottoman ports. During the Battle of Kunfuda Bay in January 1912, she and two destroyers sank four Ottoman gunboats and forced ashore three more. Piemonte participated in World War I but she saw little action during the conflict. She remained in service until 1920, when she was scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost <b>entirely,</b> <b>with</b> the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior <b>entirely</b> <b>with</b> giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E
