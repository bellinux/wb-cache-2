40|$|Introduction. The {{international}} Union for Health Promotion and Education highlights {{that developing}} a competent Health Promotion workforce {{is a key}} component of capacity building for the future and is critical to delivering on the vision, values and commitments of global Health Promotion" (1). Until now {{there is a lack of}} data to what extend health promotion education leads to health promotion practice both locally and globally. This master thesis is a report of an exploratory mixed method study discovering issues and challenges that graduates of the Norwegian programs of health promotion experience in the labour market. Methods. The study was performed in two steps, where the first one was an online questionnaire and the second step contained telephone interviews. Mixing methods allowed us to get an overview of what positions and type of contracts health promotion professionals are employed at, as well as get a deeper understanding of what it means to be a health promoter in various circumstances in Norway. The results of step 1 showed that the employment rate was about as high as after completing other study programs in Norway - 97 %, but in terms of relevance- only 65 % could say that they do health promotion/use health promotion education at current workplaces. Public health coordinator, advisor, leader and other similar positions are the ones where health promotion education is utilised the most- four of five respondents working at these positions marked that they use the education continuously or often. However, only half of them (59 %) had a permanent job contract. Other positions where health promotion graduates could utilise their education were: teachers, nurses, therapists and etc. But in these positions not everybody had possibilities to utilise their health promotion education. The main influencing factor to what extend health promotion graduates can use their education at work was the stakeholders (employers). The most challenging tasks at the current workplaces of health promoters were mostly related with project management and other administrative tasks. The interviews revealed high demand for the IUHPEs standards for health promotion education and wider spread of the competencies that it provides to the society. There is a need for better communication between <b>institutions</b> <b>providing</b> health <b>promotion</b> education and the job market. Conclusion. This study provides the wide angle picture of how health promotion is utilised in the labour market and identifies some issues that are influential in practice. Yet, this study aimed to give an overview of the current situation, and therefore can not provide a lot of details, but calls for further research on identified issues...|$|R
