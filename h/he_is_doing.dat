His wife, Aminah, enters, and asks him what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> When he answers that he is reading the newspaper, Aminah turns it right-side up and ridicules him.

25|$|An ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron {{rated the}} least popular {{of the three}} main party leaders. A YouGov poll on party leaders {{conducted}} on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> well and 50% thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> badly, whilst 38% thought <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> the best PM and 35% did not know. In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> badly.|$|R

5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E

50|$|It {{is not a}} defence {{that the}} {{defendant}} held an honest and reasonable belief that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> not criminal. Where the defendant is a foreigner, and the offence is not criminal in his own country, the fact of such a belief is still not a defence. It is not a defence that the defendant believed that <b>he</b> would not <b>be</b> prosecuted for what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R

5|$|The second plotline {{revolves}} around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), {{who lives with}} his sister Iris in California. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers {{the extent of his}} own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. Certain that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer.|$|E
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist {{knows exactly what}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> {{and that he has}} an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing,</b> and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that {{he knows that he}} is up to something, and says that he will be watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 meters from the prior location, with the original location still being used for staff meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} {{keep an eye on the}} chefs even while <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} outside of the television series in the novel Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> on the meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} meteor rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that she was really sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nurse Edwards (Vernee Watson-Johnson) confronts Preijers {{about an}} {{injection}} {{she saw him}} give Reyes; he kills Edwards to cover his tracks. Later, in the floating hospital, Stephen collapses and disappears when he too is pulled off of life support. After Doggett is spotted with Audrey in the basement by Preijers, he begins to worry that she could expose what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> He injects the same drug he used to kill Edwards, but Audrey is able to concentrate and move into the floating hospital one last time. She informs Reyes that her only way out is {{to jump into the}} void. Reyes does so and wakes up in her hospital bed moments before her organs are to be harvested. Doggett runs down to Audrey's room only to find that Preijers has killed her. Doggett manages to capture Preijers before he can escape.|$|E

This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E
5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from {{erstwhile}} Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses {{on the night of}} the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Chennai, Aras {{delivers}} Nalla's cheque {{to the union}} workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> there, to which Nalla replies that he was invited by Aras to the wedding. Nalla then persuades Padayatchi to sign the papers which will help the workers obtain a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant (Santhana Bharathi) to eliminate Nalla. Padayatchi's assistant, however, has {{a change of heart}} as he is about to kill Nalla. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to leave Chennai and stay as far away from Padayatchi as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.|$|E
