25|$|A {{ripple current}} is the RMS {{value of a}} {{superimposed}} AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{specified}} cycle parameters under maximal conditions include {{charge and}} <b>discharge</b> <b>current,</b> pulse duration and frequency. They are specified for a defined temperature range {{and over the}} full voltage range for a defined lifetime. They can differ enormously depending on the combination of electrode porosity, pore size and electrolyte. Generally a lower current load increases capacitor life and increases the number of cycles. This can be achieved either by a lower voltage range or slower charging and discharging.|$|E

30|$|At {{the same}} time, since the {{galvanic}} currents flowing inside the aerosol particles {{and the surface}} <b>discharge</b> <b>currents</b> flowing mainly outside the particles form closed current loops, the galvanic and <b>discharge</b> <b>currents</b> inside such current loops are exposed to a mutual repulsion which in turn can result in the displacement of the initial surface {{discharges into the air}} space in proximity {{to the surface of the}} aerosol particles.|$|R
50|$|LiPo packs {{also see}} {{widespread}} use in airsoft, where their higher <b>discharge</b> <b>currents</b> and better energy density compared to more traditional NiMH batteries has very noticeable performance gain (higher rate of fire). The high <b>discharge</b> <b>currents</b> do damage the switch contacts due to arcing (causing the contacts to oxidize and often deposit carbon), {{so it is}} advised to either use a solid-state MOSFET switch or clean the trigger contacts regularly.|$|R
25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{that the}} ball {{lightning}} explosion time is shorter, the total strength of the pre-explosive <b>discharge</b> <b>currents</b> can reach even greater values.|$|R

2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being discharged. It is defined as the <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> divided by the {{theoretical}} current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. [...] A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer uninterruptible power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{electrical}} model of cascaded, series-connected RC (resistor/capacitor) {{elements in the}} electrode pores, the internal resistance increases with the increasing penetration depth of the charge carriers into the pores. The internal DC resistance is time dependent and increases during charge/discharge. In applications often only the switch-on and switch-off range is interesting. The internal resistance Ri can be calculated from the voltage drop ΔV2 {{at the time of}} discharge, starting with a constant <b>discharge</b> <b>current</b> Idischarge.
