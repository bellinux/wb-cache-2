5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E

5000|$|The GE 44-ton {{switcher}} is a 4-axle {{diesel-electric locomotive}} built by General Electric between 1940 and 1956. It {{was designed for}} industrial and light switching duties, often replacing steam locomotives {{that had previously been}} assigned these chores. This locomotive's specific 44-short ton weight was directly related to one of the efficiencies the new diesel locomotives offered compared to their steam counterparts: reduced labor intensity. In the 1940s, the steam to diesel transition was in its infancy in North America, and railroad unions were trying to protect the locomotive fireman jobs that were redundant with diesel units. One measure taken to this end was the 1937 so-called [...] "90,000 Pound Rule" [...] : a stipulation that locomotives weighing 90000 lb [...] - [...] 45 short tons [...] - [...] or more required a fireman in addition to an engineer on common carrier railroads. Industrial and military railroads had no such stipulation. The 44-ton locomotive was born to skirt this requirement. Other manufacturers also built 44-ton switchers of center-cab configuration. 276 examples of this locomotive were built for U. S. railroads and industrial concerns, four were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Australia in 1944, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Canada, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Cuba, one was <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> the Dominican Republic, five were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> France, three were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> India, six were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, five were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Saudi Arabia, one was <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Sweden, two were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Trinidad, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Uruguay, and 57 were built for the U.

5|$|By 1913, Large Black had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985.
