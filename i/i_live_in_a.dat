2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle it with a little sense of humour. I also love a girl who appreciates darkness. I'm a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{this sense}} of the past makes the village houses into [...] "rare antiquities", he is [...] "the last of the good old renegades. All my friends are all middle class and grey, but <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum, so I'm okay." [...] Walter is [...] "fat and married", Davies remembers [...] "how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free" [...] and goes on believing that [...] "one day we'll be free". Like Johnny Thunder he has [...] "vowed that he would never, ever end up like the rest". His memory connect him to his ideals {{as well as his}} individuality, his creativity, his natural life, even if it leaves him [...] "appallingly out of sync with the times", in which the trend was to speak of {{sweeping}} away the entire social system, taking a nuanced view, [...] "preserving the old things", as well as [...] "protecting the new", yet still condemning the worst of the new – skyscrapers and office blocks – as well as the old. This theme would be further developed in the following album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire).|$|E

6000|$|... "Sorrow and {{happiness}} were mingled at first like darkness and light. For months <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dusk of feelings. But it was quiet. It was warm..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deceit is a stranger, as yet, to my soul; [...] I, still, am unpractised to varnish the truth: [...] Then, {{why should}} <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hateful controul? [...] Why waste, upon folly, {{the days of}} my youth? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} Egyptian, sadly, [...] "I see you are angry with me. Is it because <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree? Do {{forgive me for}} that dreadful lie." ...|$|R
50|$|First I was small, {{and round}} like a pearl;Then long and slender, as brave as an earl;Since, like <b>an</b> hermit, <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cell,And now, like <b>a</b> rogue, <b>in</b> the wide world I dwell.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{as regards}} actual living expenses, I have managed by a shrewd {{business}} stroke {{to acquire a}} small but sufficient income. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> boarding-house--true--but I contrive to keep the wolf away from its door--which, by the by, badly needs a lick of paint. Have {{you ever heard of}} Nervino?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you know," [...] said Bernard, [...] "everything surprises me. I am {{of a very}} conjectural {{habit of}} mind. All sorts of ideas come into my head, and yet when the {{simplest}} things happen I am always rather startled. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reverie, and I am perpetually waked up by people doing things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then you haven't any friends. It's {{different}} with me. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small country town, and everyone's my friend.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city {{which is}} now some twelve hours distant from the Atlantic seaboard.

60|$|When {{we reached}} Boston that October, I had a gill of Provincetown sand in my shoes, and at Concord {{there was still}} enough left to sand my pages for many a day; and I seemed to hear the sea roar, as if <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shell, for a week afterward.|$|R

6000|$|... "Settlements, boy! It is long sin' I took my {{leave of}} the waste and wickedness of the {{settlements}} and the villages.

6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} wonder, myself, who I am," [...] {{replied the}} many-legged young man; [...] "but, in reality, I am Tommy Kwikstep, and <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hollow tree that {{fell to the}} ground with age. I have polished the inside of it, and made a door at each end, and that's a very comfortable residence for me because it just fits my shape." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1939 she {{published}} her autobiography <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> democracy, {{the title}} {{of which has been}} seen as ironic. During the Second World War she produced patriotic fiction such as Enduring Adventure (1944). She also wrote short stories and some children's books and non-fiction but she increasingly turned to romantic novels, often with a hospital theme.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O hush, Tom, I {{can never}} be a lady--and I can't stand dawdling here--nor you neither. 'Tisn't right {{to want to be}} out of our station, though I do wish <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old castle, where the maidens worked tapestry, and heard minstrels, never had no stairs to scour. Come, give me my mats, and thank you kindly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{never like}} the {{vegetable}} garden," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "Except when I am hungry. Then I DO {{like to go}} {{and look at the}} nice little rows of onions and beets. But I love a flower garden.

6000|$|... "Oh, Marilla," [...] {{she exclaimed}} one Saturday morning, coming dancing {{in with her}} arms full of {{gorgeous}} boughs, [...] "I'm so glad <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn't it? Look at these maple branches. Don't {{they give you a}} thrill--several thrills? I'm going to decorate my room with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who can tell?" [...] she answered. [...] "A {{woman who}} lives well-nigh alone, as <b>I</b> <b>live,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet place, hears things {{so often that}} other folk never listen to. There's always {{something}} in my ears, night or day. Sometimes I am not sure whether it's in this world or the other. It was like that with me just then. It was for that reason I listened. Your luncheon's ready, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered. [...] "Everything goes wrong. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kind of gilded hell. I don't like {{my uncle}} and I loath {{the men he}} brings about the place. I have no friends, I {{scarcely}} know a woman intimately, I have troubles I can't tell you and--I am wretched. You are the only creature I have left to talk to, and I suppose that after this row you must go away too to make your living." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wrote the}} entire book {{not long after}} my brother died. It was like <b>an</b> obsession. <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tiny {{basement}} apartment in Columbia, Missouri, unemployed for a year. I didn't tell anyone what I was doing. It was a very private experience. I almost feel that the book wasn't so much written by me, but channeled through me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Every year, I spent <b>a</b> {{vacation}} <b>in</b> the monastery. There <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{atmosphere of}} prayer and penance. This austere life of the monks are very attracted to me, and every year I gladly returned to it. This opportunity to live among them, those days spent with them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> monastery and a prayer, {{it was for me}} a source of great happiness." ...|$|R
5000|$|By this time, Donahue's drug {{addiction}} and alcoholism had ruined him financially. One summer, he was homeless and <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Central Park. [...] "There was always somebody {{who could be}} amused by Troy Donahue," [...] he says. [...] "I'd meet them anywhere, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> park, street, party, <b>in</b> bed. <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bush <b>in</b> Central Park for one summer. I kept everything I had <b>in</b> <b>a</b> backpack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a broken}} man {{in mind and}} body. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of tension, always {{straining}} my ears for the hated sound, afraid to converse with my fellows for fear of exposing my dreadful condition to them, with no comfort or hope of comfort {{on this side of}} the grave. I should be willing. Heaven knows, to die, and yet as each 5th of October comes round, I am prostrated with fear because I do not know what strange and terrible experience may be in store for me.|$|E
60|$|The {{consideration}} of this ought to bind us all, {{rich and poor}} together, against those wicked writers of the newspapers who would inflame the poor against their friends, guardians, patrons, and protectors. Not only very few (I have observed that I know of none, though <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place as poor as most) have actually died of want, but we have seen no traces of those dreadful exterminating epidemics which, in consequence of scanty and unwholesome food, in former times not unfrequently wasted whole nations. Let us be saved from too much wisdom of our own, and we shall do tolerably well.|$|E
60|$|Dian and <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great palace {{overlooking}} the gulf. There is no glass in our windows, for {{we have no}} windows, the walls rising but a few feet above the floor-line, {{the rest of the}} space being open to the ceilings; but we have a roof to shade us from the perpetual noon-day sun. Perry and I decided to set a style in architecture that would not curse future generations with the white plague, so we have plenty of ventilation. Those of the people who prefer, still inhabit their caves, but many are building houses similar to ours.|$|E
5000|$|Writing on his Facebook profile page, Cox stated [...] "The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to a collection of fond memories and even invented ones, like my friendship with Ricky Wilson or the fact that <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> abandoned victorian autoharp factory. The way that we write and rewrite and edit our memories to be a digest version of what we want to remember, and how that's kind of sad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will gang a far way till't" [...] {{said the}} sexton of Hermitage, [...] "ye may tak {{my word for}} that; at least, I ken naething else that suld mak myself contemptible, and folk are far frae {{respecting}} me as they wad do if <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> twa-lofted sclated house. But as for the Ravenswoods, I hae seen three generations of them, and deil ane to mend other." ...|$|R
