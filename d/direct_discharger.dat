30|$|In this study, {{nitrogen}} dynamics were examined for a sewage-influenced coastal area in western Japan. The impact zone of sewage-derived nitrogen by <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of TSE {{was estimated to}} be 1 – 2  km from STPs in the study area. DIN uptake by phytoplankton as well as dilution by offshore seawater contributed to the decrease in sewage-derived nitrogen. However, the extent of the impact zone was shown to be controlled by tidal variation temporally and water temperature differences between TSE and seawater seasonally. These results also indicate that nitrogen supply via exchange between seawater and sediment pore water is another important source of nitrogen beyond the <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of TSE.|$|R
50|$|Piezoelectric <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> (PDD) plasma {{is a type}} of cold non-equilibrium plasma, {{generated}} by a <b>direct</b> gas <b>discharge</b> of a high voltage piezoelectric transformer. It can be ignited in air or other gases {{in a wide range of}} pressures, including atmospheric. Due to the compactness and the efficiency of the piezoelectric transformer, this method of plasma generation is particularly compact, efficient and cheap. It enables a wide spectrum of industrial, medical and consumer applications.|$|R
5000|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasmas {{that have}} {{attained}} any noteworthy industrial significance are those generated by DC excitation (electric arc), AC excitation (corona discharge, dielectric barrier <b>discharge,</b> [...] piezoelectric <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> and plasma jets {{as well as}} 2.45 GHz microwave microplasma).|$|R

50|$|Additionally, {{a code of}} {{practice}} has been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the planning and construction of new septic tanks, secondary treatment systems, septic drain fields and filter systems. <b>Direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of septic tank effluent into groundwater is prohibited in Ireland, while the indirect discharge via unsaturated subsoil into groundwater, e.g. {{by means of a}} septic drain field, or the <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> into surface water is permissible in accordance with a Water Pollution Act license. Registered septic tanks must be desludged by an authorized contractor at least once a year; the removed fecal sludge is disposed of, either to a managed municipal wastewater treatment facility or to agriculture provided that nutrient management regulations are met.|$|R
40|$|Riverine {{inputs and}} <b>direct</b> <b>discharges</b> to Norwegian seas in 2008 have been estimated, in {{accordance}} with the requirements of the OSPAR Commission. Nutrient inputs from both rivers and point sources (industry, sewage treatment plants and fish farming) have increased slightly compared to the previous four years. In some rivers, however, nutrient concentrations have decreased since 1990. The <b>direct</b> <b>discharges</b> of metals from industry and sewage treatment plants have decreased significantly in recent years, and there are also examples of reductions of metal loads in rivers. Copper discharges from fish farming have increased since 2000, but in several rivers the concentrations of copper have been reduced. Inputs of PCBs and the pesticide lindane are insignificant.

5000|$|Critics {{of waste}} water {{injection}} wells cite concerns {{relating to the}} injectate polluting receiving waters. [...] Most environmental engineering professionals, however, consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells {{to be the most}} cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatment. The only known alternatives to injection wells are <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of treated waste water to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation. <b>Direct</b> <b>discharge</b> does not disperse the water over a wide area; the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody. Extensive irrigation is often prohibitively expensive and requires ongoing maintenance and large electricity usage.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{categorize}} and examine the inputs of pollution into our marine ecosystems. Patin (n.d.) notes that generally there are three main types of inputs of pollution into the ocean: <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of waste into the oceans, runoff into the waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|The Peirce Island Pool {{is owned}} by the City of Portsmouth and serves {{approximately}} 19, 000 swimmers each summer. The pool was originally constructed in the 1930 s and updated in the 1970 s and again in the mid 1990 s. The pool’s 800, 000 gallons of water were cleaned through a rapid sand filter. The filter was then cleaned through a backwash process and that wastewater was discharged directly into the Piscataqua River {{which is part of the}} Great Bay Estuary. The City sought and was awarded funds through the New Hampshire Estuaries Project (NHEP) to eliminate the <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> to the River. The NHEP Workplan reference number for this project is 03 -A- 3. The goal of the Peirce Island Pool Discharge Elimination project was to remove the <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> of pool filter backwash that flows into the Piscataqua River...|$|R
40|$|Riverine {{inputs and}} <b>direct</b> <b>discharges</b> to Norwegian seas in 2009 have been {{estimated}} {{in accordance with}} the requirements of the OSPAR Commission. Due to the general lower water discharges in 2009 than in 2008, there was a reduction in all nutrient fractions in riverine loads in 2009. Long-term (1990 - 2009) trends show that nutrient loads have decreased in some Norwegian rivers, although nitrogen concentrations have increased in others. <b>Direct</b> <b>discharges</b> of nutrients from fish farming continue to increase. The riverine loads of all metals except mercury were lower in 2009 than in 2008. The copper discharges from fish farming continue to increase. Analyses of long term trends (1990 - 2009) in metal inputs showed that zinc and copper loads have been reduced in several rivers. Inputs of PCBs and the pesticide lindane in 2009 were insignificant.

40|$|In Norway, 16 % of the {{population}} lives in rural areas where centralized infrastructure for wastewater treatment is neither cost effective and nor sustainable due to topography and long distance to connect a treatment facility. There are 330, 000 small decentralized wastewater treatment plants in Norway and out of those 1, 500 plants are located in Kristiansand municipality. Eutrophication and fecal contamination in the recipients are the major cause of concern to wastewater disposal from such onsite systems. In order to avoid pollution in the wastewater recipients from such onsite treatment systems, City and Community department (By- og Samfunnsenheten) of Kristiansand municipality initiated a project to inspect and registration of all small onsite wastewater treatment systems in the locality. However {{in the first phase}} (June-August 2016), almost 500 treatment systems was surveyed and out of those 406 treatment systems are analyzed for this thesis through WebGIS model develop by NIBIO. The statistics of the survey shows that there are 183 soil infiltration systems, 91 septic tank with <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> to the recipients, 42 with no treatment and <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> to recipients and 18 package treatment plants out of total 406 plants. The WebGIS analysis shows that 262 kg of P, 3225 kg N and 4468 kg of TOC per year discharge to different recipients from these onsite systems. Septic tank with <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> to recipients, septic tank discharge terrain and sand filter systems significantly contributed to the overall total burden of the pollutants on the recipients. Only these three categories discharge 235 kg of P, 1709 kg N and 3442 kg TOC out of out of total pollutants 262 kg, 3225 kg and 4468 kg respectively. However, it is calculated that if septic tank with <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> to the recipients, septic tank effluent <b>discharge</b> to the <b>direct</b> terrain and sand filter systems are upgraded with new system, this may reduce 85 % P, 36 % N and 69 % of TOC. It is therefore, suggested that these systems replaced with new systems because they are significantly responsible for pollution in the recipients. Further, it is recommended that some older infiltration systems should be upgraded with bio-filter system depending on the feasibility...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of fecal coliform in aquatic environments {{may indicate that}} the water has been contaminated with the fecal material of humans or other animals.

50|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>discharge</b> {{of manure}} from CAFOs and the {{accompanying}} pollutants (including nutrients, antibiotics, pathogens, and arsenic) is a serious public health risk. The contamination of groundwater with pathogenic organisms from CAFOs can threaten drinking water resources, and the transfer of pathogens through drinking water contamination can lead to widespread outbreaks of illness. The EPA estimates that about 53% {{of people in the}} United States rely on groundwater resources for drinking water.|$|R
40|$|Results {{obtained}} from a dedicated radiochemistry cruise approximately 100 days after the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant show that Fukushima derived radionuclides in the nearby ocean environment had penetrated, on average, to ≤ 250 m depth (1026. 5 kg m 3 potential density surface). The excess inventory of Fukushima-derived 129 I in the region (∼ 150 000 km 2) sampled during the cruise is estimated to have been between 0. 89 and 1. 173 billion Bq (∼ 136 to ∼ 179 grams) of 129 I. Based on a tight tracer–tracer relation with 134 Cs (or 137 Cs) and estimates {{that most of the}} excess cesium is due to <b>direct</b> <b>discharge,</b> we infer that much of the excess 129 I is from <b>direct</b> (non-atmospheric deposition) <b>discharge.</b> After taking into account oceanic transport, we estimate the <b>direct</b> <b>discharge,</b> i. e., that directly released into the ocean, off Fukushima to have been ∼ 1 kg 129 I. Although this small pulse is dwarfed by the ~ 90 kg of weapons-testing-derived 129 I that was released into the environment in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, {{it should be possible to}} use Fukushima-derived 129 I and other radionuclides (e. g., 134, 137 Cs) to study transport and entrainment processes along and across the Kuroshio Current...|$|R
