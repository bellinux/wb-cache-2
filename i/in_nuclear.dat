40|$|We {{have used}} the {{glycoprotein}} gB of herpes simplex virus type 1 (gB- 1), which buds from the inner nuclear membrane, as a model protein to study localization of membrane proteins <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. To determine whether specific domains of gB- 1 glycoprotein are involved in localization <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope, we have used deletion mutants of gB- 1 protein as well as chimeric proteins constructed by replacing the domains of the cell surface glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus with the corresponding domains of gB. Mutant and chimeric proteins expressed in COS cells were localized by immunoelectron microscopy. A chimeric protein (gB-G) containing the ectodomain of gB and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of G did not localize <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. When the ectodomain of G was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gB, however, the resulting chimeric protein (G-gB) was localized <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. Substitution of the transmembrane domain of G with the 69 hydrophobic amino acids containing the membrane anchoring domain of gB allowed the hybrid protein (G-tmgB) to be localized <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope, suggesting that residues 721 to 795 of gB can promote retention of proteins <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. Deletion mutations in the hydrophobic region further showed that a transmembrane segment of 21 hydrophobic amino acids, residues 774 to 795 of gB, was sufficient for localization <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. Since wild-type gB and the mutant and chimeric proteins that were localized <b>in</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope were also retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, the membrane spanning segment of gB could also influence retention in the endoplasmic reticulum.
