2500|$|A few {{examples}} will illustrate {{this difference in}} the method of <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> the older and the younger Halakah. It was a generally accepted opinion that the first Passover celebrated in Egypt, that of the Exodus, differed from those that followed it, in that at the first one the prohibition of leavened bread was for a single day only, whereas at subsequent Passovers this restriction extended to seven days. The older halakha (in Mek., Bo, 16 [...] ), represented by R. Jose the Galilean, bases its interpretation on a different division of the sentences in Ex. xiii. than the one generally received; connecting the word [...] "ha-yom" [...] (= [...] "this day"), {{which is the first}} word of verse 4, with verse 3 and so making the passage read: [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten this day." [...] The younger halakha reads [...] "ha-yom" [...] with verse 4, and finds its support for the traditional halakha by means of the principle of [...] "semukot" [...] (collocation); that is to say, the two sentences, [...] "There shall no leavened bread be eaten," [...] and [...] "This day came ye out," [...] though they are separated grammatically, are immediately contiguous in the text, and exert an influence over each other (Pes. 28b, 96b). What the older halakha regarded as the obvious meaning of the words of the text, the younger infers from the collocation of the sentences.|$|E

See also Walter Bagehot's Economic Studies.] and in this Utopia deserves perhaps a word or so more. I write with the utmost diffidence, because upon earth economic science has been raised to a very high level of tortuous abstraction by the industry of its professors, and I can claim neither a patient student's intimacy with their productions nor--what is more serious--anything but the most generalised knowledge of what their Utopian equivalents have achieved. The vital nature of economic issues to a Utopia necessitates, however, some attempt at <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E

60|$|There is {{for example}} this {{practical}} identity of religious feeling and this discrepancy of <b>interpretation</b> <b>between</b> such an inquirer as myself and a convert of the Salvation Army. Here, clothing itself in phrases {{and images of}} barbaric sacrifice, of slaughtered lambs and fountains of precious blood, a most repulsive and incomprehensible idiom to me, and expressing itself by shouts, clangour, trumpeting, gesticulations, and rhythmic pacings that stun and dismay my nerves, I find, the same object sought, release from self, and the same end, the end of identification with the immortal, successfully if perhaps rather insecurely achieved. I see God indubitably present in these excitements, and I see personalities I could easily have misjudged as too base or too dense for spiritual understandings, lit by the manifest reflection of divinity. One may be led into the absurdest underestimates of religious possibilities if one estimates people only coldly and {{in the light of}} everyday life. There is a sub-intellectual religious life which, very conceivably, when its utmost range can be examined, excludes nothing human from religious cooperation, which will use any words to its tune, which takes its phrasing ready-made from the world about it, as it takes the street for its temple, and yet which may be at its inner point in the directest contact with God. Religion may suffer from aphasia and still be religion; it may utter misleading or nonsensical words and yet intend and convey the truth. The methods of the Salvation Army are older than doctrinal Christianity, and may long survive it. Men and women may still chant of Beulah Land and cry out in the ecstasy of salvation; the tambourine, that modern revival of the thrilling Alexandrine sistrum, may still stir dull nerves to a first apprehension of powers and a call beyond the immediate material compulsion of life, when the creeds of Christianity are as dead as the lore of the Druids.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} oral myth {{there are many}} {{different}} <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> the different storytellers. As the storyteller adds his own story to the tale, he will usually emphasize certain parts so that it will seem more relevant to the point he is trying to make.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a system AID (Alogtime Inductive Definitions) of bounded arithmetic. The main feature of AID {{is to allow}} a form of inductive definitions, which was extracted from Buss' propositional consistency proof of Frege systems F. We show that AID proves the soundness of F, and conversely any Σ^b_ 0 -theorem in AID yields boolean sentences of which F has polysize proofs. Further we define Σ^b_ 1 -faithful <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> AID + Σ b^_ 0 - CA and a quantified theory QALV of an equational system ALV in P. Clote. Hence ALV also proves the soundness of F...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} general study of graded {{consequence}} (of many-valued logic) {{in an institution}} theoretic (in the sense of Goguen and Burstall) style. This means both syntax and semantics are considered fully abstract, {{as well as the}} satisfaction between them. Our approach contrasts to other approaches on many-valued logic in that it is a multi-signature one, in the spirit of institution theory. We consider graded consequence at three different conceptual levels: entailment, semantic, and closure operators, and explore several <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> them. We also study logical connectors and quantifiers both at the entailment and semantic level, compactness and soundness properties. 1...|$|R
30|$|As given above, many {{classification}} {{systems for}} discourse relations {{had been established}} and experiments on different aspects of discourse relations were carried out. The proposed systems were proven to be sound. Unfortunately, hardly any previous mentioned systems meet the uniqueness criterion, since {{it is almost impossible}} to achieve mutually exclusivity for all relations. We agree that multi-relation <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> CPCs do exist but to achieve a unique annotation scheme which is also in line with the procedure of human understanding, i.e., always select the best interpretation among many possibilities. Therefore, our semantic relation system adopts a feature-based decision-making methodology described below to achieve the best labeling.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{extend the}} {{traditional}} notion of specification based on theories and <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> theories to model situations, typical of open, reactive systems, in which properties exhibited locally by an object no longer hold when that object is interconnected {{as a component}} of a larger system. The proposed notion of specification is based on the observation, due to Winskel, that while some assertions are preserved across morphisms of labelled transition systems, other are reflected. The distinction between these two classes of assertions leads us to the definition of two categories of specifications, one that supports horizontal structuring and another that supports vertical structuring, for which compositionality is proved. ...|$|R

In this paper, I argue that at least Czech CN is different. I argue that its semantics targets both at-issue meaning and focus alternatives. The evidence will come from differences in <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> English and Czech with respect to negated comparatives adjoined to NPs (like no more than two people) and from many other types of negated constituents. I argue that the cross-linguistic variation can be explained if Slavic CN is treated as a focus-oriented particle, unlike English no which targets scalar alternatives...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the method of}} forcing in set theory and focuses on aspects that are set aside in the usual presentations or applications of forcing. It is shown that forcing can be formalized in Peano arithmetic (PA) and that consis- tency results obtained by forcing are provable in PA. Two ways are presented of overcoming the assumption {{of the existence of}} a countable transitive model. The thesis also studies forcing as a method giving rise to <b>interpretations</b> <b>between</b> theories. A notion of bi-interpretability is defined and a method of forcing over a non-standard model of ZFC is developed in order to argue that ZFC and ZF are not bi-interpretable. ...|$|R
