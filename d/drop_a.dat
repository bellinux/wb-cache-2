5|$|Originally, dubstep {{releases}} {{had some}} structural {{similarities to other}} genres like drum and bass and UK garage. Typically this would comprise an intro, a main section (often incorporating a bass <b>drop),</b> <b>a</b> midsection, a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an outro.|$|E

The victory was Murray's first doubles title and the second time he had reached a final with his brother.|$|E
5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum <b>Drop,</b> <b>a</b> gigantic gumball machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E

5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first <b>drop,</b> <b>a</b> Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a few seconds, the train is released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen {{truck is}} intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing {{the man to}} <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, del Potro {{reached his}} first senior singles final at the Futures tournament in Berimbau Naucalpan, Mexico, where he lost to Darko Madjarovski. He {{then went on to}} win {{consecutive}} titles at two Future ITF Circuit events in Santiago, Chile, including the 26th International Junior tournament. In the first tournament, he beat Jorge Aguilar, and in the second, he did not <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> set in the whole tournament and defeated Thiago Alves in the final, a player ranked more than 400 places higher at the time. He won his third title in his home country by defeating Damian Patriarca, who forfeited the match, at the ITF Circuit event in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the <b>drop.</b> <b>A</b> poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, he and Martin won doubles titles at USTA Futures {{events in}} Costa Mesa, California, McAllen, Texas, and Harlingen, Texas (without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set).

5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{started his}} clay-court {{campaign}} of 2012 in the Davis Cup Quarterfinals against Croatia. He {{won his first}} rubber against Ivo Karlović and then demolished Marin Čilić in the reverse singles. He continued his clay-court season at the Estoril Open, {{where he was the}} defending champion and the top seed. He did not <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> set en route to the finals, where he beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet in straight sets in the final to collect his 11th ATP World Tour title. He next competed in the Madrid Masters as the twelfth seed and defeated Florian Mayer, Mikhail Youzhny, Marin Čilić, Alexandr Dolgopolov, but lost to Tomáš Berdych in the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use on the nuclear bomb missions, The Great Artiste was flown by five different crews on 12 training and practice missions. It flew bombing missions against Rota on 4 July, Truk on 8 July, and Marcus on 9 July. It returned to bomb Rota again on 12 and 14 July, and bombed Guguan on 18 and 19 July. It was flown by Albury and crew C-15 on two combat missions, {{one of which was}} aborted, and the other in which it used a pumpkin bomb to attack the railroad yards at Kobe on 24 July. Captain Bob Lewis and crew B-9 flew it to <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> pumpkin bomb on an industrial target in Koriyama on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|Raonic again {{achieved}} {{success at}} ATP 250 and ATP 500 events. In February, Raonic earned his third consecutive title at the Pacific Coast Championships, defeating Tommy Haas in the final. Over three years, he achieved a perfect 12–0 match record, {{and did not}} <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> single set. He is {{the only man in}} the Open Era to win three consecutive titles at this event. In September, he won the Thailand Open tournament, defeating No. 9 Gasquet in the semifinals and No. 6 Berdych in the final. The titles were Raonic's fourth and fifth, both coming in ATP 250 events like previous titles. In October, Raonic reached the Japan Open final for the second consecutive year, but lost a close match to No. 7 Juan Martin del Potro. It marked his fourth consecutive loss in the final of an ATP 500 event.|$|E

5000|$|When a word is vocalically apocopated, {{with the}} sound lost {{at the end of}} the word, and ends in a {{consonant}} group of a continuant plus a voiceless stop, it then goes through consonantic apocope and so the word-final consonant is lost. A voiceless stop between /h/ and another voiceless stop is <b>dropped.</b> <b>A</b> voiceless stop after any continuant except /h/ is <b>dropped.</b> <b>A</b> consonant group of /h/ followed by a voiceless stop is <b>dropped</b> if <b>a</b> continuant follows.|$|R
