5|$|On 6 June, {{several weeks}} after President Suharto resigned, Sudarmo was ousted from his office after {{students}} conducted a sit-in at the Bantul Assembly House. He was soon convicted of corruption for his payment to the Dharmais Foundation, but the conviction was overturned by a higher court, after which Sudarmo retired. Wuryanto never served time for <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> of Udin's blood.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the regular}} fullbacks in 2006, Hudghton conceded fewest goals. While <b>his</b> <b>{{disposal}}s</b> average of 10 was below average for a defender, Hudghton's disposal efficiency of 90% was elite. With only 32 marks from opposition kicks {{in the past}} two years, he prefers to spoil and in 2006 he effected the fourth-most spoils in the league.|$|R
60|$|Sir Terence {{placed the}} {{hospitality}} of his table at <b>his</b> lordship's <b>disposal.</b> But the latter declined graciously.|$|R
5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|E

5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> a {{formidable}} force. His main {{force on the}} left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied down around Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am sure he will," [...] said Sir Lionel, who {{certainly}} had just cause for such confidence, seeing how large a slice {{out of the}} sum had been placed at <b>his</b> own <b>disposal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Colonel Kekewich's troops {{consisted}} of four companies of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, some Royal Engineers, six RML 2.5 inch mountain guns and two machine guns. Also at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> were 120men of the Cape Police (recalled from various outposts along the railway line), 2,000irregular troops, the Kimberley Light Horse, and {{a battery of}} obsolete seven-pounder guns. Eight Maxim machine guns were mounted on redoubts built atop tailing heaps around the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1835 {{an act of}} Parliament {{reformed}} {{the local}} government structure, introducing a new town corporation structure with an elected mayor for the first time. Bute had {{to work harder to}} maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various levers of influence at <b>his</b> <b>disposal.</b> He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests.|$|E
5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realized}} the potential {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions at <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.|$|E
50|$|It {{was with}} Fitzroy {{that he made}} his AFL debut, in round 17 of the 1991 season, against Melbourne at the MCG. He had kicked a goal and a behind from <b>his</b> three <b>disposals.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 23rd Division (South Vietnam) {{under the}} command of Brigadier General Tran Van Cam was the main unit {{defending}} Ban Me Thuot and the surrounding areas. Major General Pham Van Phu had at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> five artillery battalions equipped with 146 artillery guns, and one armoured brigade of about 117 tanks and armoured vehicles. The South Vietnamese military also stationed air force and naval units in Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{a variety of}} elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. At <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> Jones has TNT, guns, swords, hats for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic whip. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands {{in any of the}} lava pits, crashes a mine cart or hits a boulder or spike trap, he loses one life.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{orders from}} Empress Elizabeth, Saltykov moved on Prussia in a methodical advance {{beginning}} in June 1759. Some estimates place his army {{as high as}} 70,000 men; others suggest he had approximately 41,000 in June and July. Upon learning of this advance, Frederick ordered General Dohna to halt the Russian westward advance. Dohna had a force of 26,000 at <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> including several companies of cavalry.|$|E
50|$|During 2011 Shaun Burgoyne played {{excellent}} {{football for}} Hawthorn, showcasing <b>his</b> silky <b>disposal</b> and hard running. He {{was part of}} a side that was unlucky to lose a preliminary final to eventual runners up Collingwood by 3 points.|$|R

50|$|The Kangaroos gave up one {{first-round pick}} for the then-26-year-old Hay. Hay debuted with the Kangaroos in 2006 and made several simple skill errors, with many {{commentators}} bemoaning his constant turnovers {{to the opposition}} and <b>his</b> poor <b>disposal</b> in defence.|$|R
5|$|Using his {{responsibility}} for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat as a pretext, Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> comprised the 5th SS-Polizei Regiment, minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.|$|E
5|$|Having drilled {{his army}} {{for two years}} Corbulo, despite this misadventure, was ready. He had three legions at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> (III Gallica and VI Ferrata from Syria and IV Scythica), to which were added {{a large number of}} {{auxiliaries}} and allied contingents from Eastern client kings like Aristobulus of Lesser Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus. The situation was furthermore favorable to the Romans: Vologases faced a serious revolt by the Hyrcanians in the region of the Caspian Sea as well as incursions of Dahae and Sacae nomads from Central Asia, and was unable to support his brother.|$|E
5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|Redden also polled {{his first}} Brownlow Medal vote this year, the award which rewards the AFL's fairest and best player. Redden polled {{the vote in}} <b>his</b> 27 <b>disposal,</b> 2 goal and 12 tackle effort v St Kilda in round 5.|$|R

25|$|McLeod {{started the}} first two games of the year at half forward but played {{the rest of the year}} as a small, running defender with great success. He {{increased}} <b>his</b> average <b>disposals</b> from 10 to 16 and increased his average marks from 1 a game to 3.|$|R
5|$|In August 1942, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander SWPA, {{replaced}} Lieutenant General Brett with Major General (later General) George Kenney. Kenney created two new formations {{subordinate to}} Allied Air Forces Headquarters: the US Fifth Air Force and RAAF Command. Bostock {{was chosen to}} be Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, with twenty-four Australian squadrons at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> plus one each from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under Bostock's command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF (No. 9 OG), controlled by Fifth Air Force. RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and conducting operations against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at <b>his</b> <b>disposal,</b> and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|In November 1871, New York Collector and {{a member}} of New York Senator Roscoe Conkling's {{political}} machine, was forced to resign. Murphy, a Grant appointee, had become embroiled in a dispute with another faction of the Republican party over the jobs at <b>his</b> <b>disposal</b> and was investigated by Congress for mismanagement and corruption in office. In December, Grant appointed Chester A. Arthur, another Conkling man, to replace Murphy, and administration of the Customs House steadily improved. On March 3, 1873, Grant signed into law a congressional and presidential salary increase. The unpopular Salary Grab Act was repealed in December, although Grant was allowed to keep his pay raise.|$|E
50|$|Wingard {{made his}} debut for Port Adelaide in Round 1, 2012 against St Kilda. His {{breakout}} game came during Port Adelaide's round 22, 2012 {{loss to the}} Brisbane Lions where he received an AFL Rising Star nomination for <b>his</b> 27 <b>disposal,</b> 1 goal and 5 mark performance.|$|R
