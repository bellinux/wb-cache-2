5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|The bridge carries 6 {{lanes of}} the North–South Elevated Road, a major <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> in the city, with 3 lanes in each direction. From Pudong, motorists can access the Lupu Bridge from on-ramps to the North–South Elevated Road {{westbound}} on Yaohua Road or northbound on Jiyang Road. The North–South Elevated Road actually ends {{immediately after the}} Lupu Bridge and becomes Jiyang Road, with an off-ramp to eastbound Yaohua Road.|$|E
25|$|Between 2001 and 2005 Boise Airport was remodeled. The airport {{now has a}} new {{terminal}} and an <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> for departures. There were two phases in building the {{new terminal}}. Phase 1 considered amenities such as baggage claim, lobby, and food and beverage concession, which were completed in 2003. Phase 2 dealt with security checkpoints and a new concourse (Concourse C) and the remodeling of Concourse B, which were completed in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Expanding and {{extending}} existing key roadways and improving existing urban roads and intersections {{as well as}} building <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> from New Kelani Bridge to Colombo Fort area, the Port and Battaramulla Flyovers are also being built as an interim solution for traffic congestion.|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} some {{dedicated}} <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> {{as well as}} dedicated lanes on bridges which allow buses to reach speeds of 60 km/h. Due to its success, the city has won honors as the China's top transportation city for six years running with more than 30% of trips taken by public transport.|$|R
50|$|Bridges usually {{require a}} larger {{footprint}} on each shore than tunnels. In areas with expensive real estate, such as Manhattan and urban Hong Kong, {{this is a}} strong factor {{in favor of a}} tunnel. Boston's Big Dig project replaced <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity, hide traffic, reclaim land, redecorate, and reunite the city with the waterfront.|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} is to {{construct}} foundations of the large columns that will support the <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The next step is to build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, the Loma Prieta {{earthquake}} {{damaged the}} northern part of the <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway,</b> and in 1992 Caltrans removed the freeway north of Fell Street and rerouted U.S. 101 to exit at Mission Street and onto the portion of Van Ness Avenue between the Central Freeway and Turk Street/Golden Gate Avenue. That year the Board of Supervisors banned any new freeway construction north of Market Street; a city task force recommended its replacement with a surface boulevard in 1995. Caltrans closed the double-deck freeway north of Mission Street for rebuilding in late 1996.|$|E
25|$|The Yerba Buena Island Transition Structure (YBITS) is an <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> that bridges the gap {{from the}} SAS span to the Yerba Buena Island tunnel. Much like the Oakland Touchdown {{on the other}} side of the new bridge, this section of the bridge is also an end segment, meaning that the purpose of this segment is to {{transition}} portions of the existing bridge to the main spans of the new bridge. The connecting structure transitions the new bridge's side-by-side roadways to the upper and lower decks of the YBI tunnel. In mid-February 2012, the northern structure has been poured and formwork was being removed. In early September 2012, the falsework had been removed, modified, and constructed at the eastbound location with formwork completion now allowing reinforcing and concrete placement.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a {{significant}} amount of Corktown was demolished to make way for several <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways,</b> including the Richmond Street off-ramp from the Don Valley Parkway and the re-routed Eastern Avenue overpass.

50|$|Late in 1934 Whyte {{pressed the}} Air Ministry to {{guarantee}} that the air services were sufficient to protect the Navy against air attacks. He also joined with other Conservative MPs in putting down {{an amendment to the}} Loyal Address after the King's Speech which called for the construction of <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> in major cities to relieve road congestion. Whyte decided not to seek re-election at the 1935 general election.|$|R
25|$|The {{final section}} of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the {{motorway}} meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s {{would have seen the}} motorway continue through the junction on an <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern {{section of the}} London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the Staples Corner junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.|$|E
25|$|The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), known unofficially as the Big Dig, was a {{megaproject}} in Boston that rerouted the Central Artery of Interstate 93, {{the chief}} highway {{through the heart}} of the city, into the 3.5-mile (5.6km) Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel. The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge over the Charles River, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway in the space vacated by the previous I-93 <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway.</b> Initially, the plan was also to include a rail connection between Boston's two major train terminals. Planning began in 1982; the construction work was carried out between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007 when the partnership between the program manager and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ended.|$|E
25|$|Past the Schuylkill River, I-95 {{continues}} east into South Philadelphia as {{an elevated}} freeway, passing {{south of the}} Philadelphia Sports Complex and north of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, interchanging with Pennsylvania Route 611 (Broad Street). The road curves north, following the bend in the Delaware River, and runs along the waterfront, interchanging with Interstate 76 west of the Walt Whitman Bridge. The <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> gradually lowers to a depressed level approaching Center City, where it passes through several short tunnels at Penn's Landing, passes under the Ben Franklin Bridge, and interchanges with the Vine Street Expressway (Interstate 676 and U.S. Route 30). North of Center City, the SEPTA Market–Frankford Line rises from the Market Street subway into I-95's median as the highway returns to an elevated alignment, entering one station (Spring Garden) before diverging once more. I-95 continues through Northeast Philadelphia, interchanging with the Betsy Ross Bridge and Pennsylvania Route 73 at the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge before crossing the county line into Bucks County.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> are {{typically}} built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become {{disconnected from the}} rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Along with Beckton Park, Cyprus {{station is}} of an unusual design. Between the two {{stations}}, the DLR runs in the median of a major road built {{at the same time}} as the railway. The stations are located at highway intersections which take the form of roundabouts. On the approach to the roundabout, the road rises slightly whilst the railway dips slightly; the station is therefore situated in a cutting, under the centre of the elevated roundabout, with pedestrian access at surface level under the <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> and arched over the railway.|$|R
50|$|The Mendelson Building {{occupies}} most of {{the block}} {{on the west side}} of Broadway between Fourth Avenue and Vine Street. To the east, between Broadway and the Hudson River, are parking lots, vacant land and another large building. Two other industrial buildings, of a similar size and shape but not as old, are to the north. A modern warehouse is on the south. On the west are railroad tracks used by CSX and the <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> of Interstate 787, dividing the waterfront from the residential neighborhoods of the South End.|$|R
25|$|The Oakland Touchdown is {{a curved}} <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> {{that connects the}} skyway to the Oakland shore (the {{beginning}} of the bridge). The curve is required to bring the alignment {{to that of the}} existing ground-level approach road. Like the Yerba Buena Island Transition Structure (YBITS) {{to the west of the}} main span, this section is also an end segment of the new bridge and is being constructed at the same pace as the YBITS. The construction process consists of two phases, the first phase already completed (westbound traffic side). The eastbound touchdown could not be completed until the existing roadway was out of the way. This was done by constructing a gentle swing to the south so that the touchdown may be completed. The first stage of this work was to move the eastbound traffic to the south was completed with only minor traffic delays during the 2011 Memorial Day holiday (May 28–30). The driving experience has been improved, without the problems that came with the infamous S-curve. A second stage to move the westbound traffic into the space made available required the construction of an elevated approach. This was completed on February 19, 2012. This recently designed procedure is expected to save time in the total effort, speeding the completion of the span. The Oakland Touchdown was completed in March 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Northridge Meadows {{apartment}} complex {{was one of}} the well-known affected areas in which sixteen people were killed {{as a result of the}} building's collapse. The Northridge Fashion Center and California State University, Northridge also sustained very heavy damage—most notably, the collapse of parking structures. The earthquake also gained worldwide attention because of damage to the vast freeway network, which serves millions of commuters every day. The most notable of this damage was to the Santa Monica Freeway, Interstate 10, known as the busiest freeway in the United States, congesting nearby surface roads for three months while the freeway was repaired. Farther north, the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 (the Golden State Freeway) and State Route 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway) collapsed as it had 23 years earlier in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake even though it had been rebuilt with minor improvements to the structural components. One life was lost in the Newhall Pass interchange collapse: LAPD motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean fell 40 feet from the damaged connector from southbound 14 to southbound I-5 along with his motorcycle. Because of the early morning darkness, he likely did not realize that the <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> below him had collapsed, and was unable to stop in time to miss the fall and died instantly. When the interchange was rebuilt again one year later, it was renamed the Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange in his honor.|$|E
25|$|In July 1953, {{prior to}} the {{formation}} of Metro Toronto, the Metropolitan Executive Committee, chaired by Fred Gardiner, ordered the planning of the Lakeshore Expressway as a four-lane or six-lane expressway from the Humber in the west to Woodbine Avenue in the east. The cost was estimated at 20 million dollars. Route planning was given to the engineering firm Margison Babcock and Associates, with the proviso that an American firm expert in expressway building would be involved. Margison's plan was delivered in April 1954. The roadway was to be constructed in the Sunnyside area and CNE grounds to the south of the present Lake Shore Boulevard. South of the CNE grounds, the route would be on lands created from infilling of the shoreline to the breakwaters and an interchange was proposed in front of the Prince's Gate. East of the CNE grounds, the highway would be an <b>elevated</b> <b>roadway</b> above the existing Fleet Street, to just west of the Don River. The highway proceeded at grade from that point eastward, ending at Coxwell Avenue and Queen Street East. Interchanges were proposed for Jameson Avenue, Strachan Avenue, Spadina Avenue, York Street, Jarvis Street, Don Roadway, Carlaw Avenue, Keating Avenue (the present Lake Shore Boulevard East) and Coxwell Avenue. The cost was then estimated at $50 million. The plan also proposed extending Queen Street westwards through High Park to west of the Humber River to connect with the Queensway and extending Keating Avenue east to Woodbine Avenue.|$|E

This portion would include junctions with the Mission Freeway (south and southwest along Mission Street to Daly City) at the southwest corner and the Panhandle Freeway (west through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park) along the west side. After swinging northeast and back north to {{the east side of}} Van Ness Avenue (continuing as a double-decked structure between Van [...] Ness Ave. and Polk Street), a pair of ramps would split to the east, taking downtown traffic to and from the one-way pair of Bush and Pine Streets. At Clay Street, the freeway would descend to meet the rising terrain, ending at Broadway just east of Van Ness Avenue as a single level depressed roadway. A short tunnel would curve northwest to a portal in Van Ness Avenue north of Broadway, taking traffic onto Van Ness Avenue towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Along with the Embarcadero and Broadway Tunnel, which were listed for rebuilding as ground-level expressways rather than the freeway (Embarcadero Freeway) that was later partially built and demolished, the Central Freeway would have provided a full traffic distributor loop around downtown.|$|E

2500|$|The {{city was}} subject to a {{widespread}} regeneration effort following the Birmingham Blitz during World War II. This public demand for modern buildings, combined with Victorian architectural styles falling out of favour, resulted in dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library being destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s by the city planners. These planning decisions were to {{have a profound effect}} on the image of Birmingham in subsequent decades, with the mix of concrete ring roads, shopping centres and tower blocks giving Birmingham a 'concrete jungle' tag. Sir Herbert Manzoni was made city engineer of Birmingham and his work included the construction of the Inner Ring Road, Middle Ring Road and the Outer Ring Road, which necessitated the purchase and clearance of vast areas of land. As well as this, he designated large areas of land redevelopment areas and set about clearing large areas of slums. The <b>elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> and the ring roads gave Birmingham the tag; [...] "Britain's motor city".

40|$|The title “Elevated Highways – A Solution to Brisbane’s Traffic Congestion?” {{initially}} {{outlines the}} probable {{contents of the}} upcoming dissertation. Many cities {{around the world are}} experiencing worsening traffic chaos especially in peak hour travelling times. The construction of road tunnels, elevated highways, freeways and interchanges, bus ways, transit lanes, tollways and automated traffic systems are some of the methods that planners, engineers and governments have utilized to try to increase the capacity of the road infrastructure network to alleviate the congestion in peak hour traffic. Thus, the much debated topic of what infrastructure or road systems to construct in order to overcome the dreaded “peak hour rush” for any city reaching the capacity of their current road and transport network, is a never ending question and topic for today’s transport engineers, planners, governments, environmentalists and public to agree upon. I believe the answer lies within the creativity of the design engineers to conjure up new designs of infrastructure, with new materials, creativity and form that are environmentally acceptable and at a viable cost. Today’s transport planners and governments need to also implement acceptable systems of control to allow the traffic to flow as well as increase the capacity and use of public transportation systems. My aim for the upcoming thesis was to highlight another type of road infrastructure solution that is affordable and could be designed to alleviate the traffic congestion that is now evident on our roads in Brisbane, primarily in the peak travel times. Thus, my infrastructure solution of elevated roadways/highways strategically placed throughout Brisbane within existing railway corridors or over existing freeways/motorways to increase the existing capacity had primarily been my predominant solution for the ease of the traffic congestion in Brisbane. <b>Elevated</b> <b>roadways</b> / motorways could be established within existing railway corridors and over existing freeways to minimise the traffic congestion on South East Queensland’s infrastructure as the population grows. ...|$|R
