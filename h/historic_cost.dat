50|$|A {{revaluation}} reserve is a reserve created {{when a company}} has an asset revalued {{and an increase in}} value is brought to account. A simple example is the situation where a bank owns the land and building of its head-offices and bought the properties for $100 a century ago. A current revaluation is likely to reflect a large increase in value. The increase would be added to a {{revaluation reserve}}. The reserve may arise out of a formal revaluation carried through to the bank's balance sheet, or a notional addition due to holding securities in the balance sheet valued at <b>historic</b> <b>cost.</b> Basel II also requires that the difference between the <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> and the actual value be discounted by 55% when using these reserves to calculate Tier 2 capital.|$|E

40|$|The {{addiction}} literature treats as {{a stylized}} fact that formal treatment programs have little long-run efficacy. Treated addicts have no better prospects for long-run abstinence than do addicts {{who do not}} enter treatment programs. A logical consequence {{of this is that}} if treatment enhances the prospects of long-run abstinence for some treated addicts, then it diminishes the prospects for others. This paper offers a simple cost-benefit argument explaining how treatment can interfere with certain natural processes conducive to permanently abandoning an addiction. The paper argues that a stable remission from addiction depends on the <b>historic</b> <b>costs</b> of the addiction relative to the historic benefits as perceived by the user. Because treatment intrinsically mitigates the cost of addiction but does not directly influence the benefits of addiction, treatment can make returning to an addiction more likely.

Hence, incumbent local exchange carriers have been fighting its implementation. In all probability, the U. S. Supreme Court will become involved in the debate over its adoption. The Supreme Court has looked at changes in valuation methods in the past. In the abandonment of the fair value doctrine, the Court established criteria to allow a paradigm shift. This Article argues that the same conditions may now exist for TELRIC pricing. Furthermore, the Article presents data that indicates that, to date, no taking has resulted from the use of TELRIC pricing. Hence, the Court is likely to find TELRIC as a viable alternative to historic rate of return pricing...|$|R
5000|$|Financial {{statements}} {{prepared in}} accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) show many assets based on their <b>historic</b> <b>costs</b> rather than at their current market values. For instance, a firm's balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value. But under GAAP requirements, a firm must show the fair values (which usually approximates market value) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost. When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value, some call this process [...] "mark-to-market". But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices. Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses. Despite the risk of manager bias, equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm's assets—rather than their historical costs—because current values give them better information to make decisions.|$|R

5000|$|Consumption {{of fixed}} capital (CFC) {{is a term}} used in {{business}} accounts, tax assessments and national accounts for depreciation of fixed assets. CFC is used in preference to [...] "depreciation" [...] to emphasize that fixed capital is used up {{in the process of}} generating new output, and because unlike depreciation it is not valued at <b>historic</b> <b>cost</b> but at current market value (so-called [...] "economic depreciation"); CFC may also include other expenses incurred in using or installing fixed assets beyond actual depreciation charges.

50|$|If {{the aim is}} {{to realise}} maximum {{shareholder}} value, two important valuation problems occur. Firstly, productive assets being used in production have no actual market price, being withdrawn from the market and not offered for sale.

The current value of productive assets can therefore be estimated only according to a probable price that they would have, if they were sold, or if they were replaced.

40|$|New {{powertrain}} technologies, such as Hybrid Electric Vehicles, have a {{price premium}} which {{can often be}} offset by lower running costs. Total Cost of Ownership combines these purchase and operating expenses to identify the most economical choice of vehicle. This is a valuable assessment for private and fleet purchasers alike. Studies to date have not compared Total Cost of Ownership across more than two vehicle markets or analysed <b>historic</b> <b>costs.</b> To address this gap, this research provides a more extensive Total Cost of Ownership assessment of conventional, Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles in three industrialized countries – the UK, USA (using California and Texas as case studies) and Japan – for the time period 1997 – 2015. Finally, the link between Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership and market share is analysed with a panel regression model. In all regions the incremental Total Cost of Ownership of hybrid and electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles has reduced from the year of introduction and 2015. Year on year Hybrid Electric Vehicles Total Cost of Ownership was found to vary least in the UK due {{to the absence of}} subsidies. Market share was found to be strongly linked to Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership through a panel regression analysis. Financial subsidies have enabled Battery Electric Vehicles to reach cost parity in the UK, California and Texas, {{but this is not the}} case for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles which haven’t received as much financial backing.

As a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s common stock prices are considered to be a rational measure of the present value of investors 2 ̆ 7 expected stream of future cash flows from investing in the stock, then common stock returns can be viewed as a proxy for the change in a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s perceived value. To the extent that the annual report effectively reports the economic events which account for changes in a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s common stock prices, the disclosed data should exhibit an association with common stock returns.;Multiple correlation/regression analysis was used to evaluate the extent that each of the three alternative reserves disclosures account for common stock returns after first recognizing the information provided by an industry variable and by an earnings per share or cash flow per share variable. The annual reports of 67 Canadian oil and gas exploration and development corporations were used to gather the data for each of the years 1982, 1983 and 1984.;The results indicated that the earnings per share provides significant information content while the cash flow per share consistently provides no significant evidence of information content. The capitalized costs reserves disclosure did not provide consistent evidence of information content, while the quantities disclosure and the discounted cash flows disclosure do provide significant incremental information content.;The study concludes that the alternative reserves disclosures of quantities and discounted cash flows are more informative to users when accounting for changes in a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s common stock prices than the disclosure of reserves in <b>historic</b> capitalized <b>costs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the various factors affecting the economic and technical feasibility of Engineered Geothermal Systems, with a special emphasis on advanced drilling technologies. The first part of the thesis was devoted to modeling and analysis of the technologies used to develop EGS projects. Since the cost of completing wells is a major factor in determining the economic feasibility of EGS projects, it is vital to be able to accurately predict in determining the economic feasibility of EGS projects, it is vital to be able to accurately predict their <b>costs.</b> <b>Historic</b> well <b>cost</b> data was analyzed to identify trends, and a drilling cost index for updating <b>historic</b> geothermal well <b>costs</b> to present day costs was developed. The effects of different advanced drilling technologies on drilling costs were estimated and incorporated into a techno-economic model to estimate their impact, as well as the impact of advanced reservoir stimulation technologies, on EGS levelized electricity costs. A technical analysis of geothermal binary Rankine cycle surface power plants was also performed to determine the effect of novel working fluids on plant efficiency for both sub- and supercritical binary cycles. The objective of {{the second part of the}} thesis was the application of thermal spallation drilling to deep boreholes. Thermal spallation is the fragmentation of a brittle solid into small, disc-like flakes by rapidly heating a confined fraction of the rock. It was proposed that the necessary temperatures and heat fluxes needed to induce thermal spallation in the high pressure, high density deep borehole environment could be achieved using hydrothermal flame technologies. An autoclave reaction system was designed and constructed to create flame jets in water at a pressure of 250 bar. The temperatures of these flames were measured, and attempts were made to use the flames to spall small rock samples. The experimental system was modified to study the centerline temperature decay of supercritical water jets injected at temperatures up to 525 °C into ambient temperature water. A device for measuring the heat flux from these jets was designed, constructed, and used to determine the heat transfer coefficients of the jets impinging against a flat surface. Together, these studies indicate that the necessary temperatures and heat fluxes required to induce thermal spallation in rocks can be achieved in a deep borehole. by Chad R. Augustine. Thesis (Ph.
