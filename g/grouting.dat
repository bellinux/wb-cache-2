While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design {{was based on the}} form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish.

5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected {{the candle}} each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project for}} free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with <b>grouting.</b> A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E

Incomplete <b>grouting</b> can lead to salt-water intrusion that will accelerate corrosion of these critical rods.

50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the <b>grout</b> shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical <b>grout</b> shoe. As the pile is driven the conical <b>grout</b> shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand <b>grout</b> that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer driving tool is fitted with a special <b>grout</b> box adapter to allow the <b>grout</b> to flow from the <b>grout</b> pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the <b>grout</b> should slightly exceed the take rate of the <b>grout.</b> In softer soils the <b>grout</b> takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the <b>grout</b> column.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{hydraulic}} cement <b>grouts</b> are approved for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the <b>grouts</b> should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate {{hydraulic cement}} <b>grouts.</b> Fourteen <b>grouts</b> were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested <b>grouts</b> all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most <b>grouts</b> tested shrank, even though tested <b>grouts</b> were labeled non-shrink <b>grouts.</b> For many applications of <b>grouts</b> such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those <b>grouts</b> which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used. Based on test results, criteria for evaluation of hydraulic cement <b>grouts</b> have been recommended. Evaluation consists of tests for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency, shrinkage and pullout test...|$|R

25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two intermediate shafts. Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and <b>grouting</b> ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E

[...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure.

Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks.

40|$|Bentonite {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{additives}} to cement to form <b>grouts</b> for completion of monitor wells. Recent studies have indicated that these <b>grouts</b> may not be the most appropriate method for completing monitor wells, because of fractures that form during curing of the <b>grouts.</b> Within <b>grouts</b> examined with optical microscopy, a reaction halo is present around the fracture. Further microprobe examinations indicate a zonation of elements around the fractures. Studies on cement-bentonite <b>grouts</b> that are used for slurry walls have indicated that montmorillonite dissolution and the formation of secondary minerals can lead to fracturing of the cement-bentonite <b>grouts.</b> This study will examine cement-bentonite <b>grouts,</b> which were used in the optical microscopy and microprobe study, to determine if secondary minerals can be identified. The study used powdered x-ray diffraction to examine the minerals present within four differently prepared cement-bentonite <b>grouts</b> and one neat cement <b>grout.</b> Three minerals were identified with x-ray diffraction in all mixtures of cement-bentonite <b>grouts</b> and the neat cement-grout. Those minerals were calcite, vaterite, and portlandite. The three minerals had variable intensities within each <b>grout.</b> There was one unidentified peak within the <b>grouts</b> that contained Aquagel?. Based on the results of the x-ray diffraction combined with the results of previous work, the unidentified peak was determined to be calcium silicate hydrate, which is a common secondary mineral formed from the dissolution of montmorillonite. It was concluded that the variation in intensity of the identified minerals was likely the result of excessive or inadequate hydration depending on the mixing method. It was also concluded that the fracturing within these <b>grouts</b> is the result of the dissolution of montmorillonite and formation of the secondary minerals. Based upon these results, it is clear that the common practice of completing monitor wells with cement-bentonite <b>grouts</b> in most geologic conditions is inappropriate. It is recommended that cement-bentonite <b>grouts</b> should only be used to complete monitor wells that are in fractured hard rocks, because the fracturing of the <b>grout</b> will be similar to that of the local rock...|$|R
