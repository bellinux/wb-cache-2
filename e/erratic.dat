5|$|Due to the <b>erratic</b> {{movement}} of the storm along the Texas coastline, significant rainfall fell in areas near the center and in parts of Louisiana. This led to widespread flooding, especially of farmland, that left $6million in damages. Five people were killed during the storm.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{establishment}} of ice age theories, many stories and legends were woven around the giant [...] "erratic blocks" [...] of rock. On Rügen, {{there are a lot}} of interesting large <b>erratics</b> due to the particular location of the island during the ice ages and due to continuous coastal erosion. In the New Stone Age people built megalithic tombs out of <b>erratics.</b> On Rügen many of these have survived. Until the 19th century large <b>erratics</b> were used as quarries, in order to produce construction material for monuments (e. g. in 1854 the Prussia Columns near Neukamp and Groß Stresow or for the Ernst Moritz Arndt Tower on the Rugard, for coastal and harbour defences, cobblestones and millstones. Many <b>erratics</b> fell victim to the development of Rügen. Today <b>erratics</b> are seen as natural monuments that are worth keeping and have a greater significance.|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} of thirty <b>erratics</b> from the Maastrichtian and Danian marine limestones in Denmark falls into four categories: quartzes, rocks from a composite crystalline complex, volcanic rocks and lithified sedimentary rocks. The author {{suggests that the}} <b>erratics</b> were mainly derived from the Fenno-Scandian Border Zone in Scania. The <b>erratics</b> show an increase in size from the Maastrichtian to the Danian {{which is likely to}} be related to the progressive approach of the coastline with regression...|$|R
50|$|The Scablands are {{littered}} with large boulders called glacial <b>erratics</b> that rafted on glaciers and were deposited by the glacial outburst flooding.

40|$|Twenty-two <b>erratics</b> {{collected}} from coastal moraines along {{the shores of}} Mount Discovery, Brown Peninsula, Minna Bluff, on Black Island, and from the Salmon and Miers valley floors in East Antarctica were examined for their mineral composition in the 3 ̆c 2 m fraction by x-ray diffraction to determine their provenance and the climate under which the sediment in the <b>erratics</b> formed. Semi-quantitative results from peak areas were subjected to principal components analysis and indicate {{that there are two}} distinct mineral compositions in the <b>erratics</b> (C = 0. 05) : A) dominant smectite group minerals, minor illite and kaolinite, and no chlorite, and B) dominant illite, subordinate smectite group, and either chlorite and R=l US clay or R= 3 US clay. Group A <b>erratics</b> include two types: 1) Eocene age siliciclastic sediment and 2) volcaniclastics of unknown age. Group B <b>erratics</b> comprise three types: 1) Eocene age siliciclastic sediment dominated by illite with subordinate smectite, no chlorite, and very low levels of kaolinite and mixed-layer clays; 2) post Eocene age <b>erratics</b> dominated by illite with a major component of chlorite and R=l US clay, minor or no smectite and kaolinite; and 3) post Eocene age <b>erratics</b> dominated by illite and containing R= 3 US clay. Eocene age sediment occurs in either group and so had two distinct provenances for the clay fraction: a smectite-dominant area and an illite-rich, smectite-poor area. Post Eocene age sediment also had two distinct provenances for the clay fraction and are different from the Eocene sources: a metamorphic + ancient sedimentary terrain that supplied chlorite, illite, and R=l US clay to some of the <b>erratics,</b> and a sedimentary terrain that supplied illite and R= 3 US clay. Kaolinite levels are low, indicating the absence of intense weathering and/or any significant contribution from the Beacon Supergroup...|$|R
50|$|The park's bedrock ledges {{consist of}} a type of gneiss called Monson Gneiss, a medium- to {{coarse-grained}} rock, light in color, mainly composed of plagioclase, quartz and biotite; trace amounts of garnet, epidote, magnetite {{can be observed in}} places. The park sits in a glacial valley, with steep declines on either side and an abundance glacial <b>erratics.</b> The <b>erratics</b> are smooth with sharp edges removed; the majority are composed of Monson Gneiss. Examples of other rock types {{can be found in the}} park, since <b>erratics</b> can sometimes be moved great distances.|$|R
50|$|The {{narrow strip}} of prairie covered by the Foothills <b>Erratics</b> Train extends along the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and {{northern}} Montana to the International Border. The boulders of the Foothills <b>Erratics</b> Train consist of pink and purple Lower Cambrian shallow marine quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite, that are not native to this region of Alberta. These rocks only occur within the Gog Group that is exposed in the Tonquin Valley in the Rocky Mountains of central western Alberta. Their specific source {{has been identified as}} being near Mount Edith Cavell in Jasper National Park. Lying on prairie to the east of the Rocky Mountains, the larger glacial <b>erratics</b> of the Foothills <b>Erratics</b> Train are visible for a considerable distance across the prairie and likely served as a prominent landmark for Indigenous people.|$|R

5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be <b>erratic</b> and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic <b>erratic</b> movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and <b>erratic</b> physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E

40|$|Mapping and {{regional}} geological studies in northern Greenland {{were carried out}} during the project Kane Basin 1999 (see Dawes et al. 2000, this volume). During ore geological studies in Washington Land by one of us (B. T.), finds of <b>erratics</b> of banded iron formation (BIF) directed {{special attention to the}} till, glaciofluvial and fluvial sediments. This led to the discovery that in certain parts of Daugaard-Jensen Land and Washington Land volcanic rocks form a common component of the surficial deposits, with particularly colourful, red por-phyries catching the eye. The presence of BIF is inter-esting but not altogether unexpected since BIF <b>erratics</b> have been reported from southern Hall Land just to the north-east (Kelly & Bennike 1992) and such rocks crop out in the Precambrian shield of North-West Greenland to the south (Fig. 1; Dawes 1991). On the other hand, the presence of volcanic <b>erratics</b> was unexpected and stimulated the work reported on here. This report deals with the finds and distribution of the volcanic <b>erratics</b> and on their provenance; petro-logical and chemical work, including isotopic age deter-mination, is in progress. 35 A new volcanic province: evidence from glacial <b>erratics</b> in western North Greenlan...|$|R
