50|$|Such trusts must be {{irrevocable}} (a revocable {{trust will}} not provide asset protection because {{and to the}} extent of the settlor's power to revoke). Most of them contain a spendthrift clause preventing a trust beneficiary from alienating his or her expected interest in favor of a creditor. The spendthrift clause has three <b>general</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the protection afforded: the self-settled trusts (if the settlor of a trust is also a beneficiary of a trust), the case when a debtor is the sole beneficiary and the sole trustee of a trust, and the support payments (a court may order the trustee to satisfy a beneficiary's support obligation to a former spouse or minor child). The first general exception, which accounts for the majority of asset protection trusts, no longer applies in several jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions including Alaska, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands allow self-settled trusts to afford their settlors the protection of the spendthrift clause.|$|E

One salut d'amor, by a woman (Azalais d'Altier) to a woman (Clara d'Anduza) is also extant and one anonymous planh is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the trobar leu style; only two poems, one by Lombarda and another Alais, Yselda, and Carenza, are usually considered {{to belong to the}} more demanding trobar clus. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and Castelloza, with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, Gaudairença, wrote a song entitled Coblas e dansas, which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.|$|E
50|$|In theory, it is {{possible}} to use existing measures within the WTO to protect certain human rights. Within the WTO Agreements there are <b>general</b> <b>exceptions</b> (GATT Article XX) {{that can be used for}} the protection of specific human rights. GATT Article XX paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) can be used to impose unilateral trade restrictive measures on countries for unacceptable labour standards. However, the wording of the exceptions has resulted in extreme difficulty for those who try to invoke trade measures, as is evidenced by 48 years of GATT where no country restricted trade through these sections. One of the reasons for this is that even when trade restrictive measures are successfully applied to a state, GATT Article 1, the principle of most favoured nation treatment, comes into play. This prescribes in essence, that any country which treats a state in a particular way then has to grant the same treatment to all other states. In regards to sanctions this means that if trade sanctions are applied to one country for a certain human rights abuse, they must then be applied to all countries who abuse the same right. This can have massive economic and political ramifications.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent International Investment Agreements have {{incorporated}} <b>General</b> <b>Exceptions</b> similar to GATT Article XX {{in order to}} balance the respect of National Treatment and protection of States’ right to regulate. The {{purpose of this article}} is to determine if these exceptions are a suitable choice in order to achieve this objective or if another option would be preferable. We first established that <b>General</b> <b>Exceptions</b> are operative exceptions and not interpretative statements. This allowed to assess their effect on the in-terpretation of national treatment and we managed to prove their poten-tially detrimental effect on the right to regulate. Then, we searched for other means to interpret National Treatment compatible with <b>general</b> <b>exceptions</b> but none appears to be really effective in achieving the purpose to balance protection of investments and State’s right to regulate. As a consequence, a final study for other treaty wording achieving the stated objective allows to conclude that the most suitable choice would be to codify selected arbitral award allowing to take into account public policy objectives to determine if two investors are in same circumstances, therefore securing the contempla-ted balanc...|$|E

40|$|Most recent {{case-law}} {{and scholarly}} work {{suggests that the}} exception clauses in GATT Art. XX and GATS Art. XIV provide a meaningful regulatory instrument in balancing domestic trade policies. Arguably, results from the two-tier analysis {{could serve as a}} basis for a legal benchmark for the scope of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) flexibilities. SDT could theoretically altogether be replaced with the <b>general</b> <b>exceptions</b> if they were to provide sufficient and meaningful flexibility for developing countries and Least-Developed Countries (LDCs). This paper assesses the suitability of the two-tier analysis for providing a meaningful legal benchmark for the scope of SDT flexibilities in a case-study on GATS Art. V flexibility, and discusses the implications of replacing SDT flexibility by the general exception clauses. It shows that the two-tier analysis indeed provides for an interesting legal instrument for introducing transparency and graduation in SDT flexibilities, but that the <b>general</b> <b>exceptions</b> do not appear suitable for replacing SDT flexibilities as long as their lists of legitimate policy objectives remains unchanged...|$|E
