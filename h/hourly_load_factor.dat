It compares stochastic analysis to traditional peak hour factor (PHF) analysis to gain further insight into variability of transit route segments’ passenger loading during a study hour. It demonstrates that <b>hourly</b> design <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is a useful method of modeling a route segment’s capacity and QoS time history across the study weekday. This analysis method is readily adaptable to different passenger load standards by adjusting design percentile, reflecting either a more relaxed or more stringent condition. This paper also considers hourly coefficient of variation of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as a capacity and QoS assessment measure, in particular through its relationships with hourly average and design <b>load</b> <b>factors.</b> Smaller value reflects uniform passenger loading, which is generally indicative of well dispersed passenger boarding demands and good schedule maintenance. Conversely, higher value may be indicative of pulsed or uneven passenger boarding demands, poor schedule maintenance, and/or bus bunching. An assessment table based on hourly coefficient of variation of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is developed and applied to this case study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{minimize}} off-grid Diesel generation costs by best choosing the number, size and dispatch schedule of the generators comprising the power plant. The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem takes into account: sizedependent full-and part-load fuel consumption; size dependent investment costs; size- and dispatch-dependent operational and maintenance costs. It is assumed that daily hourly demand is known. The objective function is the annual sum of the fuel, investment and operational and maintenance costs on an hourly basis. The decision variables are the <b>hourly</b> generator's <b>load</b> <b>factors.</b> In the optimization routine, the number of generators is prescribed. Generators are chosen within a prescribed power range from a data bank of industrial diesel gensets. All possible combinations of the generators are optimized. Possible combinations {{are the ones that}} meet the hourly demand and may include duplicated generators. The developed program lists the best five combinations. To solve the optimization problem we have used the available NCONF/IMSL subroutine, which is based on the successive quadratic programming method to solve general nonlinear optimization problems. The optimization problem was applied to three north-region Brazilian communities. For these sites, we have concluded that substantial reductions on generation costs can be accomplished through generators resizing and through appropriate maintenance...|$|R

We propose a new methodology that uses <b>hourly</b> daily <b>loads</b> to predict the next year <b>hourly</b> <b>loads,</b> and hence predict the peak loads expected to be reached in the next coming year. The technique is based on implementing multivariable regression on previous year’s <b>hourly</b> <b>loads.</b> Three regression models are investigated in this research: the linear, the polynomial, and the exponential power. The proposed models are applied to real loads of the Jordanian power system.

Thus, the {{multiple linear regression}} model (also Vanilla Model in [11]) is utilized as an outliers detector in the second stage.

The absolute percentage error (APE) is calculated after fitting the historical <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> for each <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> in training set.

30|$|Before {{forecasting}} an <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> of {{the next}} hour using DRM, each anomaly detection method is tried individually {{to determine whether the}} newly-acquired <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> data of the current hour should be used or replaced with the predicted <b>hourly</b> <b>load.</b> To measure the performance of the four anomaly detection methods, we used two measures introduced in [26]. One is false negative rate (FNR), which indicates the ratio of the number of undetected anomalies to the number of all anomalies. The other is false positive rate (FNR), which indicates the ratio of the number of normal points being detected as anomalies to the number of normal points. A smaller FNR or FPR value indicates that the corresponding method is more effective for anomaly detection. Since the ultimate goal of anomaly detection is to enhance the VSTLF accuracy, we also use the MAPE value to evaluate the one-hour-ahead forecasting accuracy after each anomaly detection method is applied.|$|R

40|$|Although {{electricity}} demand receives much {{attention in the}} empirical literature (see Taylor (1975) and EPRI (1982 b) for excellent surveys on the topic), <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> demand analysis has only recently begun. Notable contributions {{are a series of}} studies sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI (1977. 1979 a, 1979 b, 1981 a, 19816. 1982 a) and Platt (1983)). These studies estimate load curve models for regions of the United States. Unfortunately, from a utility perspective, the empirical results presented in these studies are not directly applicable. Further, because the data used in these studies are not generally available at the geographic level of a utility service area, applying their methodology is problematic. This paper presents a practical method for an electric utility to produce an <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> curve model similar in overall framework to these studies. Our procedure is innovative in that it produces statistically efficient estimates, which the above papers do not. We also demonstrate a method that uses supplementary forecasts to enhance the forecasting performance of the <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> model. ...|$|R
40|$|Short-term load {{forecasting}} {{is important}} for power system generation planning and operation. For unit commitment and dispatch processes to incorporate uncertainty, a short-term load model must not only provide accurate load predictions but also enable the generation of reasonable probabilistic scenarios or uncertainty sets. This paper proposes a temporal and weather conditional epi-splines based load model (TWE) using functional approximation. TWE models the dependence of load on time and weather separately by functional approximation using epi-splines, conditional on season and area, in each segment of similar weather days. Load data are transformed from various day types to a specified reference day type among similar weather days in the same season and area, in order to enrich the data for capturing the non-weather dependent load pattern. In an instance derived from an Independent System Operator in the U. S., TWE not only provides accurate <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> prediction and narrow bands of prediction errors, but also yields serial correlations among forecast <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> values within a day {{that are similar to}} those of actual <b>hourly</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
40|$|Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Method {{is applied}} to fore cast the {{short-term}} load for a large power system. The load has two distinct patterns: weekday and weekend-day patterns. The weekend-day pattern includes Saturdays, Sunday and Monday loads. A nonlinear load model is proposed and several structures of ANN for short term forecasting are tested. Inputs to the ANN are past loads and {{the output of the}} ANN is the load forecast for a given day. The network with one or two hidden layers is tested with various combinations of neurons, and the results are compared in terms of forecasting error. The neural network, when grouped into different load patterns, gives good load forecast. This project presents a study of short-term <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> forecasting using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, publicly available data from the Australian national electricity market (NEMMCO) web site has been taken to forecast the <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> for the Victorian power system. We predicted the <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> demand for a full week {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Historical load data of 2006 obtained from the NEMMCO web site was divided into several where half of them are used for training and the other half is used for testing the ANN. The inputs used were the <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> demand for the full day (24 hours) for the state and the daily temperature, humidity and wind speeds of two major cities. The outputs obtained were the predicted <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> demand for the next day. The neural network used has 3 layers: an input, a hidden, and an output layer. The number of inputs was 37 while the number of hidden layer neurons was varied for different performance of the network. The output layer has 24 neurons. We trained the network over 6 weeks.

This paper discusses the neural network specification in terms of conventional econometric language, providing parallel concepts for terms such as training, learning, and nodes in the, hidden layer. It is shown that these models are flexible nonlinear equations that can be estimated using nonlinear least squares. It is argued that these models are especially well suited to <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> forecasting, reflecting the presence of important nonlinearities and variable interactions. The paper proceeds to show how conventional statistics, such as the BIC and MAPE statistics can be used to select the number of nodes in the hidden layer. It is concluded that these models provide a powerful, robust and sensible approach to <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> forecasting that will provide modest improvements in forecast accuracy relative to well-specified regression models. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods.

The <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> centers, for each of the different <b>hourly</b> <b>load</b> scenarios, are calculated deterministically.
