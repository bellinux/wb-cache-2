5|$|Public {{transport}} services in Greater Manchester are co-ordinated by Transport <b>for</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester (TfGM), a public body with powers between {{those of a}} passenger transport executive and Transport for London, established as SELNEC PTE in 1969 {{in accordance with the}} Transport Act 1968. The original SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive was renamed as the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) when taken over by the Greater Manchester County Council on 1 April 1974 to co-ordinate public transport modes within the new county. The council had overall responsibility for strategic planning and all policy decisions covering public transport (such as bus and rail services) and highways. GMPTE's purpose was to secure the provision of a completely integrated and efficient system of passenger transport <b>for</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester on behalf of the county council. In 1977, it was noted as the largest authority for public transport in the United Kingdom after London Transport. GMPTE was renamed as Transport <b>for</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester in April 2011 when it became a functional body of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and obtained powers additional to those of a regular passenger transport executive from central government.|$|E

5|$|A {{light rail}} system <b>for</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

5|$|A stealth {{game is a}} type {{of video}} game that tasks the player with using stealth to avoid or {{overcome}} antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, using disguises or avoiding noise. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but mostly rewarding the player <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> levels of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, and assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and even platformers.|$|E

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005.
