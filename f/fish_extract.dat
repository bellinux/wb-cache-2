One way to circumvent {{this problem is}} to coat surfaces (in this report stainless steel) with a non-toxic <b>fish</b> <b>extract</b> that generates an abiotic surface with less bacterial attachment than uncoated surfaces or surfaces coated with, for example, tryptone soy broth. The bacteria grow well in the fish extract; hence a general bacteriocidal effect is not {{the reason for the}} antifouling effect. Bacterial attachment was quantified by different methods including (a) direct fluorescence microscopy, (b) removal by ultrasound and subsequent quantification of the adhered bacteria, and (c) regrowth of the adhered bacteria measured by indirect conductometry. Surprisingly, the bacterial counts on surfaces coated with aqueous <b>fish</b> <b>extract</b> were 10 - 100 times lower than on surfaces coated with laboratory broths when surfaces were submerged in bacterial suspensions. The effect was seen for Pseudomonas fluorescens AH 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1, Escherichia coli MG 1655, Vibrio anguillarum 90 - 11 - 287 and Aeromonas salmonicida Jno 3175 / 88.

40|$|Background Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) {{is one of}} {{nephrotic}} syndrome classification which {{do not respond to}} therapy with steroid. Children with SRNS have high risk of decline of kidney’s function. Glomerular filtration rate can be used as indicator of kidney’s function. Snakehead <b>fish</b> <b>extract</b> supplementation can increase serum albumin level, therefore is expected to increase glomerular filtration rate indirectly. Aim This study aims to prove the effect of Snakehead <b>fish</b> <b>extract</b> supplementation on glomerular filtration rate in children with SRNS aged 2 - 18 years old. Methods This was a quasi experimental study with pre and post design performed in the pediatric polyclinic of Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang. There were 10 patients which 3 of them drop out in the process. Patients recieved gabus-fish extract suplementation with 2 x 500 mg dose for 21 days. Data was statistically analyzed by paired t-test. Results The initial Glomerular filtration rate mean was 114, 09 ± 41, 60 ml/min/ 1, 73 m 2 decreased to 105, 97 ± 33, 81 ml/menit/ 1, 73 m 2 after the intervention, with differences mean of - 8, 12 ± 39, 23 ml/menit/ 1, 73 m 2. There was no significant difference (p= 0, 604) in glomerular filtration rates before and after intervention.

Many surface {{treatments}} (e. g. use of antimicrobial agents) may help reduce biofilm formation, {{but the potential}} exists for developing bacterial resistance, and loss of function by agents getting depleted or covered up by organic matter (e. g. proteins). New surfaces that provide a barrier to bacterial attachment, but are not inhibitory and toxic, are highly desirable. We have recently discovered that attachment of bacteria found in the food industry is reduced by several orders of magnitude by coatings of an extract made from fish, compared to other organic layers (e. g. from meat, broth, milk). The coating does not per se inhibit microbial growth, the effect lasts up to 48 hours and the treatment is non-toxic. The coatings are equally effective against a range of bacteria persistent on food processing equipment including Ps. fluorescens strain AH 2, E. coli strain MG 1655, Vibrio anguillarum strain 90 - 11 - 287, and Aeromonas salmonicida strain Jno 3175 / 88. The extracts can be coated on metals (stainless steel) or polymers (polystyrene) and still be effective.

Application of Florisil SPE using acetone-methanol (7 : 3, v:v) condition facilitated the separation of 4. 2 „b 0. 4 mg (mean„bS. E. M.) of purified target fraction from 20 mg ether extract with good retention of CTXs. Mouse bioassay analysis demonstrated that the average CTX recovery of target fraction from CTX-spiked samples was 75. 8 „b 3. 3 %, which was significantly increased by 96. 7 „b 15 % when compared with CTX recovery from ether extracts (44. 8 „b 5. 2 %) without performing SPE purification. Over 70 % of non-target lipids were removed, in which no CTX toxicity was found. Moreover, the target fractions of both CTX-spiked and naturally CTX-contaminated samples elicited more prominent toxic responses of hypothermia and/or induced more rapid death of the mice. The use of acetone-methanol (7 : 3, v:v) condition in the elution could significantly improve overall recovery of CTXs, while minimizing the possible interferences of lipidic matrix from co-extractants on mice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The catfish viscera fat, is cathfish {{processing}} by-products, {{has potential}} {{to be used as}} a source of raw material for production of fish oil. This study aimed to analyze the value of proximate, heavy metal content and fatty acid profile of catfish viscera fat (Pangasius hypopthalmus) and characterized <b>fish</b> oil <b>extracted</b> by dry rendering in various temperature and time than compared it to <b>fish</b> oil <b>extracted</b> by stove heating to obtain the best treatment. Proximate, heavy metal residue, and the fatty acid profile analysis were conducted for characterizing catfish viscera fat. Fish oil extraction was conducted by dry rendering in various temperatures of 50, 60, 70, 80 °C for 1, 2, and 3 hours. Fish oil quality was determined by the chemical characteristics i. e. PV, FFA, anisidin and TOTOX. The results of the study showed that fat content of catfish fat viscera was 88. 19 %, the heavy metals content was below SNI standart to be consumed, and fatty acid profile composition was SFA>MUFA>PUFA. The highest fatty acid content was oleic acid. The best fish oil quality was resulted on temperature extraction of 50 °C for 2 hours with yield value, PV, FFA, anisidin, and TOTOX were 45. 17 %, 2. 77 meq/kg, 0. 83 %, 2. 86 meq/kg, 8. 39 meq/kg respectively. This result was not significantly different with <b>fish</b> oil <b>extracted</b> by the stove heating expect for yield and PV were 80. 11 % and 6. 52 meq/kg, respectively. <br /...|$|R
