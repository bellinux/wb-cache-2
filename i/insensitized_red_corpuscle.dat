40|$|In {{hanging drop}} {{preparations}} of normal blood from various species of animals including man, the following processes were directly observed {{for the first}} time: 1. The process of fusion between two <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> so as to form a round or slightly oval macrocyte with normal hemoglobin content, a diameter of 10 µ± and no delle. These macrocytes appear to be slightly thicker in the centre than at the periphery. No thickness measurements could be made. 2. The process of fusion between two microcytes each 5 µ± in diameter, so as to form a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of approximately normal size but with dense hemoglobin and no delle. 3. The process of fusion between a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> and a microcyte, forming a macrocyte slightly larger than a normal <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> and exhibiting a normal hemoglobin tint but no delle. 4. The process of microcyte formation from <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> was seen occurring in four different ways: (a) By the intermittent compression of a single <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> by the pull of three or more fibrin threads attached to the corpuscle. (b) By the steady, continuous compression of a single <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> by the pull of two polar fibrin threads, (c) By intermittent rises of intracorpuscular pressure in a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> due to trauma, (d) By avulsion and retraction or contraction of the hemoglobin stroma from the intact surface layer of a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle.</b> Thickness measurements in single microcytes were made in rabbit blood. 5. The process of a typical microcyte with dense hemoglobin and no delle changing back to a fairly large <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> with practically normal hemoglobin tint and with a delle. 6. Macrocytes were seen expelling their hemoglobin in {{a fraction of a}} second and turning into shadows which were often paler than the background, but without any decrease in the visible surface area or change in the contour. 7. Extensibility and retractibility (or perhaps relaxation and contraction) may be exhibited by the corpuscle as a whole, by local sections of both surface layer and stroma, or retractility (contractility (?)) may be shown by the hemoglobin stroma alone. On the basis of observational evidence it is inferred that: 1. The surface layer of a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> is probably a condensed stroma rather than an anatomically defined membrane. 2. A pigment, probably hemoglobin, is present in the surface layer. 3. The surface layer of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> becomes rigid before or during spontaneous hemolysis. 4. Hemoglobin exists in an undissolved form in the intact <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle.</b> 5. The transverse diameter of microcytes (5 µ±) represents the maximal shortening of which this diameter is capable in normal <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> of man, rabbit and guinea pig under the conditions studied. 6.

In cats it is always negligible in amount and frequently absent. Phagocytosis will not suffice as a general explanation of normal blood destruction. When the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of the cat, dog, rabbit, or monkey are slowly perfused with defibrinated blood or Locke"s solution, bodies are given off into the fluid which have the appearance of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> that have lost their hemoglobin but retained {{the rest of their}} cell substance. These bodies possess many of the properties supposedly distinctive of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> They are the product of disordered parenchymal cells. By a special method, it has proved possible to search the body, organ by organ, and the circulating blood also, for disintegrating <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Shadows of <b>red</b> cells are not present anywhere, nor are hemolyzing red cells found. A hemolytic process, in the ordinary sense of the term, can scarcely play an. important part in normal blood destruction. Instead, it is certain that some <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> at least, are destroyed in another way; namely, by fragmentation. Normal blood regularly contains small numbers of fragmentation forms—microcytes and poikilocytes—and accumulations of them are regularly present in the spleen, but are found only inconstantly in the other organs. The fragments are in evident process of further subdivision. They occur not only in species in which phagocytosis as a means of cell destruction is negligible (cats), but also in animals in which it is an important process (dogs, some rabbits). The method of study that we have employed is well suited to disclose how the blood is destroyed. The importance of cell fragmentation in this connection is indicated by our failure to find any other means of destruction, save only the phagocytosis already known. Further facts indicating the importance of fragmentation are presented in our second paper, where a general discussion will also be found...|$|R

Hippocrates, too, endowed this fluid with special properties; however, he considered it little more important than other fluids in the body. In the first century B. C., Aristotle viewed the blood with some scientific interest; he {{used it as a}} basis for classifying animals into sanguineous and bloodless. Galen's humoral concept of physiology, with the blood as one of the controlling factors in the nature of man, was retained {{along with the rest of}} his medical philosophy; indeed, we are prone even today to speak of a person as of a "sanguine" temperament. The alchemists, in their fumbling search for the philosopher's stone, examined the blood, but their results had little lasting import. Though the blood as the stream of life had thus long been an object of interest and speculation, not until the late seventeenth century was it examined by discerning eyes and its structure seen to be not a homogeneous red liquid, but a clear fluid containing myriads of pale yellow discs. It was in 1658 that Swammerdam' 32, then just twenty-one years old, first observed and described the <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Unfortunately, a few years later he joined a religious cult which considered scientific inquiry vain and fruitless; therefore, much of his work was not published until after his death.

These hemoglobin mounds may be seen protruding through various portions of the crescentic bodies, {{as well as at the}} periphery of the parasites. The base of the mounds is occasionally outlined by the chromatin or pigment granules. The hemoglobin mounds protruding through the body proper of the crescentic bodies do not seem to alter the general outline of the parasites. The outline of the parasites may be traced through the transparent mounds. Whenever attaching pseudopodia are observed they are seen to arise from the cytoplasm of the parasites and may be in the form of loops or strings. When the crescents are attached they proceed to dissolve the hemoglobin to make it available for utilization, assimilating what is required for nutrition, the waste product being in the form of pigment granules.

40|$|In {{summarizing}} {{the results of}} this work I feel justified in drawing the following conclusions: 1. The fuchsin body represents a type of body subject to wide variations in morphology and in staining reaction. 2. Though more frequently associated with plasma cells than with any other cell type, these bodies may and do occur in a great variety of cells. 3. Further, certain sections show unmistakable fuchsin bodies within blood vessels; some of these bodies are true hyaline thrombi, while others are due to autolytic changes in the <b>red</b> blood <b>corpuscles.</b> 4. Fuchsin bodies are most numerous in granulation tissue and lymphoid areas. In the former, they follow closely the distribution of capillaries and show a parallel with the changes in the extra- and intravascular <b>red</b> blood <b>corpuscles.</b> 5. The number and type of fuchsin bodies in tissues can be influenced by methods of fixation, the number of typical bodies being inversely proportional to the rapidity and degree of fixation of the red blood cells. 6. The type of body found after the best fixation is not, as a rule, what is considered the typical form, but an irregular fragmentary type or the fuchsinophilic granular form. 7. The identity in staining reaction, the constant association with changes in <b>red</b> blood <b>corpuscles,</b> the relation to distribution of capillaries in granulation tissues, the occurrence in hemorrhagic lesions associated with pigment, the intravascular occurrence, and, finally, the close relation to pigment deposits, all indicate conclusively that fuchsin bodies arise from <b>red</b> blood <b>corpuscles.</b> 8. No theory of origin from plasma cells, or other granular cells, offers an adequate explanation for the origin of fuchsin bodies, nor can any theory prove adequate which {{does not take into account}} the <b>red</b> blood <b>corpuscles.</b> 9. The peculiar association of plasma cells with fuchsin bodies and hemosiderin seems explainable on the assumption that the plasma cell in such instances is the active factor in a metabolic process, the fuchsin body representing a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by an intracellular enzyme, and hemosiderin, one of the products of the process...|$|R

Granules were observed in the erythrocytes of calves, of young cats, of human fetuses, and even of normal adult animals. They were plentiful in the blood of man after hemorrhage and in the erythrocytes of human patients with certain chronic diseases, especially after iron therapy. The "granular " cells were larger than normal erythrocytes.
