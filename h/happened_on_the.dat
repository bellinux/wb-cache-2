5|$|Hordern came to {{prominence}} in the early 1950s when he {{took part in a}} theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. There, he impressed Glen Byam Shaw who secured the actor a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre where he played major parts, including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1958 he won a best actor award at that year's British Academy Television Awards for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing <b>Happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Way to the Forum (1966).|$|E

5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones.

5|$|In October 2012, {{a casting}} sheet for five lead roles was sent out. Later that month, at the New York Comic Con, Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige and Clark Gregg {{announced}} that Gregg, who previously portrayed the {{character in the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe films Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Marvel's The Avengers, {{as well as the}} Marvel One-Shots short films The Consultant and A Funny Thing <b>Happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Way to Thor's Hammer, would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson in the pilot.

5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan {{about the nature of}} their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people {{squashed}} in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred {{at a number of}} balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E
