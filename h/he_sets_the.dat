25|$|Lassus wrote four {{settings}} of the Passion, {{one for each}} of the Evangelists, St. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) <b>he</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> figure diagonally {{to the picture}} space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The {{back of her head}} and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E

25|$|Like Amos, Hosea {{elevated}} {{the religion of}} Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God's nature. Israel's faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled Him to punish the people because of His own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this <b>he</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> unquenchable love of God, who, {{in spite of this}} infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will take His people unto Himself again after the judgment.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} work on Bartle Frere's life, The Zulu and the Raj; The Life of Sir Bartle Frere by D. P. O'Connor, {{examines}} details of Frere's life and motives more fully than was permissible in Victorian times when Martineau was writing. In particular, O'Connor points to Frere {{as a leading}} thinker on imperial defence. <b>He</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> Zulu war {{in the context of}} the overall global crisis, contingent on the 1877 Balkan War, which was widely expected to result in war between Britain and Russia. Frere was sent to South Africa to turn this vital area into a secure bastion on the route to India, but was distracted from the task by the routine instability of the South African theatre.|$|E
500|$|The Drapier {{begins his}} letter with three quotations: Psalm 109, Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 7, and Virgil's Aeneid Book Five.

50|$|In 2001, <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> Bolivian Records in {{the long}} course 50 and 100 {{backstroke}} (27.85 and 59.90), and in 2003 <b>he</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> national marks {{in the long}} course 200 back (2:10.87), {{and at the same}} meet in Spain, all 3 short course backstroke marks (26.14, 56.79 and 2:02.26).|$|R

2500|$|Susan {{lives with}} her grandfather, the mysterious Doctor, who does not {{otherwise}} identify himself. [...] He is a cranky, hostile, suspicious old man {{who appears to be}} a fugitive.

2500|$|Astaire's {{execution}} of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew {{from a variety of}} influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his [...] "outlaw style," [...] an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As Jerome Robbins stated, [...] "Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way <b>he</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive." [...] Astaire further observed: ...|$|E
2500|$|His work often parodies {{popular song}} forms, though he usually creates {{original}} melodies when doing so. A notable exception is [...] "The Elements", where <b>he</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> {{names of the}} chemical elements {{to the tune of}} the Major-General's song from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. Lehrer's early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its black humor in songs such as [...] "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park". In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs dealing with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show That Was the Week That Was. Despite their topical subjects and references, the popularity of these songs has endured; Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: [...] "Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet." ...|$|E

Now Mr. Fearing was one that played upon this bass; he and his fellows sound the sackbut, whose notes are more doleful than the notes of other music are; though, indeed, some say the bass is the ground of music.

60|$|A serang is {{a person}} of importance, far above a stoker, though the stoker draws better pay. <b>He</b> <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> chorus of 'Hya! Hulla! Hee-ah!

Then the passengers give him money, and he saves it all up for an orgie at Bombay or Calcutta, or Pulu Penang. 'Ho! you fat black barrel, you're eating my food!' said Pambe, in the Other Lingua Franca that begins where the Levant tongue stops, and runs from Port Said eastward till east is west, and the sealing-brigs of the Kurile Islands gossip with the strayed Hakodate junks.|$|E
