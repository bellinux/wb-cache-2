5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, <b>drums,</b> <b>and</b> wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, <b>drums,</b> <b>and</b> shell or wood trumpets.|$|E

50|$|Born {{around the}} same time as jungle, breakcore and digital {{hardcore}} share many of the elements of <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass and to the uninitiated, tracks from the extreme end of <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass may sound identical to breakcore thanks to speed, complexity, impact and maximum sonic density combined with musical experimentation. German <b>Drum</b> <b>and</b> Bass DJ The Panacea {{is also one of the}} leading Digital Hardcore artists. Raggacore resembles a faster version of the ragga influenced jungle music of the 1990s, similar to breakcore but with more friendly dancehall beats (dancehall itself being a very important influence on <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass). Darkcore, a direct influence on <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass, was combined with influences of <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass itself leading to the creation of darkstep. There is considerable crossover from the extreme edges of <b>drum</b> <b>and</b> bass, breakcore, darkcore, digital hardcore and raggacore with fluid boundaries.|$|R
