50|$|The KSR {{processor}} was a 2-wide VLIW, {{with instructions}} of 6 types: memory reference (load and store), execute, control flow, memory control, I/O, and inserted. Execute instructions included arithmetic, logical, and type conversion. They were usually triadic register in <b>format.</b> <b>Control</b> flow refers to branches and jumps. Branch instructions were two cycles. The programmer (or compiler) could implicitly control the quashing {{behavior of the}} subsequent two instructions that would be initiated during the branch. The choices were: always retain the results, retain results if branch test is true, or retain results if branch test is false. Memory control provided synchronization primitives. I/O instructions were provided. Inserted instructions were forced into a flow by a coprocessor. Inserted load and store were used for direct memory access (DMA) transfers. Inserted memory instructions were used to maintain cache coherency. New coprocessors could be interfaced with the inserted instruction mechanism. IEEE standard floating point arithmetic was supported. Sixty-four 64-bit wide registers were included.|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{broadcasters}} {{are looking}} for practical approaches to digital audio production and delivery. One of the main dilemmas is to assess and control loudness with precision but without latency. Concerns include the added production time predicted with some suggestions of pre-transmission loudness measurements and <b>format</b> <b>control.</b> More TV channels with {{the same amount of}} viewers is not an indication to employ extra time in production. In this paper, new realtime approaches to securing loudness consistency, speech intelligibility, audio quality and <b>format</b> <b>control</b> are described. Experience from broadcast stations will be reported, including strategies for optimizing perceptually data-reduced audio, and targeting it for specific groups of listeners. ...|$|E

40|$|Mental {{contrasting}} with implementation intentions (MCII) {{has been}} found to improve self-regulation across many life domains. The present research investigates whether MCII can benefit time management. In Study 1, we asked students to apply MCII to a pressing academic problem and assessed how they scheduled their time for the upcoming week. MCII participants scheduled more time than control participants who in their thoughts either reflected on similar contents using different cognitive procedures (content-control group) or applied the same cognitive procedures on different contents (format-control group). In Study 2, students were taught MCII as a metacognitive strategy to be used on any upcoming concerns of the subsequent week. As compared with the week prior to the training, students in the MCII (vs. <b>format</b> <b>control)</b> condition improved in self-reported time management. In Study 3, MCII (vs. <b>format</b> <b>control)</b> helped working mothers who enrolled in a vocational business program to attend classes more regularly.

The Bidi_Character_Type marks a characters behaviour in directional writing. To override a direction, Unicode has defined special <b>formatting</b> <b>control</b> characters (Bidi-Controls).
