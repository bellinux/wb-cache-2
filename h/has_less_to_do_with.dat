500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Spiro Agnew than with the office I held".|$|E
500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{employment}}: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women. The burden of informal care work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with caring responsibilities, which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment. Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this [...] "child-effect" [...] has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike.|$|E

Since 2011 from the digital scene two films have stood out with box office success as highest grossing Pakistani films; Waar followed by Main Hoon Shahid Afridi. However, as some commentators cautioned, declaring a film a 'hit' or a 'flop' is determined by the relationship of the budget spent and box office returns of a film and therefore several of the top-grossing films of Pakistan were technically not a 'hit'. Nonetheless, the lack of box office returns of a Pakistani film <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the film itself but {{more to do with the}} severely limited number of screens in Pakistan. Another film, Zinda Bhaag (Run for your Life, 2013) has been critically acclaimed with reviewers calling it 'the best film to have come out of modern-day Pakistani cinema' and a [...] "new metaphor for Pakistani cinema" [...] that [...] "bode(d) well for the possibility of noteworthy Pakistani imports in years to come". Zinda Bhaag went on to be Pakistan's official submission to the Oscars (Foreign Film Category), the first after a gap of fifty years but did not make the final shortlist nominees.|$|E

At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does {{a better job than}} most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] clich√©. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E
2500|$|... 2013 {{proved to}} be a great year for Pakistani cinema. In March, Siyaah (meaning Pitch black) was the first horror thriller film to be {{released}} in Pakistan in over 20 years. Directed by Azfar Jafri and written by Osman Khalid Butt, the film starred Hareem Farooq, Qazi Jabbar, Mahnoor Usman and Ahmed Ali Akbar. The film was about a dissociative personality disorder patient who uses black magic against unsuspecting relatives. The film collected over ‚Ç®2.65 crore (US$260,000) at the box office. The following month Chambaili, an Urdu-language political thriller film directed by Ismail Jilani, was released starring Salmaan Peerzada, Khalid Ahmed, Mohammed Ehteshamuddin, Maira Khan, Shafqat Cheema and Ghulam Mohiuddin also made a special appearance. The film was a political drama exploring the subject of political corruption in Pakistan. Since the flower 'Chambaili' (lily flower) is the national flower of Pakistan, the film-makers' intentions were to encourage patriotism and nationalism in Pakistan. The film made [...] at the box office. Waar ( [...] ; , meaning [...] "The Strike") was the winner of 2013. The action-thriller film directed by Bilal Lashari and written and produced by Hassan Rana [...] featured Shaan Shahid, Meesha Shafi, Ali Azmat, Shamoon Abbasi, Ayesha Khan and Kamran Lashari. At the time of its release, it became the highest-grossing Pakistani film ever. This was broken by 2015 release of Jawani Phir Nahi Ani. The film depicts events surrounding the war on terror in Pakistan, including the attack on a Police Academy in Lahore in 2009. Several other films were also released between April to October including Ishq Khuda directed by Shahzad Rafique, [...] directed by Iram Parveen Bilal, Main Hoon Shahid Afridi directed by Syed Ali Raza Usama, Zinda Bhaag by Meenu Gaur and Seedlings by Mansoor Mujahid. Main Hoon Shahid Afridi was an action-drama film directed by Syed Ali Raza Usama and produced by Humayun Saeed and Shahzad Nasib. The film starred Humayun Saeed, Javed Shaikh and Noman Habib in the lead roles. Nadeem Baig, Shafqat Cheema, Ismail Tara, Ainy Jaffri, Hamza Ali Abbasi and Shehzad Sheikh also played important roles in the film, whilst Shahid Afridi and Ayesha Omar made special appearances.

[...] "A man may believe himself a Solon, or a Roland; others may {{consider}} him as a fool, or an empty braggart; {{and it must be}} taken that the general opinion of the public is the judgment from which there is no appeal. It is not the mob of Genoa only who regard the services that you have rendered as extraordinary, but it is the opinion of the councillors and authorities of the Republic, and of those who, like myself, have borne our share in warfare, that not only is the service great, but that it is due to the singular ability with which you, in command of only a single galley, have wholly destroyed or captured the fleet that threatened our commerce. As our councillors, therefore, all competent judges, are unanimous in their opinion that you have deserved the highest honours that Genoa can bestow upon you, it is useless for you to set up your own opinion to the contrary. Take the good things that fall to you, Sir Gervaise, and be thankful. It is seldom that men obtain more honours than they deserve, while it very often happens that they deserve far more than they obtain. Fortune has doubtless some share in every man's career; but when it is not once, but several times, that a knight gains special credit for deeds he has performed, we may be sure that fortune <b>has</b> <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the matter than his personal merits. Three times have you earned special credit; upon the first occasion, the grand master--no mean judge of conduct and character--deemed you worthy of secular knighthood, an honour which has not, in my memory, been bestowed at Rhodes upon any young knight; on the second, you were promoted to the command of a galley, though never before has such a command been given to any, save knights of long experience; and now, for the third time, the councillors of one of the greatest of Italian cities are about to do you honour. It is good to be modest, Sir Gervaise, and it is better to underestimate than to overrate one's own merits, but it is not well to carry the feeling to an extreme. I am quite sure that in your case your disclaimer is wholly sincere and unaffected; but take my advice, accept the honours the world may pay you as not undeserved, determining only in your mind that if you deem them excessive, you will at least do all in your power to show that they are not ill bestowed. You will not, I trust, take my counsel amiss." ...|$|E
