40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes are {{an increasing}} threat to organic farming in Germany. Especially taxa with broad host spectra and high multiplication rates such as Meloidogyne hapla and Pratylenchus spp. can cause severe damage up to total {{loss of the}} crop. The control of these nematodes is extremely difficult. Resistant cultivars are not available and only few non-host crops are known. Weed control is another important issue as most weeds are excellent hosts. In 2003 and 2004 two on-farm trials aimed at controlling M. hapla and Pratylenchus spp. were conducted in Niedersachsen, Germany. Results from these trials can be summarized as follows. For M. hapla, best control was achieved with black fallow and maize in combination with weed control. <b>Fodder</b> <b>radish</b> 'Siletina' grown as trap crop and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> 'Commodore' inhibited population increase of M. hapla. Clover/grass-mixtures and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> 'Siletina' increased population densities of M. hapla.

The simulated results of catch crops root growth and mineral N in the soil profile were validated against two years (i. e. 2006 and 2007) of observations taken in Foulum and Flakkebjerg, Denmark. <b>Fodder</b> <b>radish</b> had the deepest root system and depleted N from deeper soil layers than chicory and ryegrass. The effect of these three catch crops on N leaching and grain yield of spring barley was simulated for 30 years using the FASSET model. The simulations showed that the system with ryegrass catch crop had a smaller amount of N leaching from 1 m depth than the system with other catch crops and without catch crops. However, estimated total N leached from 2 m soil depth was the smallest in the system with <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> followed by the system with chicory, indicating that these catch crops are capable for taking soil N also from below 1 m depth.

Forty-three Brassicaceae cultivars were screened in a pot trial for their ability to reduce reproduction of three root-knot nematode isolates from north Queensland, Australia: M. arenaria (NQ 1), M. javanica (NQ 2) and M. arenaria race 2 (NQ 5 / 7). No cultivar was found to consistently reduce nematode reproduction relative to forage sorghum, the current industry standard, although a commercial <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus) and a white mustard (Sinapis alba) line were consistently as resistant to the formation of galls as forage sorghum. A second pot trial screened five commercially available Brassicaceae cultivars, selected for their biofumigation potential, for resistance to two nematode species, M. javanica (NQ 2) and M. arenaria (NQ 5 / 7). The <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> cv. Weedcheck, was found to be as resistant as forage sorghum to nematode reproduction. A multivariate cluster analysis using the resistance measurements, gall index, nematode number per g of root and multiplication for two nematode species (NQ 2 and NQ 5 / 7) confirmed the similarity in resistance between the radish cultivar and forage sorghum.

Plant growth and trace element uptake were compared under ploughing and subsoiling tillages (0. 3 m depth), the former yielding higher contamination (∼ 30 %) in top soil. Tillage choice was not critical for phytoextraction, but subsoiling enhanced above-ground productivity, whereas ploughing increased trace element concentrations in plants. <b>Fodder</b> <b>radish</b> and sunflower had the greatest aerial biomass, and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> the best trace element uptake, perhaps due to its lower root sensitivity to pollution. Above-ground removals were generally poor (maximum of 33 mg m− 2 of various trace elements), with Zn (62 %) and Cu (18 %) as main harvested contaminants. The most significant finding was of fine roots proliferation in shallow layers that represented a huge sink for trace element phytostabilisation. It is concluded that phytoextraction is generally far from being an efficient management option in pyrite waste.

40|$|AbstractDenitrification and {{leaching}} {{of nitrogen}} (N) from agriculture are {{a loss of}} nutrients to farmers and sources of pollution to water and air, and should therefore be minimized. In a field experiment on loamy soil, denitrification and N leaching were measured after late summer incorporation of <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> residues with or without paper pulp as N-immobilizing organic material. A set of relatively simple methods were used to measure and calculate denitrification and N leaching {{during the first two}} weeks after application and {{during the rest of the}} winter period. The methods were acetylene inhibition of nitrification, anion-exchange resin, the mineralization model MINIP, and inorganic-N balance calculations. Paper pulp increased N immobilization after the first day of application throughout the winter. This led to a 63 – 70 % reduction in N losses compared with the sole <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> field and with the control. Denitrification was highest in the sole <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> treatment, at 65 % of its total N losses. N leaching during the winter period was highest in the control, at 70 % of its total N losses. This N was mainly liberated by mineralization of soil organic matter after ploughing in late summer. The application of paper pulp plus <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> did not affect sugar beet yields in the next year. The methodology for determining leaching and denitrification enabled the assessment of differences among treatments. It showed clearly that paper pulp strongly reduced N losses on this type of soil. The anion resin method that was used to measure leaching during the winter period showed clear and consistent differences between treatments, but may need additional calibration before fully relying on the absolute amounts of N leached...|$|E

The ability of catch crops (Italian ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum Lam], winter rape [Brassica napus L. ] and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> [Raphanus sativus L. ]) to reduce soil sulphate concentrations in autumn and make it available to a succeeding crop was investigated in 1996 - 98 on sandy loam soil in Denmark. All catch crops reduced soil sulphate concentrations in the autumn compared to bare soil. Especially the cruciferous catch crops {{had the ability to}} deplete efficiently soil sulphate levels and thus, reduce the sulphate leaching potential. The S uptake in aboveground catch crop was 8, 22 and 36 kg S ha- 1 for ryegrass, winter rape and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> respectively. In the following spring, sulphate levels of the autumn bare soil were low in the top 0. 5 m and a peak of sulphate was found at 0. 75 - 1 m depth. In contrast, where a <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> catch crop had been grown, high sulphate levels were present in the top 0. 5 m but only small amounts of sulphate were found at 0. 5 - 1. 5 m depth. In spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), that followed catch crops, S concentrations at heading and maturity revealed that the availability of soil S increased following winter rape and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> whereas there were indications that following ryegrass, the S availability was reduced compared to bare soil.

The experimental design was randomized blocks with split-plot in time arrangement, with four replications. The parcels were the winter crops: multicropping of cover crops with black oat (Avena strigosa), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus); sunflower (Heliantus annuus) intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis; corn (Zea mays) intercropped with Urochloa; and corn; fodder radish; or wheat (Triticum aestivum) as sole crops.

40|$|This study {{relates the}} leaf CO 2 {{assimilation}} and leaf dynamics of nitrogen catch crops to environmental conditions. Winter rye (Secale cereale) and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus) were grown as catch crops in an outdoor pot experiment at two rates of nitrogen supply (N 2 higher than N 1) in Wageningen, Netherlands, from August 1993 until April 1994. Biomass increased with increasing N supply. There was no net growth after mid-November. The number of tillers in rye and of appeared leaves in radish were higher in N 2 than in N 1. Leaf appearance rate increased with temperature in <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> and rye. Tillering in rye ceased in mid-October. Leaf lifespan {{was related to}} the temperature sum between leaf emergence and leaf death. Leaf lifespan was 478 or- 68 degrees C day in <b>fodder</b> <b>radish.</b> In rye, the leaf lifespan gradually decreased from 592 or- 66 to 389 or- 25 degrees C day and from 545 (1 observation) to 401 or- 64 degrees C day in N 1 and N 2, respectively. In young leaves, Amax (light-saturated CO 2 assimilation rate) was approximately 1. 2 mg CO 2 m- 2 leaf s- 1 in September and 0. 5 mg CO 2 m- 2 leaf s- 1 later on, independent of species and N supply, N supply affected the organic N concentrations only in the older leaves. Amax was not dependent on temperature at measurement (range: 12 - 19 degrees C in September, 5 - 15 degrees C from November until March), but, in contrast, strongly related to temperature and irradiance during the preceding growth period. Leaf nitrate concentrations increased with N supply. Water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations were higher in N 1 than in N 2 and higher in rye than in <b>fodder</b> <b>radish.</b> They fluctuated during the season.

40|$|Cover crops {{grown in}} the period between two main crops have {{potential}} as {{an important component of}} a system-oriented ecological weed management strategy. In late summer and autumn, the cover crop can suppress growth and seed production of weeds, whereas the incorporation of cover crop residues in spring may reduce or retard weed emergence. Based on these two criteria, six cover crop species were evaluated for their weed suppressive potential in 2 years of experimentation in the Netherlands. <b>Fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> winter oilseed rape and winter rye had the strongest competitive ability in autumn; the competitive strength of Italian ryegrass was intermediate and white lupin and lucerne were poor competitors. Competitiveness was strongly correlated to early light interception. Surprisingly, doubling the recommended sowing density did not increase weed suppressive ability. Although a poor competitor in the fall, after incorporation in spring, lucerne had the strongest inhibitory effect on seedling establishment, followed by winter oilseed rape and white lupin. Winter rye and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> did not affect seedling establishment, whereas Italian ryegrass was not evaluated because of re-growth after incorporation.

40|$|Cover {{crops are}} a very {{effective}} erosion control and environmental conservation technique. When cover crops freeze {{at the beginning of}} the winter period, the above-ground biomass becomes less effective in protecting the soil from water erosion, but roots can still play an important role in improving soil strength. However, information on root properties of common cover crops growing in temperate climates (e. g. Sinapis alba (white mustard), Phacelia tanacetifoli (phacelia), Lolium perenne (ryegrass), Avena sativa (oats), Secale cereale (rye), Raphanus sativus subsp. oleiferus (<b>fodder</b> <b>radish))</b> is very scarce. Therefore, root density distribution with soil depth and the erosion-reducing effect of these cover crops during concentrated flow erosion were assessed by conducting root auger measurements and controlled concentrated flow experiments with 0. 1 m topsoil samples. The results indicate that root density of the studied cover crops ranges between 1. 02 for phacelia and 2. 95 kgm− 3 for ryegrass. Cover crops with thick roots (e. g. white mustard and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish)</b> are less effective than cover crops with fine-branched roots (e. g. ryegrass and rye) in preventing soil losses by concentrated flow erosion.

40|$|Eight Bombus terrestris (L.) colonies were {{reared in}} {{laboratory}} observation hives in 1986 and foraged in cages. Pollen and sugar consumption were correlated {{and could be}} estimated from larval area and number of live workers. Pollen consumption peaked within two weeks of maximum larval area in 6 - 8 week old colonies and coincided with peak worker emergence. Sugar consumption peaked {{with the emergence of}} males and queens two weeks later. The optimum period for maximum pollination efficiency for a colony would be from one week prior to peak larval area to two weeks after. There was a positive correlation between the total productivity of a colony ('Productivity Index', a biomass estimate from the number and size of empty cocoons) and the maxima of live worker numbers, larval area and rate of food consumption, and the total food consumption and biomass (but not sex ratio) of reproductives produced. Colonies with higher consumption made greater investment in reproductives, but larger colonies did not invest proportionally more into reproduction than smaller colonies. Larger colonies grew faster with more workers emerging per unit time than smaller colonies. Food consumption and development of indoor colonies was compared with ten colonies maintained in the same observation hives but free foraging outdoors on flowering crops in 1987. Maximum weekly pollen consumption was 12. 6 times less in free foraging colonies and sugar energy consumption was 43 times lower with no queens produced in colonies foraging outdoors. The pollen consumption/cm 2 at maximum larval area was 14 times lower in free foraging than indoor colonies so consumption (rate and total) for free foraging colonies could not be predicted from maximum larval area using indoor consumption data. The order of B. terrestris nectar gatherers' and queens' crop preference over the whole season was: borage, Borago officinalis > <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> Raphanus sativus > swede, Brassica napus > broccoli, Brassica oleracea. Flower preference was not correlated with flower density or production. B. terrestris males and honey bees preferred borage with broccoli as second choice. Honey bees were on average seven times more abundant on crops than B. terrestris workers and with a similar tongue length honey bees provided the greatest competition for food. On calm, warm days honey bee numbers on borage exceeded 2 /m 2, nectar and pollen became depleted and B. terrestris switched to nectar gathering on <b>fodder</b> <b>radish.</b> The long corolla tube of <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> excluded nectar collection by honey bees with a short tongue, whereas B. terrestris workers bit holes in the corolla base and 'robbed' nectar. Honey bees and B. terrestris males removed nectar from previously perforated <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> flowers. Borage secreted nectar throughout the season and had the most pollen and nectar per flower. <b>Fodder</b> <b>radish</b> had the highest flower density and pollen and nectar standing crop, producing nectar later in the season as weather improved. B. terrestris being less sensitive to poor weather, foraged for nectar and pollen each day before and after the peak in honey bee numbers. B. terrestris workers collected pollen on borage by vibrational pollen harvesting ('buzz' pollination) from poricidal-like anthers. On crucifers, incidental dusting of pollen while nectar collecting occurred.

Since 1998, as part of an Italian multidisciplinary research team on phytoremediation, we have been carrying out several agronomic investigations with field crops in agricultural soil and pyrite waste, both markedly contaminated by heavy metals. Phytoextraction was rarely an efficient process, requiring a long time even to remove merely the bioavailable metal fraction, but the great metal stock in roots suggests exploring the effectiveness of long-term in planta stabilisation. Poor above-ground productivity was the main factor constraining metal removals, especially in wastes. Without assisting the process, only zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) were harvested by the canopy in substantial amounts, with an estimated maximum of ~ 8 kg of metals from an hectare base with rapeseed in the agricultural soil and only 0. 33 kg with <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> in pyrite waste. Root growth was a key trait in species and genotype selection, in view of the close relationship between root length and metal uptake. The auxins, humic acids and chelators tested on the model plant <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> generally increased metal concentrations in plant tissues, but reduced growth and removals. It is currently concluded that phytoremediation efficiency with crop species may be improved through increased productivity by suitable soil management, involving mineral and organic fertilisation, contaminant dilution, soil capping, and metal immobilisation with inorganics and biochar. © T.

40|$|Sulphate {{leaching}} losses {{may reduce}} the long-term possibility of maintaining the S supply of crops in low input farming systems. In order to maintain a sufficient S supply in the future when further reductions in the atmospheric deposition are expected, {{it is important to}} reduce leaching losses of sulphate. As leaching primarily occurs during autumn and winter, a plant cover in this period must be expected to affect the quantity of S leached. It has been demonstrated that a catch crop succeeding the main crop can absorb nitrate from the root zone during autumn and winter and thereby reduce nitrate leaching (Thorup-Kristensen and Nielsen 1998). Similar beneficial effects of catch crops on sulphate leaching may be expected. The ability of catch crops (Italian ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum Lam], winter rape [Brassica napus L. ] and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> [Raphanus sativus L. ]) to reduce soil sulphate concentrations in autumn and make it available to a succeeding crop was investigated in a field experiment on sandy loam soil, as described by Eriksen and Thorup-Kristensen (2002). All catch crops reduced soil sulphate concentrations in the autumn compared to bare soil (Fig. 1). Especially the cruciferous catch crops had the ability to deplete efficiently soil sulphate levels and thus, reduce the sulphate leaching potential. The S uptake in aboveground catch crop was 8, 22 and 36 kg S ha- 1 for ryegrass, winter rape and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> respectively. In the following spring, sulphate levels of the autumn bare soil were low in the top 0. 5 m and a peak of sulphate was found at 0. 75 - 1 m depth (Fig. 1). In contrast, where a <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> catch crop had been grown, high sulphate levels were present in the top 0. 5 m but only small amounts of sulphate were found at 0. 5 - 1. 5 m depth. The release of S to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were investigated in pot experiments (setup described by Eriksen et al. 1995) after incorporation of the catch crops Cichorium intybus L., Medicago lupulina L., Anthyllis vulneraria L., Trifolium repens L., Pastinaca sativa L., Sanguisorba minor, Lupinus polyphyllos L., Lolium perenne L. and Raphanus sativus L. The S mineralisation rates were highest for cruciferous crops and lowest for legumes and differences were partly explained by the C/S-ratio (r 2 = 0, 49) that varied from 48 to 265 (Fig. 2). In the field, Eriksen and Askegaard (2000) found that sulphate leaching from an organic dairy crop rotation, on sandy soil was 20 kg S ha- 1 as average of 4 years or equivalent to 60...|$|E
40|$|Catch crops {{can reduce}} NO 3 losses from leaching, but {{little is known}} about the {{importance}} of deep rooting for the efficiency of NO 3 depletion. In a field experiment, we investigated the N uptake and root growth of three types of catch crops using minirhizotrons (glass tubes of 70 -mm o. d.) reaching 2. 4 m. Our purpose was to evaluate minirhizotron methodology and the importance of deep rooting in the ability of catch crops to take up NO 3 from deep soil layers. Nitrogen uptake was studied over a 6 -d period at the end of October by injection of 15 NO 3 at four depths in the ranges: 0. 4 to 1, 0. 5 to 1. 4, and 1 to 2. 5 m under Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.), and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.), respectively. The root depth of the three species were 0. 6, 1. 1, and more than 2. 4 m, respectively. No 15 N was taken up from placements below root depth, and linear relationships were found between root density and 15 N uptake from different depths. Residual soil NO 3 of 18, 59, and 87 kg N ha− 1 was left under <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> winter rye, and ryegrass, respectively. The measurements obtained with the minirhizotron method were highly relevant for evaluating N uptake from different soil layers, and root depths of the catch crops were important for N depletion. Knowledge about root growth and N uptake in deep soil layers may be utilized when designing crop rotations with improved N use efficiency. Where N has been left by a preceding crop and leached to deeper soil layers, it may be recycled by deep-rooted catch crops...|$|E

Braun) and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis) and on metal leaching in As-Co-Pb-Zn contaminated pyrites wastes. Shoot biomass, leaf area and root biomass being more affected than lenght and electrical capacitance. EEDS generally improved shoot concentration of Cu, Co, Zn and Pb but repeated treatments caused significant metal leaching (mainly of Cu), explained by a multivariate relationship (R 2 = 0. 52) including the integral over time of both leaf area (R 2 = 0. 43) and root electrical capacitance (R 2 = 0. 09). We conclude that roots play a secondary role in preventing metal leaching, because of the prevailing effect of leaf transpirationin cotrolling percolation. The best metal phytoextraction was achived with EDDS applied at harvest-a safe metal leaching strategy, expeciallyat the low dose of 2, 5 mmol per kg of soil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{goals of}} this work were to present {{original}} liquid-liquid equilibrium data of the system containing glycerol + ethanol + ethyl biodiesel from <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> oil, including the individual distribution of each ethyl ester; to adjust binary parameters of the NRTL; to compare NRTL and UNIFAC-Dortmund in the LLE representation of the system containing glycerol; to simulate different mixer/settler flowsheets for biodiesel purification, evaluating the ratio water/biodiesel used. In thermodynamic modeling, the deviations between experimental data and calculated values were 0. 97 % and 3. 6 %, respectively, using NRTL and UNIFAC-Dortmund. After transesterification, with 3 moles of excess ethanol, removal of this component until a content equal to 0. 08 before an ideal settling step allows a glycerol content lower than 0. 02 % in the ester-rich phase. Removal of ethanol, glycerol and water from biodiesel can be performed with countercurrent mixer/settler, using 0. 27 % of water {{in relation to the}} ester amount in the feed stream...|$|E
40|$|The Hillesden {{experiment}} is a farm-scale study evaluating {{the performance of}} options under Environmental Stewardship. We describe bird usage of winter seed patches (20 patches; three seed mixes) in relation to seed depletion and variation between individual patches. Seed retention declined exponentially in all three mixes; 50 % depletion occurred by late November, reaching 80 - 90 % before mid January. In mid winter, Fodder Beet retained more seed (c. 80 %) than Millet, Kale, <b>Fodder</b> <b>Radish</b> and Triticale (20 - 40 %). Bird numbers peaked in December/early January (seed depletion 70 - 90 %), but declined rapidly in late January coinciding with seed exhaustion. Seed yields varied between patches (minimum < 1 % of maximum). If all patches had performed at the maximum, yield would have increased by about 64 %. Bird counts also varied greatly between patches, but trends with seed yield were positive. At a farm-scale, winter bird abundance was significantly greater (granivorous species + 415 %) when patches were available...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Legume-based {{catch crops}} (LBCCs) may {{act as an}} {{important}} source of nitrogen (N) in organic crop rotations because of biological N fixation. However, the potential risk of high nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions needs {{to be taken into account}} when including LBCCs in crop rotations. Here, we report the results from a one-year field experiment, which investigated N availability and N 2 O emissions as affected by three LBCCs, i. e., red clover (CL), red clover–ryegrass mixture (GC) and winter vetch (WV), two non-LBCCs, i. e., perennial ryegrass (GR) and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (FR), and a control (CO) without catch crops. The effect of two catch crop management strategies was also tested: autumn harvest of the catch crop versus incorporation of whole-crop residues by spring ploughing. LBCCs accumulated 59 – 67 kg N ha− 1 in their tops, significantly more than those of the non-LBCC, 32 – 40 kg N ha− 1. Macro-roots accounted for > 33 % of total N in the catch crops. In accordance with this, LBCCs enhanced the performance of the succeeding unfertilised spring barley, thus obtaining a grain yield of 3. 3 – 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 compared to 2. 6 – 3. 3 Mg ha− 1 grain yield from non-LBCC and the fallow control treatments. Autumn harvest of catch crops, especially LBCCs, tended to reduce crop yield. The annual N 2 O emissions were comparable across treatments except for <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> which had the highest N 2 O emission, and also the highest average yield-scaled N 2 O emission, at 499 g N 2 O-N Mg− 1 grain. Although the sampling strategy employed in this study introduces uncertainty about the spatial and temporal variability, differences in seasonal emission patterns among catch crops were captured and harvest of catch crops in late autumn induced significantly higher emissions during winter, but lower emissions after residue incorporation in spring. In comparison with non-LBCC, LBCCs have the potential to partly replace the effect of manure application in organic cropping systems with greater crop production and less environmental footprint with respect to N 2 O emissions. However, harvest of the catch crops may reduce crop yield unless the harvested N is recycled as fertiliser to the crops in the rotation...|$|E
40|$|Since {{being built}} in 1990, the {{rhizotron}} facility in Wageningen, the Wageningen Rhizolab, {{has been used for}} experiments on crops (e. g. Alfalfa, Brussels sprouts, common velvet grass, field bean, <b>fodder</b> <b>radish,</b> leeks, lupins, maize, potato, beetroot, ryegrass, spinach, spring wheat, winter rye and winter wheat). In the experiments, horizontal glass minirhizotron tubes combined with auger sampling were used to assess rooting characteristics. For this paper we took the root data from these experiments and looked for a general relationship between thermal time/time after planting and rooting depth, the velocity of the root front and root proliferation. For certain depths (fixed by the depth at which the horizontal minirhizotrons were installed) a simple linear regression was established between the average root number per cm 2 minirhizotron surface area and thermal time after planting. The compartments selected for each crop were those in which there had been a control treatment and/or in which conditions for rooting were considered to be optimal. We performed regression analyses per compartment and per depth, but only for the period after planting in which a linear increase of root numbers vs. thermal time was observed. After averaging the results, the regression procedure yielded two parameters of rooting for each crop: (a) the actual or thermal time at which the first root appeared at a certain depth and (b) the root proliferation rate after the first root had appeared. In this way, inherent crop differences in rooting behaviour (rooting depth and root proliferation) became apparent. For each crop, the velocity of the root front after planting could be established (calculated in cm(°C day) - 1). This parameter differed greatly between crops. Some crops (such as leeks and common velvet grass) explored the soil profile slowly: the root front moved at a velocity of only 0. 07 cm(°C day) - 1. Among the crops whose roots grew down much faster (0. 18 - 0. 26 cm (°C day) - 1) were cereals and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish.</b> For a day with an average temperature of 15 °C these rates would have corresponded with the root front travelling approximately 1 - 4 cm per day.

40|$|Catch crops (winter rye [Secale cereale] and <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> [Raphanus sativus]) {{were grown}} on lysimeters with {{rhizotron}} facilities in Wageningen, Netherlands, from September-March (1993 - 94) and August-March (1994 - 95) {{in order to}} study root growth and water and nitrogen dynamics under different regimes of irrigation and N supply. Catch crops took up 20 - 30 g N/msuperscript 2, of which 37 - 48 % was present in dead leaves in March. Rooting depth increased by 2. 6 cm/day for both species {{at the start of}} the growing season. Catch cropping reduced the NO- 3 -N concentration in the soil considerably, initially in the top layers and then further down the soil profile. The reduction in total leached N was similar to the total crop N uptake. Nitrate-N concentrations in leached water were reduced by 49 - 85 mg/litre (62 - 99 %), depending upon N availability and irrigation. Due to catch cropping the NO- 3 -N concentration in the percolate decreased with increasing irrigation (or precipitation), whereas the amount of N leached increased with irrigation. Evapotranspiration from a catch cropped soil was close to the potential evapotranspiration under optimal growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|The root-knot {{nematode}} Meloidogyne hapla {{is a major}} pest {{in organic}} farming causing severe damage especially on vegetables. Common practices such as high cropping frequencies of legumes and low frequencies of cereals in association with unsatisfactory weed control {{are assumed to be}} major factors for nematode build-up. Due to the broad host spectrum of M. hapla strategies solely based on crop rotation are often not sufficient in controlling the nematode. A series of field experiments was conducted to develop more efficient control strategies. Based on the results a recommendation for reducing high nematode densities was developed which is build on black fallow throughout the main vegetation period buffered by additional measures such as previously growth of a overwintering legume and its incorporation early in spring before the nematode has multiplied and followed by a overwintering cereal to conserve soil nutrients and avoid erosion. In the long-term any build-up of damaging levels of M. hapla need to be avoided by a higher cropping frequency of non host crops (e. g. cereals, Tagetes), growth of catch crops (e. g. <b>fodder</b> <b>radish),</b> satisfactory weed control, short periods of black fallow to allow the soil to rest and avoidance of clover immediately before growing susceptible vegetables...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies on}} the phytomanagement of mixed-metal-contaminated land were carried out over aperiod of 10 years in an {{agricultural}} soil at Carpiano (Milan, Italy) and in pyrite waste at Torviscosa (Udine, Italy), in order to investigate the practicability of using various field crops for this purpose. Here we demonstrate that seed germination and initial growth are never critical steps under high levels of Cd or Cr, whereas poor plant productivity limits metal removal rates from contaminated waste. Phytoextraction alone was rarely an efficient remediation technology and, if the process was not chemically assisted, only Zn and Mn were accumulated above-ground in considerable amounts. A maximum of 8 kg ha− 1 of metals with rapeseed and only 0. 33 kg ha− 1 with <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> were removed from soil. Cultivation of metal-contaminated land did provide some limited opportunity for natural biofortification of crops with Zn and Cu, with no apparent risk of toxic metals in the seeds {{of only a few}} crops. Improvements in tissue metal rates achieved with auxins, humic acids or chelators were largely detrimental to biomass yield. We conclude that the efficient use of crop species in phytoremediation requires the achievement of high productivity by appropriate agricultural management involving tillage, fertilisation and perhaps also capping or dilution with clean soil. The considerable metal stock in roots suggests exploring the effectiveness of long-term stabilisation, particularly in non-tillage systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of pot trials, <b>fodder</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.) was {{cultivated}} in pyrite cinders heavily Polluted by various heavy metals (HM). The effects of application of humic acids (HA) to the cultures were evaluated at various concentrations (0. 1 and 1 g kg(- 1) of cinders) and for different methods of application (mixed with cinders before sowing; applied {{on the top of}} substrate after sowing; foliar spraying), in comparison with untreated controls. HA increased the bioavailability of various HM, especially when applied at high concentrations. Low concentrations of HA, either mixed with cinders or applied on foliage, slightly enhanced shoot growth. High levels of HA were generally phytotoxic, probably because of the ensuing higher heavy metal concentrations in the shoots. Foliar spraying was partially able to attenuate the phytotoxicity of high dosages of HA, as revealed by the increased rate of leaf expansion. A negative correlation was found between shoot biomass and concentration of HM, and higher removals were generally associated with smaller doses of HA and foliar application. Within the range of concentrations tested, humic substances led to a reduction in root diameter and an increase in specific root length (SRL, length per unit weight of roots), significant only at the highest dosage, together with a tendency towards enhancement of translocation of HM to the shoot - both positive traits for phytoremediation purposes...|$|E
