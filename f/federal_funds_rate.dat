In this study we use four competing methodologies to model and forecast the behavior of these short term <b>Federal</b> <b>Fund</b> interest <b>rates.</b> These methodologies are: time series, Taylor, econometric and neural network. The time series forecasts use only past values of <b>Federal</b> <b>Funds</b> <b>rates.</b> The celebrated Taylor rule methodology theorizes that the <b>Federal</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>rate</b> values are influenced solely by deviations from a desired level of inflation and from potential output. The econometric and neural network models have inputs used by both the time series and Taylor rule. Using monthly data from 1958 to the end of 2005 we distinguish between sample and out-of-sample sets to train, evaluate, and compare the models’ effectiveness. Our results indicate that the econometric modeling performs better than the other approaches when the data are divided into two sets of pre-Greenspan and Greenspan periods.

25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or <b>Federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>rate</b> futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E
