5000|$|The larger {{intake of}} air and the larger degree of motion also helps reduce {{the speed at which}} air enters the system and gets compacted. This is immensely useful in {{increasing}} the efficiency of the supercharger. Because, the older superchargers lost too much energy as heat and useless kinetic motion with the excessive spinning of their smaller lobes that only had 60 degrees of rotational mobility. In direct contrast, the TVS supercharger has 160 degrees of rotation in each spin and as a direct result, it does not have to spin as many times to pack the same amount of air. Thus reducing the loss of energy as heat and excessive kinetic motion produced by the rapid spinning of the rotors. The rotors and inner parts of the supercharger are also packed closer together with <b>friction</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> further helping reduce the loss of energy as heat produced by their motion. All of these design upgrades give the TVS supercharger an estimated 12% boost in efficiency in comparison to other superchargers in the market.---- ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} pressure, {{stand-off}} distance and {{time on the}} penetration of sandstones by a 0. 84 mm. jet of water was investigated. Pressures ranged up to 9000 lb/in 2 (62 MN/M 2), stand-off distances to 2 in. (5. 08 cm) and time from 0. 5 to 30 sec. The effect of using a <b>friction</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> was determined. The advantages of allowing the spent jet to escape and not interfere with penetration are demonstrated by both interrupting the jet and by rotating the target rock.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered <b>friction</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> used in plastic sheet production are the amides known as erucamide and behenamide, which despite being almost identical chemically, lead to markedly different values of the friction coefficient. To understand the origin of this contrasting behavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain molecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density Functional Theory at the B 97 D/ 6 - 31 G(d,p) level of theory. Four chains of erucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2 X 10 zigzag graphene sheet and optimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit solvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together through ππ stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located at C 13 C 14, a feature behenamide lacks and thus a more spread configuration is obtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide chains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes, compared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of cooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level interactions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread out in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions. The spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the brush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic measurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in the literature.

30|$|The use {{of liquid}} {{lubricants}} to decrease friction is an {{efficient way to}} improve energy efficiency and mechanical durability, {{especially in the case of}} magnesium and its alloys. Unfortunately, so far, there are no suitable forming fluids for the forming process of Mg alloy, even at some conditions, the forming fluid used for Al alloy forming is casually used and the result is not satisfied. The application of conventional oil-based lubricant in Al alloy forming processes relies heavily on sulfur-, chlorine-, and phosphorous-containing additives. These additives form easily sheared tribo-layers on metal surfaces, thus controlling <b>friction</b> and <b>reducing</b> wear [6]. However, the fast chemical degradation of these additives during application is accompanied by a loss of their lubrication performances. Even worse, the abovementioned additives cause negative effects on the environment even at low concentrations during the disposal of waste fluids [7]. Therefore, the exploration of the harmless lubricant with the excellent tribological performances still continues. Some efforts have already been made in order to find novel lubricant additives for magnesium alloy, such as N-containing compounds [8], borates [9], and ionic liquids [10]. All of them as lubricant additives are capable of forming tribo-layers with low shear strength to protect the contacting surfaces from damage, thereby improving the lubrication performances. Nonetheless, some problems are associated with their applications. For instance, many amide-based <b>friction</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> for lubricating oils, including straight-chain amides, are not liquid at low temperature [11]. The borate without active elements, i.e., nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine, cannot be used as good lubricant additive for magnesium alloy. Additionally, boron is an electron-deficient element and has a great affinity with oxygen borate esters susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of moisture [12]. The high cost and tedious procedure for the preparation of ionic liquids are main problems to put them into industrial application after 10  years of extensive development [13]. These disadvantages are key problems to replace the traditional phosphors- and chlorine-containing additives with the aforementioned additives.|$|R
