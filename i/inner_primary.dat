500|$|In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in {{the journal}} Science {{published}} a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx. The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis, were unable to use flapping flight. This study was criticized by Philip J. Currie and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested {{that it is difficult}} to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of [...] for the Munich specimen Archaeopteryx, a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about [...] Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved.

They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult Archaeopteryx would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the basilisk lizard, which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits (see Evolution of bird flight).|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} {{young and old}} stems of Aristolochia macrophylla has been {{investigated}} for {{a better understanding of}} how secondary growth processes cause changes in the stem anatomy of a lianescent plant. In A. macrophylla, following an increase in volume of secondary vascular tissues, the cortical tissues are deformed and the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder ruptures. Morphometric measurements prove that the inner zone of the cortical parenchymatous tissue is compressed prior to the rupture of the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. After the rupture has occurred, the radial width of the <b>inner</b> <b>primary</b> cortex slightly increases again. This could be caused by strain relaxation, suggesting that the <b>inner</b> <b>primary</b> cortex mechanically behaves similarly to cellular technical foam rubbers. Two different experiments were undertaken to test the outer cortical cylinders mechanically. The outer cortical cylinders comprise the outer sclerenchymatous cortical tissue and a collenchymatous sheath underneath the epidermis and the epidermis. In a first experiment, transverse compression loads were applied to the outside of the cortical cylinders causing ovalization of the cylinder until failure. This experiment allowed the Young's Modulus of the outer cortical cylinders to be determined. In a second set of experiments, radial hydraulic pressure was applied to the inside of the cortical cylinders, mimicking the mechanical effects of internal growth processes. The increase of the internal pressure finally led to rupture of the cortical cylinders. The circumferential stresses acting on the inner surface of the cortical cylinders were calculated. These data allow quantitative estimates of the radial and circumferential pressures effected by vascular secondary growth processes during ontogeny in A. macrophylla stems. The experimental results further indicate that the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder is the main contributor to mechanical stability of young A. macrophylla stems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe carbothermal {{reduction}} of zirconia {{has been studied}} by TEM. The starting reactants consist in carbon black and monoclinic zirconia. Two successive steps {{are involved in the}} formation of the oxycarbide. The first one leads to the formation of an oxygen rich oxycarbide compound surrounded by an amorphous covering layer that regulates the achievement of species between gas and oxycarbide. The growth is controlled by three solid-gas partial reactions corresponding either to the destabilisation of the two products or to the nucleation and growth of the oxycarbide. The oxycarbide nucleation site is strictly located within the amorphous carbon. During the second step of the process, one of the initial constituents is missing (zirconia) and the previous solid-gas equilibriums are broken. The maturation of the oxycarbide into nearly stoichiometric carbide begins. The surrounding amorphous covering layer crystallises in carbon rich secondary carbide which progressively equilibrates in composition within the <b>inner</b> <b>primary</b> one...|$|E

Initial investigations into this phenomenon seemed to undermine the hypothesis, that the formation of the inner vortex system relies on the laminar state of the boundary layer at separation onset.

This further supports the supposition of a diﬀerent generation mechanism of the inner vortical system other than a pure development out of a possibly laminar separation bubble.

40|$|We {{recorded}} {{the age of}} individual wing and tail feathers of Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma of known age and breeding status at Bird Island, South Georgia. Breeders and non-breeders of both species moult their rectrices annually. Non-breeders moult primaries biennially. In {{the first year of}} a cycle, the outer three and some <b>inner</b> <b>primaries</b> are moulted descendantly; in the next year the <b>inner</b> <b>primaries</b> are moulted ascendantly, starting from primary seven. There is a general progression to moulting equal numbers of primaries in each half of the cycle by the time breeding starts at about 10 years of age. Grey-headed Albatrosses usually moult fewer primaries than Black-browed Albatrosses, particularly as 3 -year-olds, when they undertake substantial plumage change in body moult. Most secondaries in Black-browed Albatrosses have been replaced once by age 4 years. Breeding Black-browed Albatrosses continue the moult pattern established as immatures whether they fail or not, as do failed Grey-headed Albatrosses. Successful Grey-headed Albatrosses, which breed again 16 months later, moult their three innermost primaries after breeding in the remainder of the current year and, after a period when moult is interrupted, renew the remaining primaries the following year. Comparisons between species and between failed and successful birds within species indicate that moult rate is not closely linked to the length of the interval between breeding attempts. Interspecies differences are better explained by breeding latitude, with tropical albatrosses moulting twice as fast as sub-Antarctic species, possibly reflecting food availability outside the breeding season...|$|R
