50|$|The {{marine iguana}} (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), {{also known as}} the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a species of iguana found only on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) that has the ability, unique among modern lizards, to forage in the sea, making it a marine reptile. This iguana feeds almost {{exclusively}} on algae and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone. They mainly live in colonies on rocky shores where they warm after visiting the relatively cold water or intertidal zone, but can also be seen in marshes, mangrove and beaches.|$|E

40|$|Hybridization {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the evolution of some of the vertebrate taxa on the Galapagos Islands, such as the Darwin finches. Conversely, only a single possible hybrid between the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhynchus) and the land iguana (Conolophus) has been reported from the island Plaza Sur. In this paper, the hybrid status of a morphologically unusual iguana from this island is confirmed, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Sequencing of the hybrid's mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed that it was the offspring of a female land iguana and a male marine iguana.

The Pronocephalinae comprises Pronocephalus, Ruicephalus, Neopronocephalus, Macravestibulum, Choanophorus, Cetiosaccus, and Metacetabulum. The Charaxicephalinae comprises Charaxicephalus, Desmogonius, Diaschistorchis, Pleurogonius, Iguanacola, Renigonius, Parapleurogonius, Himasomum, Pyelosomum, Cricocephalus, Barisomum, and Pseudobarisomum.

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} {{corticosterone}} {{are often used}} {{as a measure of}} “stress” in wild animal populations. However, we lack conclusive evidence that different stress levels reflect different survival probabilities between populations. <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> offer an ideal test case because island populations are affected differently by recurring El Niño famine events, and population-level survival can be quantified by counting iguanas locally. We surveyed corticosterone levels in six populations during the 1998 El Niño famine and the 1999 La Niña feast period. Iguanas had higher baseline and handling stress-induced corticosterone concentrations during famine than feast conditions. Corticosterone levels differed between islands and predicted survival through an El Niño period. However, among individuals, baseline corticosterone was only elevated when body condition dropped below a critical threshold. Thus, the population-level corticosterone response was variable but nevertheless predicted overall population health. Our results lend support to the use of corticosterone as a rapid quantitative predictor of survival in wild animal populations...|$|R
40|$|Although {{glucocorticoid}} hormones {{are considered}} important physiological regulators for surviving adverse environmental stimuli (stressors), evidence {{for such a}} role is sparse and usually extrapolated from glucocorticoid effects under laboratory, short-term and/or non-emergency conditions. <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) provide an excellent model for determining the ultimate func-tion of a glucocorticoid response because susceptibility to starvation induced by El Nifto conditions is essentially their only major natural stressor. In a prospective study, we captured 98 adult male <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> and assessed four major components of their glucocorticoid response: baseline corticosterone titres; corticosterone responses to acute stressors (capture and handling); the maximal capacity to secrete corticosterone (via adrenocorticotropin injection); {{and the ability to}} terminate corticosterone responses (negative feedback). Several months after collecting initial measurements, weak El Nifto conditions affected the Galapagos and 23 iguanas died. The dead iguanas were typified by a reduced efficacy ofnega-tive feedback (i. e. poorer post-stress suppression of corticosterone release) compared with surviving iguanas. We found no prior differences between dead and alive iguanas in baseline corticosterone concen-trations, responses to acute stressors, nor in capacity to respond. These data suggest that a greater ability to terminate a stress response conferred a survival advantage during starvation...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the cost}} of mate choice is an {{essential}} component of the evolution and maintenance of sexual selection, the energetic cost of female choice has not previously been assessed directly. Here we report that females can incur high energetic costs as a result of discriminating among potential mates. We used heart rate biologging to quantify energetic expenditure in lek-mating female <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). Receptive females spent 78. 9 +/- 23. 2 kJ of energy on mate choice over a 30 -day period, which is equivalent to approximately (3 / 4) of one day's energy budget. Females that spent more time on the territories of high-quality, high-activity males displayed greater energetic expenditure on mate choice, lost more mass, and showed a trend towards producing smaller follicles. Choosy females also appear to face a reduced probability of survival if El Niño conditions occur in the year following breeding. These findings indicate that female choice can carry significant costs, and suggest that the benefits that lek-mating females gain through mating with a preferred male may be higher than previously predicted...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} sequences {{belonging to}} Ty 1 -copia group retrotransposons from the genomes of an amphibian (Pyxicephalus adspersa) and three reptiles (Conolophus subscristatus, Amblyrynchus cristatus and Pytas mucosus). Two different sequences {{were found in}} the amphibian (Tpa 1 and Tpa 2). Each is present in several copies per genome and absent from the genomes of two other amphibian species. The C. subcristatus sequence Tcs 1 is present in multiple copies in both its host genome (Galapagos land iguana) and the genome of the related <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (A. cristatus). There is little or no polymorphism in Tcs 1 insertions between different individual animals, suggesting that this sequence is not transposing rapidly in either iguana genome. The P. mucosus sequence Tpm 1 shows a discontinuous distribution in snake species, suggesting that it has either been lost from many lineages during vertical germline transmission or has been transferred horizontally in some snake species. Phylogenetic comparisons of all these sequences {{with each other and with}} other members of this retrotransposon group from other animals and plants show that sequences within a particular vertebrate species are most closely related to each other, consistent with a vertical transmission model for their evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Vibrio isolates {{was investigated in}} cloacal swabs from the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhyncus cristatus). Such unique iguana is endemic to the Galápagos Archipelago, it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List (2009), and is strictly protected by CITES and Ecuador laws. Our results revealed an uneven isolation frequency of vibrios from animals living in different settings: maximal among the Santa Fe population, scarce at Bahía Tortuga but practically absent in the samples from Puerto Ayora and Plaza Sur. A 16 S sequencing confirmed that the isolates belonged to the genus Vibrio, placing them within the V. alginolyticus group; the biochemical identification was, indeed, consistent with V. alginolyticus features. The reason of the observed discrepancy is not clear, but could be either linked to a higher pollution in the inhabited or more touristic places or to differential influence of chemical and physical parameters at a local scale. As V. alginolyticus is an opportunistic pathogen for man and it is known to cause disease in sea-living animals, the ability of these vibrios to enter and persist {{to a certain extent}} in the marine iguana gut should be regarded as a risk for health of both the animals and the human personnel involved in monitoring activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the direct {{interaction}} between hybridization and speciation-two major contrasting evolutionary processes [...] are poorly understood. We present here the evolutionary history of the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) and reveal a case of incipient within [...] island speciation, which is paralleled by between-island hybridization. In-depth genome-wide analyses suggest that Amblyrhynchus diverged from its sister group, the Galápagos land iguanas, around 4. 5 million years ago (Ma), but divergence among extant populations is exceedingly young (less than 50, 000 years). Despite Amblyrhynchus appearing as a single long-branch species phylogenetically, we find strong population structure between islands, and one case of incipient speciation of sister lineages within the same island [...] ostensibly initiated by volcanic events. Hybridization between both lineages is exceedingly rare, yet frequent hybridization with migrants from nearby islands is evident. The contemporary snapshot provided by highly variable markers indicates that speciation events may have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of marine iguanas, though these events are not visible in the deeper phylogenetic trees. We hypothesize that the observed interplay of speciation and hybridization might be a mechanism by which local adaptations, generated by incipient speciation, can be absorbed into a common gene pool, thereby enhancing the evolutionary potential of the species as a whole...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Changes in mate {{selectivity}} {{can significantly}} alter {{the direction and}} strength of sexual selection. When the direct cost of mate search increases selectivity often declines; however, {{little is known about}} how the relative cost of mate search affects investment in mate choice. Here, I investigate whether male and female <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) alter their investment in mate choice behaviors when resources are limited and the relative cost of mate search is increased. Moderate resource limitation had little effect on male reproductive behavior: in both years, a similar number of males were territorial, and the mean display rate and copulation success of territorial males did not differ. In contrast, female mate search appeared to be affected by the prevailing environmental conditions. During the reproductive season following a moderate El Niño event, when food availability declined, females were in poorer body condition, assessed fewer territorial males, and mated with a male with lower relative reproductive success. Circulating hormone levels also differed between years: when resource availability was limited, receptive females had higher levels of testosterone and stress-induced cortico-sterone. The frequency and magnitude of climatic fluctua-tions are expected to increase in the future across many regions of the globe. Determining how sexual selection is shaped by changes in resource availability is vital for predicting the impact of climate change...|$|R
40|$|Because {{global warming}} is {{predicted}} {{to increase the severity}} of El Niño events in the future, understanding how warmer temperatures affect seaweed growth and the animals associated with seaweeds is important for predicting how marine ecosystems will change. The Galapagos Islands of Ecuador are considered a living laboratory for studying climate change and served as the experimental site for this study. An artificially induced average increase in temperature by 1. 45 °C significantly decreased seaweed biomass in the intertidal of Tortuga Bay, Santa Cruz Island. The experiment utilized a block design with six treatments. Treatments consisted of 15 cm x 15 cm black (warm) and white (cool) plates to cause differential thermal stress, cross-factored with herbivore exclusion cages to study the effects of grazing, and a natural substratum control. Thermal stress (plate color) and grazing were both significant factors reducing seaweed biomass. Abundance, richness, and diversity of invertebrate animals living among the seaweeds showed declines in warmer treatments. Effects on small animals could reflect intolerance to thermal stress, loss of habitat (seaweed), or both, and future studies should investigate these factors. These results indicate that warmer conditions due to human induced climate change can decrease seaweed growth and affect animals that rely on seaweeds for food or habitat, possibly including the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana.</b> Insight from the Galapagos might help predict seaweed response to climate change in other regions including the temperate Pacific Northwest...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the proximate environmental cues {{that influence the}} timing of reproduction in the seasonally and synchronously breeding <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). Marine iguana foraging patterns are {{closely linked to the}} tidal cycle, and they feed exclusively on macroalgae. The Galápagos Islands are characterized by seasonal currents that impact water temperature and ultimately algal abundance, which is known to affect iguana body condition and survival. In our study, marine iguanas preferred Gelidium sp., which had the highest nutritional quality (nitrogen content, carbon content, and C:N ratio) of the three species of macroalgae on which they feed. Nutritional quality in Gelidium changed predictably with increasing sea surface temperature, peaking around the median iguana copulation date. Similarly, foraging behavior changed around the time copulations began. To test if consistent relationships existed among food quality, water temperature, and breeding life history, we used seven years of data from this population and found that breeding occurred earlier in years when the mean December sea surface temperature was warmer. Although iguanas might cue directly on changes in sea surface temperature, given the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the Galápagos, this hypothesis is unlikely. Rather, our results suggest that marine iguanas may use subtle changes in food quality (particularly energy content) associated with seasonal, but annually variable, changes in water temperature as a cue to initiate breeding. The excess available energy may be used to withstand the costly breeding period, as well as to provision yolk to improve hatchling growth and survival...|$|E
40|$|Males of many {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} flexible reproductive phenotypes and must decide before each mating season whether to adopt sneaker, satellite, or territorial mating tactics. How do males gauge their abilities against {{others in the}} population? We tested experimentally whether hormone [...] behavior feedback loops allow <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> males to activate their three behavioral phenotypes as predicted by the relative plasticity hypothesis. Territorial males defended small mating areas and had significantly higher plasma testosterone (T) levels (75 � 11 ng/ml) than did satellite males that roamed around territories (64 � 8 ng/ml) or sneaker males that behaved like females within territories (43 � 11 ng/ml). In territorial males, temporary pharmacological blockade of T slowed head-bob patrolling, decreased territory size threefold, and {{reduced the number of}} females on territories 20 -fold. This supports previous data that females may gauge male attractiveness by using head-bob patrolling, here shown to be a T-dependent trait. Control-treated neighbors reacted to the weakening of T-blocked males by increasing head-bob rate fivefold and territory size 1. 6 -fold, and female numbers increased 2. 5 -fold. Unmanipulated or control-injected males remained unchanged. Behavioral effects were partly reversed after 7 days. T injections induced satellite males to establish temporary territories, even at unconventional locations. Some T-boosted satellite males suffered serious fighting injuries. T-injected sneakers left female clusters and behaved like larger satellite males that roam around territories. Thus, territorial and mating tactics are activated by T, but experimental (de-) activation at the wrong ontogenetic stage is costly: manipulated males switched phenotype but thereby lowered their access to females. We hypothesize that T levels of males that are based on early-season behavioral interactions influence a males' subsequent phenotypic role.

40|$|We studied {{patterns}} of genetic diversity within and among 5 populations (318 individuals) of <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) {{from the island}} Santa Fé. Populations were separated by distances of 0. 2 to 9. 9 km. We sequenced 1182 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region and screened 13 microsatellite loci for variability. We also added data from 5 populations (397 individuals) sampled on 4 neighboring islands (Santa Cruz, Floreana, Espanola, and San Cristobal). The 5 Santa Fé populations, revealed as genetically distinct from populations on other islands, present relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which are similar for both microsatellite (average observed heterozygosity from 0. 7686 to 0. 7773) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers (haplotypic and nucleotide diversity from 0. 587 to 0. 728 and from 0. 00079 to 0. 00293, respectively), and comparable with those observed in similar-sized sampling sites on other islands. There was frequency-based evidence of genetic structure between northern and southern sites on Santa Fé (F st of 0. 0027 – 0. 0115 for microsatellite and 0. 0447 – 0. 2391 for mtDNA), but the 4 southern sites showed little differentiation. Most of the intra-island genetic variation was allocated within rather than between sites.

40|$|Body size {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} traits of organisms and allows predictions of an individual's morphology, physiology, behaviour and life history. However, explaining the evolution of complex traits such as body size is difficult because a plethora of other traits influence body size. Here I review what we know about the evolution of body size in a group of island reptiles and try to generalize about the mechanisms that shape body size. <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> occupy all 13 larger islands in this Pacific archipelago and have maximum island body weights between 900 and 12   000  g. The distribution of body sizes does not match mitochondrial clades, indicating that body size evolves independently of genetic relatedness. <b>Marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> lack intra- and inter-specific food competition and predators are not size-specific, discounting these factors as selective agents influencing body size. Instead I hypothesize that body size reflects the trade-offs between sexual and natural selection. We found that sexual selection continuously favours larger body sizes. Large males establish display territories and some gain over-proportional reproductive success in the iguanas' mating aggregations. Females select males based on size and activity and are thus responsible for the observed mating skew. However, large individuals are strongly selected against during El Niño-related famines when dietary algae disappear from the intertidal foraging areas. We showed that differences in algae sward (‘pasture’) heights and thermal constraints on large size are causally responsible for differences in maximum body size among populations. I hypothesize that body size in many animal species reflects a trade-off between foraging constraints and sexual selection and suggest that future research could focus on physiological and genetic mechanisms determining body size in wild animals. Furthermore, evolutionary stable body size distributions within populations should be analysed to better understand selection pressures on individual body size...|$|R

40|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a {{major source}} of climatic disturbance, {{impacting}} the dynamics of ecosystems worldwide. Recent models predict that human-generated rises in green-house gas levels will cause an increase in the strength and frequency of El Niño warming events in the next several decades, highlighting the need to understand the potential biological consequences of increased ENSO activity. Studies have focused on the ecological and demographic implications of El Niño in a range of organisms, but there have been few systematic attempts to measure the impact of these processes on genetic diversity in populations. Here, we evaluate whether the 1997 - 1998 El Niño altered the genetic composition of <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> populations from eleven islands, some of which experienced mortality rates of up to 90 % as a result of El Niño warming. Specifically, we measured the temporal variation in microsatellite allele frequencies and mitochondrial DNA diversity (mtDNA) in samples collected before (1991 / 1993) and after (2004) the El Niño event. Based on microsatellite data, only one island (Marchena) showed signatures of a genetic bottleneck, where the harmonic mean of the effective population size (N(e)) was estimated to be less than 50 individuals during the period between samplings. Substantial decreases in mtDNA variation between time points were observed in populations from just two islands (Marchena and Genovesa). Our results suggests that, for the majority of islands, a single, intense El Niño event did not reduce marine iguana populations to the point where substantial neutral genetic diversity was lost. In the case of Marchena, simultaneous changes to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation may also be the result of a volcanic eruption on the island in 1991. Therefore, studies that seek to evaluate the genetic impact of El Niño must also consider the confounding or potentially synergistic effect of other environmental and biological forces shaping populations...|$|E
40|$|Background Chemical {{signals are}} widely used in the animal kingdom, {{enabling}} communication in various social contexts, including mate selection {{and the establishment of}} dominance. Femoral glands, which produce and release waxy secretions into the environment, are organs of central importance in lizard chemical communication. The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a squamate reptile with a lek-mating system. Although the lekking behaviour of marine iguanas has been well-studied, their potential for sexual communication via chemical cues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the diversity of the lipophilic fraction of males’ femoral gland secretions among 11 island populations of marine iguanas, and compare it with the composition of its sister species, the Galápagos land iguana (Conolophus subcristatus). We also conducted behavioural observations in marine iguana territorial males in order to explore the possible function of these substances in the context of male dominance in leks. Methods Femoral secretions were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) in order to characterise the lipophilic composition. To understand the potential role of femoral secretions in marine iguana intraspecific communication, territorial males were sampled for their femoral glands and monitored to record their head bob rate—a territorial display behaviour in males—as well as the number of females present in their leks. Results We found that the gland secretions were composed of ten saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids ranging in chain length between C 16 and C 24, as well as three sterols. Cholesterol was the main compound found. Intriguingly, land iguanas have a higher diversity of lipophilic compounds, with structural group of lipids (i. e. aldehydes) entirely absent in marine iguanas; overall the chemical signals of both species were strongly differentiated. Lipid profiles also differed among populations of marine iguanas from different islands, with some islands demonstrating a high diversity of lipophilic compounds (i. e. full spectra of compounds), and others lacking one or more compounds. Among the compounds most frequently found missing were 11 - and 13 -eicosenoic acids. Gland secretions of males with a better body condition and with a higher dominance status (i. e. those accompanied by females and with higher head bob display) were proportionately richer in C 20 -unsaturated fatty acids (11 -eicosenoic acid). Discussion Land and marine iguanas strongly diverged in their chemical composition of the femoral glands likely due to ecological differences between both species. Despite that marine iguana populations varied in their femoral gland composition that was not related to their genetic structure. Our results indicated that 11 -eicosenoic acid may {{play an important role in}} intraspecific chemical communication in marine iguanas...|$|E

The existence of a now-drowned Galápagos archipelago 14. 5 Ma considerably increases speciation times for the Galápagos biota and provides a complete solution to a long-standing controversy concerning the divergence of the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>marine</b> and land <b>iguanas</b> from a single ancestral species...|$|R

40|$|The currently-accepted {{determined}} ages of {{the emergent}} Galapagos Islands are not old enough {{to allow for the}} speciation of the terrestrial life present upon them, including <b>marine</b> and terrestrial <b>iguanas.</b> The discovery of drowned and subducted seamounts off the coast of Costa Rica and magnetic signature data from these seamounts suggest that they were once emergent portions of the Galapagos Island chain. If terrestrial biota existed upon the seamounts while they were emergent and before the present Galapagos Islands emerged, the amount of time possible for speciation is increased to an amount within the margin of error for the genetic distance between the two iguana species. The Origin of Galapagos Island Seamounts and the Impact of Their Discovery on Accepted Tectonic and Speciation Models The emergent Galapagos Islands are around three million years old, which is ample time for the speciation of the thirteen species of finch found there by Darwin. This is not enough time, however, to explain the divergence of the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>marine</b> and land <b>iguanas</b> from a single South American species, based on the calculated genetic distances between the two. The discovery of seamounts off the coast of Costa Rica, thought to be representative of drowned islands, could be a possible explanation for the speciation of the iguanas. These seamounts have been dated between 5 and 14. 5 million years old, which would be ample time for this speciation, assuming that the iguanas did originate from a single South American species. Geologic data show that the drowned archipelago remained over the Galapagos hotspot longer than the present emergent Galapagos Islands, and therefore existed as an island chain for a longer amount of time, allowing longer time for speciation of life on the islands.

50|$|Broadcast 11 November 1998, {{this episode}} {{examines}} those birds whose sustenance comes from flesh and their methods of hunting. In New Zealand, Attenborough observes keas, parrots {{that do not}} eat meat exclusively, raiding a shearwater's burrow for a chick. However, it is the dedicated birds of prey, such as owls, buzzards, eagles, falcons and vultures, to which much of the programme is devoted. In order to spot and pursue their victims, senses of sight and hearing are very acute. Vultures are the exception, in that they eat what others have left, and once a carcass is found, so many birds descend on it that the carrion seems submerged beneath them. The turkey vulture is an anomaly within its group, as {{it also has a}} keen sense of smell. Eagles defend their territory vigorously, and a pair of sea eagles are shown engaging in an aerial battle. The <b>Galápagos</b> hawk hunts <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas,</b> but can only do so when its quarry is vulnerable, during the breeding season. The African harrier-hawk has adapted to extracting burrowing animals by virtue of an especially long, double-jointed pair of legs. By contrast, a shrike is not equipped with the requisite sharp beak and talons needed for butchery, and so dismembers its kill by impaling it on the thorns of acacias. The lammergeier eats bones, and will drop them on to rocks from a great height in order to break them down to a digestible size. Also featured are the Eurasian sparrowhawk, goshawk and peregrine falcon.|$|R
50|$|Introduced predators, {{to which}} they have little or no protection, include animals such as pigs, dogs, cats and rats. Dogs may take adult <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas,</b> while the others may feed on their young or eggs. This {{inhibits}} reproduction and the long-term survival of the species. Among the few natural predators are Galápagos hawks, short-eared owls, lava gulls, herons and Galápagos racer snakes that may take small <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas.</b> Of the native predators, the hawk is likely the most important, but <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> have anti-predator strategies that reduce its impact.|$|R
