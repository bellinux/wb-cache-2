5000|$|Idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "Leukopathia symmetrica progressiva") {{is a very}} common {{acquired}} disorder that affects women more frequently than men, presenting with skin lesions that occur chiefly on sun exposed regions of the skin, suggesting sun exposure may play a role.|$|E
40|$|We present {{three cases}} {{of a rare}} eruptive variant of tumor of {{follicular}} infundibulum. Two patients presented with hypopigmented macules. The clinical differential diagnoses considered in these two cases were vitiligo, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, and idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis.</b> In the third case, the lesions were hypopigmented flat topped maculo-papules diagnosed clinically as verruca plana. In all three cases, the histopathological features of plate like growth of pale keratinocytes connected to the epidermis and peritumoral condensation of elastic fibers were diagnostic. Although no satisfactory treatment is available, the exclusion of other clinical differential diagnosis particularly vitiligo with its psychosocial implications {{underscores the importance of}} skin biopsy...|$|E
40|$|Biopsy {{findings}} in 55 cases of idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> (IGH) are reported. Most cases had a flat epidermis with {{loss of the}} rete pattern and a thickened orthokeratotic basket weave stratum corneum. The epidermis had markedly decreased to absent melanin in the basal layer and reduced numbers of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. One-third of patients had a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas the rest had no significant dermal inflammation. These findings are in concordance with current literature. However, small foci of retained melanin in the basal layer (skip areas) alternating with larger areas of melanin loss were present in almost 80 % of cases. This finding has not been reported earlier {{and appears to be}} quite specific to IGH and may be used as a clue to differentiate IGH from other similar conditions such as vitiligo and guttate morphea...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 320 {{patients}} {{of more than}} 60 years of age were studied for dermatological changes with aging. The male female ratio of patients was 3 : 1. Majority of cases (60. 6 &#x 0025;) were between 60 - 65 years of age. Pruritus was present in 37. 5 &#x 0025; cases, wrinkles in 82. 1 &#x 0025;, senile lentigenes in 57. 8 &#x 0025;, seborrhoeic keratosis in 48. 8 &#x 0025;, cherry angioma in 48. 1 &#x 0025;, idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> in 43 &#x 0025;, skin tags in 37 &#x 0025;, xerosis in 28 &#x 0025;, comedones in 19 &#x 0025;, infection and infestation in 40 &#x 0025;, eczematous disorders in 36. 9 &#x 0025;, papulosquamous disorders in 10 &#x 0025;, metabolic disorders in 16 &#x 0025;, pigmentary disorders in 8. 7 &#x 0025;, keratinisation disorders in 4. 1 &#x 0025;, vesiculobullous disorders in 2. 8 &#x 0025; and associated systemic disorders in 49. 7 &#x 0025; cases...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH) is a {{cutaneous}} pigmentary disorder {{resulting from}} a deficit of melanin and manifesting with disseminated hypopigmented macules. Pityriasis alba, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis), bacterial and fungal infections, neoplasms, vitiligo, piebaldism, nevus anemicus and idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> {{are included in the}} differential diagnosis. No commonly accepted therapeutic recommendations have been published so far; topical antibiotics, phototherapy and oral isotretinoin have been described in the literature. Objective. To present our own cases of PMH – a dermatosis which is somewhat common in the general population but is still diagnosed infrequently in clinical practice. Case report. We present two cases of PMH – a 33 -year-old woman and a 38 -year-old man in whom the diagnosis of PMH was established due to clinical examination and excluding other causes. The patients were treated with oral isotretinoin. Conclusions. Dermatologists should be aware of this entity; despite presenting with a somewhat benign course, PMH may pose a serious issue for the affected patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Depigmented skin lesions are {{of great}} concern in the society, {{especially}} in the Indian subcontinent. These comprise many infective and inflammatory conditions that cause apprehension and anxiety among patients due to the social stigma attached to these conditions. Idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> (IGH) appears similar to many depigmented lesions and differentiation of IGH from these conditions is difficult clinically as well as histopathologically. Methods: Clinically suspected IGH {{were included in the}} study. All IGH lesions were confirmed by histopathology. Clinical data and dermoscopic patterns were analyzed and presented in proportions and percentages. Results: Thirty patients were included in the study with 16 females and 14 males. Dermoscopy showed amoeboid, feathery, petaloid and nebuloid patterns in 12, 7, 6 and 1 patients respectively. Four patients had combination of these patterns. Conclusion: Dermoscopy of IGH revealed consistent patterns. Hence, we propose these patterns were specific to IGH and help clinician to differentiate many depigmented skin lesions from IGH in clinical practice. However, histopathology must be done for confirmation of diagnosis. Further studies on dermoscopy of IGH with histopathology correlation are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Two hundred {{geriatric}} patients, aged 55 {{years and}} above, studied at Medical College, Berhampur accounted for 3 &#x 0025; of Skin & VD OPD attendance {{with a male}} preponderance (M: F: 4 : 1). Majority (97 &#x 0025;) of these patients were literate, 55 &#x 0025; belonged to low socio-economic group. Among them 32. 5 &#x 0025; of males were farmers and all females were housewives. Forty-nine dermatologic diseases were encountered, twenty-nine patients presented with multiple complaints and the rest had single complaint. Pruritus was the commonest symptom (54 &#x 0025;), 41. 5 &#x 0025; of which was associated with different dermatoses and the rest 12. 5 &#x 0025; with senile xerosis. Fungal infection was the commonest dermatosis. Senile xerosis (12. 5 &#x 0025;), seborrhoeic keratosis (10 &#x 0025;), psoriasis (9 &#x 0025;), idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> (6. 5 &#x 0025;), malignant and premalignant conditions (5 &#x 0025;), vitiligo (3. 5 &#x 0025;) and lichen planus (3 &#x 0025;) {{were some of the}} other dermatoses seen.

40|$|Background: There are few {{population-based}} {{studies on}} prevalence of cutaneous problems in diabetes mellitus. Aims: To identify skin {{problems associated with}} diabetes mellitus among elderly persons in a village in Kerala. Methods: In this population-based cross-sectional survey, we compared the prevalence of skin problems among 287 elderly diabetics (aged 65 years or more) with 275 randomly selected elderly persons without diabetes mellitus. Results: Numbness, tingling and burning sensation of extremities,“prayer sign”, finger pebbling, skin tags, stiff joints and acanthosis nigricans were noted more frequently in diabetics as compared to non-diabetics. Ache in extremities, dermatophytosis, candidiasis, seborrheic keratoses/dermatosis papulosa nigra, xerosis/ichthyosis, idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis,</b> nonspecific itching, and eczema were equally frequent in both groups. Among the diagnostic categories, neurovascular, metabolic and autoimmune findings were associated with diabetes mellitus, whereas bacterial and fungal infections were not. Limitations: Initial misclassification errors, no laboratory confirmation of dermatological diagnosis during survey, coexistence of findings related to aging and not analyzing the effects of glycemic level, concurrent diseases and medications. Conclusions: Numbness, tingling and burning sensation of extremities, prayer sign, finger pebbling, skin tags, stiff joints and acanthosis nigricans were associated with diabetes mellitus among elderly persons in a village in Kerala...|$|E
40|$|Context: Therapeutic {{wounding}} includes wounding {{the skin}} to induce pigmentation of the depigmented skin patches that was earlier used for repigmenting small patches of stable vitiligo. In this study, we have used the same principle to induce pigmentation in idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis</b> (IGH) by spot peel with 88 % phenol. Aims: To study the efficacy of phenol in causing repigmentation in IGH and its adverse effect profile. Settings and Design: Open prospective study. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with 139 IGH macules were subjected to spot peel. Eighty-eight percent phenol was applied with an ear bud once a month for two sittings. Patients were assessed both subjectively and objectively after every session {{and at the end}} of 3 months of initiation of therapy. Results: Repigmentation was noted in 64 % of IGH macules. More than 75 % improvement was seen in 45 % of the total IGH macules, while 41. 5 % showed 50 - 75 % improvement at the end of three months. Persistent scabbing was the common adverse effect noted in 17. 26 % of lesions. Conclusion: Spot peel with 88 % phenol is a safe, simple, cost-effective, outpatient procedure for IGH, which can be combined with other medical therapies...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, dermoscopy {{has been shown to}} be a useful tool in {{assisting}} the noninvasive diagnosis of various general dermatological disorders. In this article, we sought to provide an up-to-date practical overview on the use of dermoscopy in general dermatology by analysing the dermoscopic differential diagnosis of relatively common dermatological disorders grouped according to their clinical presentation, i. e. dermatoses presenting with erythematous-desquamative patches/plaques (plaque psoriasis, eczematous dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, mycosis fungoides and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus), papulosquamous/papulokeratotic dermatoses (lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, papulosquamous sarcoidosis, guttate psoriasis, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, classical pityriasis rubra pilaris, porokeratosis, lymphomatoid papulosis, papulosquamous chronic GVHD, parakeratosis variegata, Grover disease, Darier disease and BRAF-inhibitor-induced acantholytic dyskeratosis), facial inflammatory skin diseases (rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, discoid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, lupus vulgaris, granuloma faciale and demodicidosis), acquired keratodermas (chronic hand eczema, palmar psoriasis, keratoderma due to mycosis fungoides, keratoderma resulting from pityriasis rubra pilaris, tinea manuum, palmar lichen planus and aquagenic palmar keratoderma), sclero-atrophic dermatoses (necrobiosis lipoidica, morphea and cutaneous lichen sclerosus), hypopigmented macular diseases (extragenital guttate lichen sclerosus, achromic pityriasis versicolor, guttate vitiligo, idiopathic <b>guttate</b> <b>hypomelanosis,</b> progressive macular hypomelanosis and postinflammatory hypopigmentations), hyperpigmented maculopapular diseases (pityriasis versicolor, lichen planus pigmentosus, Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, Dowling-Degos disease, erythema ab igne, macular amyloidosis, lichen amyloidosus, friction melanosis, terra firma-forme dermatosis, urticaria pigmentosa and telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans), itchy papulonodular dermatoses (hypertrophic lichen planus, prurigo nodularis, nodular scabies and acquired perforating dermatosis), erythrodermas (due to psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, pityriasis rubra pilaris and scabies), noninfectious balanitis (Zoon's plasma cell balanitis, psoriatic balanitis, seborrheic dermatitis and non-specific balanitis) and erythroplasia of Queyrat, inflammatory cicatricial alopecias (scalp discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia and folliculitis decalvans), nonscarring alopecias (alopecia areata, trichotillomania, androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium) and scaling disorders of the scalp (tinea capitis, scalp psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis amiantacea) ...|$|E
