5|$|Another example {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxin. CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is inserted into a linearised plasmid vector. A short extra sequence <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gene of interest that activates the antitoxin when the insertion occurs. This method ensures orientation-specific gene insertion.|$|E

5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|Gold, a siderophile, is most {{commonly}} recovered by dissolving the ores {{in which it}} is found in a cyanide solution. The gold forms a dicyanoaurate(I), for example: 2 Au + H2O +½ O2 + KCN → 2 K + 2 KOH. Zinc <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mix and, being more reactive than gold, displaces the gold: 2 + Zn → K2 + 2 Au. The gold precipitates out of solution as a sludge, and is filtered off and melted.|$|E

5|$|If time runs short {{during a}} game, the show {{goes to a}} 50/50 round. In the 50/50 round the {{remaining}} questions of that game are asked in a multiple-choice fashion, with two possible answers given. Contestants who answer incorrectly at this point have credit for the question (and the given letter, if applicable) automatically given to their opponent; however, no money <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank for that question.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|In {{this process}} lead bullion and slag is {{obtained}} directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide. Carbon (coke or coal gas) <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> molten charge along with fluxing agents. The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead, {{in the midst}} of a slag rich in lead monoxide.|$|E
50|$|A coastal battery <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{tower in}} 1715 to house two 18-pounder guns. Buttressing <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{lower half of}} the {{structure}} in around 1761.|$|R

5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in nitric acid, and a reducing agent (FeSO4, or H2O2) <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium {{remains in the}} form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E

5|$|Tute {{games are}} played until an {{established}} number of game points is reached. Each {{time one of}} the competitors wins a round, one point <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.|$|E
5|$|A man on an {{international}} flight injects himself with an insulin pen, which releases a biological agent that quickly kills everyone aboard by causing their flesh to crystallize. The airplane's autopilot system lands the plane at Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create {{a task force to}} investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> barn <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974; it was {{the first}} round barn in <b>the</b> state <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Register.|$|R

50|$|Initially it was {{believed}} that Ogilvy's name could not <b>be</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain London Monument but after support from a company, <b>the</b> name <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bronze panel.|$|R
5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) {{which are}} associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
