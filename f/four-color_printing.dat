He was rebuffed by an official who said, [...] "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're {{going to use}} fine arts men, real artists." [...] However, Saturday Evening Post editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized {{the potential of the}} set and encouraged Rockwell to produce them right away. By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that Freedom from Want [...] did not match Bulosan's text. [...] In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine {{was on the verge of}} being compelled by the government to place restrictions on <b>four-color</b> <b>printing,</b> so Rockwell had better get the work published before relegation to halftone printing.|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman lived {{close to}} the World Trade Center site, which was known as [...] "Ground Zero" [...] after the September 11 attacks that {{destroyed}} the World Trade Center. [...] Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja's school, where Spiegelman's anxiety served only to increase his daughter's apprehensiveness over the situation. [...] Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of The New Yorker which at first glance appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. [...] Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower's antenna breaks into the [...] "W" [...] of The New Yorkers logo. [...] The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard <b>four-color</b> <b>printing</b> inks with an overprinted clear varnish. [...] In some situations, the ghost images only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source. [...] Spiegelman was critical of the Bush administration and the mass media over their handling of the September 11 attacks.|$|E

Since {{it was first}} published in 1967, the magazine has received numerous awards and recognitions. The Spring 1984 issue featured writing by a number of outside authors, notably Anne Bernays, Ray Bradbury, Art Buchwald, then Vice President George H. W.

5000|$|The {{resulting}} finished print, whether {{composed of}} several layers and in full color or having {{only a single}} monochrome layer, exhibits a very slight bas-relief effect and a variation of texture on its surface, both distinctive characteristics of a carbon print. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Each color carbon print requires three, or four, round trips in the darkroom to create the finished print. An individual, using existing pigmented sheets and separations, can prepare, print and process enough material, 60 sheets including the support, to produce about twelve 20" [...] x 24" [...] <b>four-color</b> <b>prints</b> in a 40-hour work week.

50|$|The {{practice}} of Pointillism is {{in sharp contrast}} to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the <b>four-color</b> CMYK <b>printing</b> process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.|$|R

In <b>four-color</b> rotogravure <b>printing,</b> long rolls of newsprint are fed to the press four separate times, one for each color. The ability to align the feeds longitudinally and laterally is critical to quality control, as any misalignment results in color gaps, or colors bleeding to spaces they were not intended to cover.

50|$|Artists {{generally}} use {{inkjet printing}} to make reproductions {{of their original}} two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or computer-generated art. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color offset lithography process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than $50, not including scanning and color correction, compared to $5 for a <b>four-color</b> offset litho <b>print</b> of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having {{to be set up}} and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not {{have to pay for the}} expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large <b>four-color</b> offset <b>print</b> runs. This allows the artist to follow a just-in-time business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used, and it is even feasible for individual artists to own and operate their own printers.|$|R

50|$|Full color cards, or {{cards that}} use many colors, are printed on sheetfed presses as well; however, {{they use the}} CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) <b>four-color</b> <b>printing</b> process.

5000|$|The [...] "K" [...] in CMYK {{stands for}} key because in <b>four-color</b> <b>{{printing}},</b> cyan, magenta, and yellow printing plates are carefully keyed, or aligned, {{with the key}} of the black key plate. Some sources suggest that the [...] "K" [...] in CMYK comes from the last letter in [...] "black" [...] and was chosen because B already means blue.

50|$|World Color {{computerized}} {{many aspects}} of its business in the 1960s, providing the company with more efficient production and distribution capabilities, {{as well as the}} ability to perform more complicated printing procedures and reproduce more complex data. In 1969, World Color started construction of a web-offset facility in Effingham, Illinois, approximately 120 miles northeast of Sparta. The new plant was designed to produce magazines printed on coated paper with extensive use of <b>four-color</b> <b>printing.</b> Success in this arena led to a 1971 expansion of the Effingham plant that nearly doubled its original size. The 1971 addition increased the company's ability to produce large-circulation monthly magazines printed on letter-press equipment.|$|E
