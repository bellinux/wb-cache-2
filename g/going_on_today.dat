50|$|When {{looking at}} {{mental health care}} access, it is {{important}} to recognize the inequality to access that different races and ethnicities have. It is known through much research that even poor minorities have less access to mental health care than poor non-Latino whites. In addition to that research, it is also known that blacks have even less of a chance to access to mental health services and care than those who are white. This is an important issue to address due to many of the movements <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in <b>today’s</b> society. Recently racism has been apparent in the U.S. and many of these minorities may confront an issue directly resulting in the search for mental health care support, yet they don’t have the same access as other people.|$|R

50|$|The first written {{evidence}} of a prohibition of the carnival dates from 1695, when the principality of Malmedy was governed by prince-abbots. The local authorities feared that this celebration could encourage public disorder since it was assimilated to pagan rituals.

In the 20th century the carnival was prohibited on three occasions: during {{the two world wars}} and in 1962 during a smallpox epidemic.

40|$|Since {{quite a few}} years, {{philosophy}} is heading towards the bedside of the patient: the practice of philosophy has stepped out of its ivory tower, it seems, to deal with empirical or practical questions. Apart from the advantages, we {{should keep in mind}} the importance of a critical analysis of medical or clinical practice as such. If ethics partakes the clinical stage, it runs the risk only to discuss the how question and to forget the more fundamental what or why questions: what are we doing exactly and why is it good for? Starting from the principle of the empowerment of the patient, we will demonstrate how the discourse on empowerment in health care seems to forget a profound reflection upon this principle as such. By rehearsing some basics from the governmentality theory of Michel Foucault and the actualization of it by Nicolas Rose, we will argue how philosophical investigation in medical-ethical evolutions such as empowerment of the patient is still needed to understand what is really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in <b>today's</b> clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20 th century, it was quite common among {{philosophers}} ranging from the logical empiricists to existentialists like Sartre and Heidegger to regard ethics as beyond rational justification. These tendencies are found even today, mostly among scientists who have not followed the developments in philosophy, but also among postmodernists and some other philosophers who seem to be unaware of what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in philosophy <b>today.</b> This paper outlines how the picture has changed from the early part of the century to now. Central figures in this development have been Nelson Goodman, Israel Scheffler and John Rawls. However, many of their ideas were interestingly anticipated by earlier philosophers, notably Edmund Husserl. This essay focuses on the issues rather than on the people. Its aim is to give a fairly accurate picture of the present situation with regard to justification in ethics. ...|$|R
