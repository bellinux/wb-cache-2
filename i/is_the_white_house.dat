2500|$|Another example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> {{located at}} 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, {{is located at}} 16th Street NW (Lafayette Square) and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. This works both ways; an address at 514 19th St NW would be on 19th St west of the Capitol, and since E is the fifth letter of the alphabet, the 514 address would be between E and F Streets NW. [...] Because J is omitted from the scheme, it is not counted in numbering. Thus, the 900 block is in between I and K Streets, and the 1000 block is in between K and L Streets (even though K is the 11th letter of the alphabet).|$|E
2500|$|Many guests {{appear on}} the show expressing a variety of points of view on diverse social and {{political}} topics. Some guests proffer progressive views similar to Hartmann's, but more than half are conservatives, libertarians, or Ayn Rand Institute members who espouse opposing views. Due to his eagerness to invite people who disagree with him, vigorous discussion and debate between the host and guests usually ensues; [...] "My goal in my conversations with conservatives is not to create a spectacle, and not to win the argument, not to prove that I'm the smartest guy in the room or that I'm a tough warrior and I can smack down people." [...] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appears every Friday during the first hour of the show titled [...] "Brunch with Bernie".
