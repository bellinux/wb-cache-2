The shepherds will benefit economically from the sheep because they can, for instance, sell their wool. Each shepherd faces the financial decision whether it would be more profitable to purchase another sheep to feed on the Common and <b>extract</b> <b>wool</b> for, or provide more food to each sheep by sticking with the current herd. Given that it is free to feed the sheep on the Common and the reduction in available food is marginal, it turns out that it is always optimal for a selfish shepherd trying to optimize his profit to buy another sheep. This has the effect of driving the Common into a slump where eventually no more grass is available and all sheep die and all shepherds go bankrupt.|$|E
40|$|Raw <b>wool</b> fibers were <b>extracted</b> with CO 2 with {{different}} organic modifiers (acetone, ethanol and methanol) at constant pressure and temperature. The influence of experimental extraction {{conditions on the}} properties of <b>extracted</b> <b>wools</b> was studied to determine the suitability of the fibers for textile applications. Suitable wool wax removal from raw wool fibers was qualitatively evaluated by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy observation {{as well as by}} whiteness, yellowness and brightness measurements. Moreover, the possible bulk fiber modification as a consequence of internal wool lipid extraction belonging to the cell membrane complex was assessed by determining the bursting resistance and dyeing behavior. The results suggest that both CO 2 /ethanol and CO 2 /methanol extraction methods provide well-scoured wool fibers with an acceptable dyeing behavior, the bulk modification being negligible.

40|$|The {{wool scale}} {{present on the}} fiber surface gives rise to certain {{unwanted}} effects in textile wet processing. The effects, for example, include felting and poor wettability. In the past, the removal of scale was done either by surface modification through physical/chemical degradation of scale or by deposition of a polymer on the scale. In modern treatment, combination of both methods is usually carried out. Since the deposition of a polymer on the fiber surface depends much on the surface characteristics of the fiber, therefore, the required surface property of modified fiber {{is an important factor}} for polymer application. On the other hand, the surface modification methods may also result in improved wettability on the surface of fiber. The present study investigated the surface physico-chemical properties of wool fiber subjected to different surface modification treatments. In this study, Soxhlet <b>extracted</b> (dichloromethane <b>extracted)</b> <b>wool</b> fibers (21 μm diameter) were modified by low temperature treatment using different plasma gases, namely oxygen, nitrogen, and 25 % hydrogen and 75 % nitrogen gas mixture.

40|$|Bleached {{wool felt}} {{was chosen as}} a {{substitute}} for human hair to avoid complications due to natural pig-ment. Pieces were dyed by immersion in lawsone or henna suspension, and their colors assessed using a Lovibond tintometer and a Hunterlab colorimeter. With lawsone, immersion for 30 minutes was sufficient to dye the wool. The hue and intensity of the color developed id not change significantly when the pH was varied between 3 and 5, in contrast to the electronic spectra of lawsone solutions, in which absorbance decreased progressively with decreasing pH. Below pH 6 the color of the wool varied little with pH and was predominantly red, but above pH 6 the intensity decreased and the yellow component became pre-dominant. At pH 4. 5 the intensity of the red component increased with dyeing temperature between 15 and 50 øC, and became progressively more predominant. The color developed with henna increased with temperature, and also with time, probably because time was required to extract coloring matter from the plant tissue. In contrast to lawsone, henna gave a color which was predominantly yellow and had a greater blue component over the whole pH range. Both factors were attributed to the chlorophyll content. Sub-stantivity was tested by extracting felts with water and measuring the absorbance of the extract after timed intervals. The extraction rate was unaffected by dyeing time, pH, or temperature.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} enzymes on wool top. Wool top was incubated with proteases SP 655, SP 656, SP 490 {{as well as with}} lipase SP 398. The changes in wool morphology that occurred {{as a result of the}} enzyme treatment were shown by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. On the basis of the morphological results protease SP 655 was chosen for further experiments to improve the wool properties like handle, dyeing, shrink resistance and whiteness. Wool cortex and cuticle are not significantly changed after treatment with protease SP 655 over a period of 1 h. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. By contrast, the densitogram of merino wool treated with protease SP 655 over a period of 6 h, showed no more peaks in the area of the low sulfur proteins with a molecular weight of 45 - 50 kD, but an increase of peak number in the area of the low molecular weight proteins. The handle of merino wool was improved by enzyme treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 % over a period of 1 h at 57 °C. Moreover 72 % of the testing persons found that the softness of crossbred wool increased after this enzyme treatment compared to the reference sample. The felting of merino wool top is not reduced by the enzyme treatment described above. The felting of crossbred wool, however, was significantly reduced after enzyme treatment in comparison to the reference fibres and untreated crossbred wool. The shrink resistance of merino wool is significantly improved only after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 %. A further decrease of felting was achieved by enzyme treatment in sodium borate/HCl-buffer. The felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/HCl-buffer is significantly lower in comparison to the felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/acetate-buffer. The felting results of merino wool after different treatment times showed that the felt density decreases with treatment time. Non-extracted wool felts significantly more compared to <b>extracted</b> <b>wool</b> top after enzyme treatment. The modification of merino wool fibres is very high after increasing the enzyme concentration and the treatment time. The modification of non-extracted wool top after enzyme treatment is distinctly smaller compared to wool top, which was extracted before. The degree of whiteness of enzyme treated wool top, such as merino and crossbred wool, is generally higher than that of the respective reference samples and of untreated wool top. After enzyme treatment, the whiteness of non-extracted wool top is significantly higher than the whiteness of <b>extracted</b> <b>wool</b> top. A higher protease SP 655 concentration on wool top does not cause a further improvement of the degree of whiteness. The tensile strength of merino and crossbred wool is not influenced by treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 owf in borate/acetate buffer. The tensile strength of merino wool decreases significantly after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 owf compared to untreated wool top. The results of a new test method developed for measuring the buckling force of fibre bundles showed that significant differences in the buckling force of wool bundles with varying fibre diameter can be measured. By contrast, the values obtained when using this test method on enzyme-treated wool samples varied widely. Dyeing tests with Lanasol Blue 8 G at 98 °C and 50 °C showed that the enzyme treated wool samples are darker stained in comparison to the reference samples. The dye uptake of the enzyme treated samples is higher and faster than that of the reference samples. Using the dyestuffs Acid Red 88 -II and Food Red 5 with a smaller molecular weight in comparison to Lanasol Blue 8 G no significant difference is found between the dye uptake of the enzyme treated wool fibres and the reference fibres...|$|R

Monoclonal {{antibodies}} that recognize {{components of}} the low-sulfur keratin proteins <b>extracted</b> from Merino <b>wool</b> {{have been used to}} locate these components within the wool follicle. Immunoblotting procedures showed that all of the monoclonal antibodies bound more than one of the eight low-sulfur protein components, indicating that these proteins have antigenic determinants in common. Immunofluorescence studies showed that those antibodies specific for the component 7 family of the low-sulfur proteins bound to the developing wool fiber, whereas those antibodies recognizing the component 8 family bound to areas throughout the wool follicle, particularly the inner and outer root sheaths, but also to the fiber, the cuticle, and the epidermis.

40|$|Nowadays {{the waste}} from protein fibres {{represents}} an important renewable source {{for a new}} generation of biomaterials and promising competitors for carbohydrate based biomaterials. Regenerated keratin biomaterials are biodegradable in vivo and in vitro, biocompatible, and support cell attachment and proliferation; however, their major drawback has been their weak mechanical properties such as ductility.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns {{itself with}} the sorption behaviour of wool concerning some important interior air pollutants. Apart from the intake of toluol as an organic substance frequently provable in high concentrations in the interior air, the sorption and possible reactivity of several aldehydes were examined. The emphasis of the investigation is on formaldehyde {{as the most important}} and most frequent aldehyde occurring in interiors. Under static conditions of 22 °C wool takes up large quantities of formaldehyde from the gaseous phase. The sorption follows a first order kinetic. The sorption activity rises with increasing relative humidity and falling pH-value. The intake quantity after long exposition times however is not altered by relative humidity or low pH. We have thus a kinetic effect which leads to a rise of the velocity coefficient by a factor of 6. 6 at a relative humidity between 30 and 90 %. Desorption experiments could demonstrate that the release of formaldehyde is decelerated and that wool fibre has a high retention capability. The release of formaldehyde decreases with rising retention time (reaction time) in the fibre. The relative amount of hydrolytically separable formaldehyde also depends on the reaction time in the wool and continues to diminish after long reaction times (eight months). A possible explanation of these results is a varying bond strength of formaldehyde to the amino acids of wool proteins. Apart from the physical bond there is a reaction of formaldehyde with proteins via the intermediate stages of methylol bonds and bases to irreversible methylene bonds. The formation of these stable methylene derivatives takes place over several months under typical conditions (22 °C, 56 % relative humidity and pH-value 7, 6. The formation can be accelerated by higher temperature and a lower pH-value of the wool. It could be shown through electrophoretic fractioning of <b>extracted</b> <b>wool</b> proteins that the relative humidity has little influence on the formation of methylene interlacing. A rise of the temperature to 50 °C however leads to strong interlacing after a short time. At 22 °C it takes a long reaction time with the wool protein to reach a distinct increase of interlacing. This is accelerated by an acidic pH-value of the wool. The interlacing of the wool proteins starts in the intermediary filaments (IF) and extends to the other morphologic components of the cortex when the exposition temperature or the concentration are increased. The non ceratinic parts of the wool fibre are also linked by formaldehyde. This can be shown by the decrease of the enzymatical degradability of the fibre proteins through the enzymatical alloy Pronase...|$|R

Two different dyeing methods were used: premordanting (MD) and simultaneous mordanting (M+D) procedures. In order to evaluate the influence of the mordant ion in the brazilein chromophore photodegradation, samples were subjected to artificial light ageing. Color measurements were made and, for the first time, LC-DAD-ESI-MS was used for chromophore analysis of the dyed fibers before and after light exposure. Mordant ion quantification was done after fiber acid digestion, by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Mordant metal ion, mordant bath concentration and dyeing procedure were found to have strong influence in the wool fiber hues. Color variation was more pronounced in the alum dyed samples. Overall, mordant quantification showed that the amount of metal ions found in the fibers is very small when compared to the original concentrations of the dyeing bath, being Cu the ion with greater affinity for the wool fibers.

The epithelial injury was assessed by measuring 51 Cr release from cells as an indication of lysis, and by monitoring cells which had detached from the substratum. No significant injury to A 549 cells was caused by culture with any of the dusts collected from the air but surface "ledge" dust caused significant lysis at some doses. Quartz, used as a toxic control dust, caused significant lysis at the highest concentration of 100 micrograms/well. To determine whether any injurious material was soluble the dusts were incubated in saline and extracts collected. No extracts caused significant injury to epithelial cells. A similar lack of toxicity was found when 51 Cr labelled control alveolar macrophages were targets for injury. Significant release of radiolabel was evident when macrophages were exposed to quartz at concentrations of 10 and 20 micrograms/well, there being no significant injury with either wool or grain dusts.

40|$|Materials {{research}} {{was aimed at}} finding specific characteristics, which could indicate the provenance of mural paintings uncovered in Bishops castle in Lidzbark Warmiński, northeast Poland. An expected relation of these murals to Bohemian artistic workshops, which were active in the 14 th century at the Emperor Charles IV’s court in Prague, was supported by further exact data. The lead-tin yellow – type II was identified by X-ray microdiffraction; {{up to the present}} day, this uncommon modification of the pigment was proved solely in the Bohemian painting of the 14 th century (e. g. Master of Třeboň altarpiece) and in the Italian painting of the 14 th to 16 th century. Nickel is an element accompanying natural iron-based pigments and was found both in the painting and the drawing, respectively. It is possible to demonstrate that this admixture indicates the source locality of the pigment in Lower Silesia, which belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 14 th century and was exploited for chrysoprases – green gemstones frequently appearing in Bohemian jewellery and wall decorations (St. Wenceslas chapel in the Prague’s cathedral, Karlštejn Castle). Lidzbark murals exhibit features similar to the panel painting, e. g. the use of tempera, natural chalk in the preparatory layer, lead pigments and madder lakes in the painting. The madder was <b>extracted</b> from the <b>wool</b> fibres, which are still clearly visible in the samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of eight different procedures {{used for the}} extraction of natural dyes was evaluated using contemporary wool samples dyed with cochineal, madder, woad, weld, brazilwood and logwood. Comparison was made based on the LC-DAD peak areas of the natural dye’s main components which had been <b>extracted</b> from the <b>wool</b> samples. Among the tested methods, an extraction procedure with Na 2 EDTA in water/DMF (1 : 1, v/v) {{proved to be the}} most suitable for the extraction of the studied dyes, which presented a wide range of chemical structures. The identification of the natural dyes used in the making of an eighteenth century Arraiolos carpet was possible using the Na 2 EDTA/DMF extraction of the wool embroidery samples and an LC-DAD-MS methodology. The effectiveness of the Na 2 EDTA/DMF extraction method was particularly observed in the extraction of weld dye components. Nine flavone derivatives previously identified in weld extracts could be identified in a single historical sample, confirming the use of this natural dye in the making of Arraiolos carpets. Indigo and brazilwood were also identified in the samples, {{and despite the fact that}} these natural dyes were referred in the historical recipes of Arraiolos dyeing, it is the first time that the use of brazilwood is confirmed. Mordant analysis by ICP-MS identified the widespread use of alum in the dyeing process, but in some samples with darker hues, high amounts of iron were found instead...|$|R
40|$|The growth hormoe (GH) gene is a {{candidate}} for growth in sheep, since {{plays an important role in}} growth regulation and development (Boyd & Bauman 1989). Most genetic studies on the growth of sheep have concentrated on birth weight, weaning weight and yearling weight (Bathaei & Leroy 1998). Pereira et al. (2005) found significant effect for bovine growth hormone (bGH) genotype on yearling weight. Tambasco et al. (2003) observed a positive association between genotype LV and daily body weight gain from weaning to yearling in Bos Taurs x Bos indicus crosses. Wool traits like greasy fleece weight, clean yield, fiber diameter and its coefficient of variation are very important selection goals in sheep breeding programs, however new traits such as staple strength and staple length are of increasing importance in the wool industry (Forgarty 2006). Initial observations using daily injections of crude pituitary <b>extracts</b> showed that <b>wool</b> growth decreased by 17 % during the second treatment period (Ferguson 1954). Allain et al. (1998) found segregation for coefficient of variation of fiber diameter and staple length on chromosomes 3 and 4 in a composite sheepline (INRA 401). Zel sheep is raised in North of Iran. This sheep is a native non-fat tailed breed with small-sized (Saadat-Noori & Siah-Mansoor 1990). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between GH genotypes and wool traits and yearling weight using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method in Zel sheep...|$|R
40|$|Following an {{application}} from Roxlor Nutra LLC, submitted pursuant to Article 13 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924 / 2006 via the Competent Authority of Belgium, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) {{was asked to}} deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to Cynatine® and maintenance of normal joint mobility. The Panel considers that Cynatine®, which is a keratin powder <b>extracted</b> from sheep <b>wool,</b> is sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect proposed by the applicant refers to “joint flexibility”. The Panel considers that maintenance of normal joint mobility is a beneficial physiological effect. The applicant presented one unpublished human intervention study as being pertinent to the health claim. The Panel notes that the study was specifically designed to identify patients with clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis, and considers that normal cells and tissues are genetically (gene expression) and functionally different from osteoarthritic cells and tissues, and therefore may respond differently to interventions with exogenous substances. In addition, the mechanisms involved in the onset and/or progression of osteoarthritis are largely unknown. It would have to be established, therefore, that an intervention which has an effect on the progression of the disease (in patients with osteoarthritis) would also have an effect on its onset (subjects without the disease). The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this study for the scientific substantiation of the claim. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of Cynatine® and maintenance of normal joint mobility...|$|R
40|$|Macrophage pseudopodia that {{surround}} objects during phagocytosis contain a meshwork of actin filaments and exclude organelles. Between these pseudopodia {{at the base}} of developing phagosomes, the organelle exclusion ceases, and lysosomes enter the cell periphery to fuse with the phagosomes. Macrophages also extend hyaline pseudopodia on the surface of nylon wool fibers and secrete lysosomal enzymes into the extracellular medium instead of into phagosomes. To analyze biochemically these concurrent alterations in cytoplasmic architecture, we allowed rabbit lung macrophages to spread on nylon wool fibers and then subjected the adherent cells to shear. This procedure caused the selective release of β-glucoronidase into the extracellular medium and yielded two fractions, cell bodies and isolated pseudopod blebs resembling podosomes, which are plasma-lemma-bounded sacs of cortical cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic extracts of the cell bodies eluted from nylon fibers contained two-thirds less actin-binding protein and myosin, and approximately 20 percent less actin and two-thirds of the other two proteins were accounted for in podosomes. The alterations in protein composition correlated with assays of myosin-associated EDTA-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity, and with a diminution in the capacity of <b>extracts</b> of nylon <b>wool</b> fiber-treated cell bodies to gel, a property dependent on the interaction between actin-binding protein and F-actin. However, the capacity of the remaining actin in cell bodies to polymerize did not change. We propose that actin-binding protein and myosin are concentrated in the cell cortex and particularly in pseudopodia where prominent gelation and syneresis of actin occur. Actin in the regions from which actin-binding protein and myosin are displaced disaggregates without depolymerizing, permitting lysosomes {{to gain access to the}} plasmalemma. Translocation of contractile proteins could therefore account for the concomitant differences in organelle exclusion that characterize phagocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Different {{methods for}} the {{extraction}} of Dactylopius coccus Costa, Rubia tinctorum L., Isatis tinctoria L., Reseda luteola L., Curcuma longa L. and Cotinus coggygria Scop. from wool fibres are investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The efficiencies of five extraction methods which {{include the use of}} HCl (widely used extraction method), citric acid, oxalic acid, TFA and a combination of HCOOH and EDTA are compared {{on the basis of the}} (a) number, (b) relative quantities, measured as HPLC peak areas and (c) signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of the compounds <b>extracted</b> from the <b>wool</b> substrates. Flavonoid glycosides and curcuminoids contained in R. luteola L. and C. longa L., respectively, according to liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identifications, are not detected after treating the fibres with HCl. All the other milder methods are successful in extracting these compounds. Experiments are performed using HPLC-DAD to compare the HPLC peak areas and the S/N of the following extracted compounds: indigotin, indirubin, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, fisetin, sulfuretin, luteolin, luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside, apigenin, carminic acid, alizarin, puruprin and rubiadin. It is shown that the TFA method provides overall the best results as it gives elevated extraction yields except for fisetin, luteolin, apigenin and luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside and highest S/N except for fisetin and luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside. It is noteworthy that treatment of the fibres with the typical HCl extraction method results overall in very low S/N. The TFA method is selected for further studies, as follows. First, it is applied on silk dyed samples and compared with the HCl method. The same relative differences of the TFA and HCl methods observed for the wool dyed samples are reported for the silk dyed samples too, except for rubiadin, luteolin and apigenin. Thus, in most cases, the nature of the substrate (wool or silk) appears to have negligible effects on the relative difference of the two extraction methods. Second, the selected TFA method is applied to treat wool and silk historical samples extracted from textiles of the Mamluk period, resulting in the identification of several colouring compounds. In all extraction methods mentioned above, DMSO is used to dissolve the dyes, after acid treatment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
