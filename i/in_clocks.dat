This signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally, or sent to a display unit.

40|$|Recently, {{businesses}} have started using MapReduce {{as a popular}} computation framework for processing large amount of data, such as spam detection, and different data mining tasks, in {{both public and private}} clouds. Two of the challenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for MapReduce configuration parameters e. g., number of mappers, number of reducers, and DFS block size, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that a user should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both choosing configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely the users responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision the total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a MapReduce job, a profile of total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles is built from the job past executions with different values of two configuration parameters e. g., number of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is used to model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input data scaling on measured total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles. This derived model along with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate the accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim MainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles of generated resource provisioning options are less than 8 % of the measured total CPU usage <b>in</b> <b>clock</b> cycles <b>in</b> our 20 -node virtual Hadoop cluster.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} this {{behavior}} was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called entrainment or mode locking in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums have been used <b>in</b> <b>clocks</b> and were widely used in gravimeters in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as [...] "death" [...] states wherein one or both clocks stops.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} clock movement, {{the verge}} escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100°. Huygens showed {{this was a}} source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock's drive force. [...] To make its period isochronous, Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal 'chops' next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc. [...] This solution didn't prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum's swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were isochronous [...] motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum swing <b>in</b> <b>clocks</b> to 4°–6°.|$|E
2500|$|The {{timekeeping}} {{elements in}} all clocks, which include pendulums, balance wheels, the quartz crystals used in quartz watches, {{and even the}} vibrating atoms in atomic clocks, are in physics called harmonic oscillators. The reason harmonic oscillators are used <b>in</b> <b>clocks</b> is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific resonant frequency or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely 'sharp'. [...] Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of frequencies (or periods), called the resonance width or bandwidth, where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate. [...] In a clock, the actual frequency of the pendulum may vary randomly within this resonance width in response to disturbances, but at frequencies outside this band, the clock will not function at all.|$|E

2500|$|Pendulums <b>in</b> <b>clocks</b> (see example at right) {{are usually}} {{made of a}} weight or bob (b) [...] {{suspended}} by a rod of wood or metal (a). [...] To reduce air resistance (which accounts {{for most of the}} energy loss in precision clocks) [...] the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock. In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see Accuracy below). A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is [...] [...] Instead of hanging from a , clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring (d) of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's restoring force. A few precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the crutch, (e), which ends in a fork, (f) whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's escapement, (g,h).|$|E
