500|$|Tunis' next novel, Go Team Go, set in 1954, {{returns to}} Indiana basketball. Again a coach risks {{the support of}} fans by cutting players, {{including}} the team star. The hero, Tom Williams, comes to see that his coach was right, and gets his father's respect – and the girl – by helping the new team move forward. Buddy and the Old Pro is a 1955 novel about Pop Warner football. Tunis disliked organized sports for young children, saying [...] "I've always believed Little League is harmful to the extreme.

Little boys should be playing their sports by themselves." [...] In what Michelle Nolan in Ball Tales calls a [...] "remarkable book", Tunis uses his only non-Dodgers baseball novel to emphasize a favorite theme when the young protagonist admits to his father [...] "it's better to lose, much as it hurts, than to play dirty".|$|E

2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel {{had anything to}} say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I {{have to say that}} I have been found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even according to the law of England.

2500|$|There are {{two things}} to which I am devoted: {{absolute}} academic and spiritual freedom, and the subordination {{of the state to}} the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability—as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations. This means a devotion to principles of true democracy. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> the sea trip strongly. A sea trip does {{you good}} when {{you are going to}} have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is wicked.|$|R
60|$|The man in {{the corner}} {{had been trying to}} worry me into a {{conversation}} for some time. He had asked me if <b>I</b> <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> having the window open. He had said something rather bitter about the War Office, and had hoped <b>I</b> did not <b>object</b> <b>to</b> smoking.

6000|$|... "For all that, in a way, {{there was}} some truth in the story; enough, in fact, to make it dangerous, and I think you have been rash. Bob has been here too often, and you will {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>objected</b> <b>to</b> his coming." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{particularly}} {{object to}} the new position which the avowed principle of this Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> it because it assumes {{that there can be}} moral right in the enslaving of one man by another. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> it as a dangerous dalliance for a free people--a sad evidence that, feeling prosperity, we forget right; that liberty, as a principle, we have ceased to revere. <b>I</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it. The argument of [...] "necessity" [...] was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery; and so far, and so far only, as it carried them did they ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they could not help, and they cast blame upon the British king for having permitted its introduction.|$|E
