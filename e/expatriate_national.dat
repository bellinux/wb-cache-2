40|$|AbstractTransfer of {{knowledge}} through <b>expatriate</b> <b>nationals</b> (TOKTEN) initiative is a UNDP technical assistance modality that aims at human resource capacity building {{in countries that}} suffer from brain-drain. One of the main constraints that impede maximum contribution of human resource development programs towards sustainable development is lack of gender-sensitivity. TOKTEN initiative is believed to overcome this constraint. Thus, this paper will examine this thesis in the Sudanese setting. Data were collected from 46 trainees who attended a training workshop arranged through TOKTEN initiative. t-Test {{was used to examine}} the difference in the level {{of knowledge}} of the male and female trainees about the different concepts and topics under consideration before and after the workshop. The study results reflected a significant improvement in the trainees’ level of knowledge with {{no significant difference between the}} mean level of knowledge of the male and female trainees. Thus, the main advantage of TOKTEN initiative is its’ capability to build human resource capacity in patriarchal societies without inducing gender disparity. Consequently, TOKTEN initiative should be promoted and expanded particularly in resource poor and patriarchal societies...|$|R

This categorization {{is also likely to}} affect HCN willingness to provide role information and social support to expatriates. Overall, our results suggest that HCNs {{would be more likely to}} provide role-related information to subordinates and peers than supervisors, and social support to male peers regardless of their nationality (i. e.

40|$|Effective {{performance}} of expatriates is recognised {{as a major}} determinant in {{the success or failure}} of organisations. The literature on expatriate management emphasises that the intercultural adjustment and intercultural communication competence of the expatriates, as well as cross-cultural training for the expatriates and the family/spouse, are important indicators for expatriates' effectiveness. In addition, it has been shown that expatriates who develop network ties with host nationals can adjust to a foreign environment more easily than those who do not. However, there has been no empirical study regarding this in Thai government organisations. The purpose of this exploratory, qualitative study is to determine the factors affecting the {{performance of}} the expatriates working with the Ministry of Labour (MOL) in Thailand and to propose suggestions to the MOL on how to better manage the expatriates working for them. Drawing on a number of intercultural adjustment and intercultural communication theories, the Map, Bridge, Integrate (MBI) model is utilised to unpack the cultural differences between <b>expatriates</b> and host <b>nationals.</b> The strength of ties, based on social network theory, is drawn on to explain the pattern of relationships between <b>expatriates</b> and host <b>nationals.</b> A Pilot study, using an email questionnaire with eight United Nations (UN) and Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) expatriates working with the MOL, was conducted to refine the adequacy of the reference and data collection strategies. The semi-structured, in-depth interviews were then carried out to examine the attitudes and perceptions of expatriates about their adjustment and adaptation to the cultural diversity that impinges on their performance. The participants were 14 international expatriates working with the MOL during the time of data collection. All interviews were tape recorded, transcribed and analysed using interpretive content analysis, discourse analysis, and protocol analysis. This empirical study provides robust evidence that besides the factors deliberately investigated in this study, there are many other factors that influence expatriates performance when working in different cultures. It was found that these expatriates understand cultures more than they had before they came to Thailand. However, the degree of adjustment and accomplishment they varied, partly resulting from personality characteristics and their home country values. Subsequently, the themes emerging from the findings - the personality characteristics of the <b>expatriates</b> and <b>national</b> values - are also discussed. Furthermore, this study will provide guidance to the Thai government about what to consider when receiving international expatriates into their organisations and how to manage cultural diversity in their workplace. Finally, this study proposes some ideas for future research...|$|R
