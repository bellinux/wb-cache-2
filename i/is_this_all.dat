500|$|Music for Captain Scarlet was {{composed}} by Barry Gray, an innovator in electronic music, who had scored all the Supermarionation series preceding it. The opening title sequence theme, [...] "The Mysterons", was rendered electronically {{and accompanied by}} a staccato drum beat to introduce the lead character of Captain Scarlet. This seven-note beat was also used to link scenes within episodes, and to cut to advertisement breaks, {{for which it was}} accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo as designed by Tony Dunsterville of the art department. On the subject of the beat, Anderson recalls, [...] "When I went to the recording session, I heard the drum beat he had come up with and I thought, 'Christ, <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>all</b> he could produce?' Looking back on it, however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well." ...|$|E

[...] The author added that [...] "there is a brilliant scene at customs with Dom trying to translate what the gang are saying and getting it all completely wrong!" [...] Bowden later praised the [...] "banter" [...] between the group, adding that she found one of Dom's scenes [...] "absolutely hilarious". She felt that the storyline was [...] "so ridiculous" [...] that it was difficult to take it seriously although she commended the entertainment value of the scenes. Bowden praised the return of previous cast members during the series, saying it brought back [...] "great nostalgic memories".|$|E
