5000|$|In this paradigm, {{doctors would}} in effect be {{treating}} population risk rather than individual risk factor thresholds as is current mainstream practice. So, if everyone {{were given a}} relevant kind of polypill, the average blood pressure and cholesterol levels in the population would fall, thus reducing overall population risk. Perhaps ironically, this is in a sense going {{in the opposite direction}} from personalized medicine, since mass-produced or fixed-dose-combination polypills are in some tension with the goals of personalized medicine, due to the [...] "fixed" [...] nature of the [...] "dose combinations." [...] Proponents of this population-focused approach contend that the advantages of drug consolidation can outweigh any reduction in personalization of drug and/or <b>dose</b> <b>selection.</b> Also, depending on the demographic distribution and market size, there may be room for some different alternative versions of certain general FDCs to be manufactured with differences in their respective dosages and/or drugs. A widely distributed polypill could contain three blood pressure medications at low dose: a diuretic, such as hydrochlorothiazide, a beta-blocker such as atenolol, and an ACE inhibitor such as lisinopril; and these could be combined with a statin such as simvastatin, aspirin at a dose of 75 mg, and folic acid, which has been shown to reduce the level of homocysteine in the blood, which is another risk factor for heart disease.|$|E

The Committee on Risk Assessment Methods of the National Research Council attempted, but failed, in 1993 to reach {{consensus}} on how to select doses for chronic rodent bioassays. However, a more recent effort conducted by the ILSI Risk Science Institute has resulted in a consensus set of principles for <b>dose</b> <b>selection,</b> including selection of the highest dose for chronic rodent bioassays. The principles encourage a move away from sole reliance on a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as it has been traditionally defined (primarily by body weight and histopathology), and toward the use of sound scientific and toxicologic principles for the selection of all doses in the chronic bioassay. Specifically, the principles recommend that <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> for chronic studies must be based on sound toxicologic principles; <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> should consider human exposure; <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> should be based on a variety of endpoints and effects derived from prechronic studies; and <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> should consider physicochemical and other factors.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the grey value variation at the implant site with different scan settings, including field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, number of projections, exposure time and <b>dose</b> <b>selections</b> in two cone beam CT (CBCT) systems and to compare the results with those obtained from a multislice CT system. Methods: A partially edentulous human mandibular cadaver was scanned by three CT modalities: multislice CT (MSCT) (Philips, Best, the Netherlands), and two CBCT systems: (Accuitomo 170 ®, Morita, Japan) and (NewTom 5 G®, QR, Verona, Italy). Using different scan settings 36 and 24 scans were obtained from the Accuitomo and the NewTom, respectively. The scans were converted to digital imaging and communications in medicine 3 format. The analysis of the data was performed using 3 Diagnosys® software (v. 3. 1, 3 diemme, Cantù, Italy) and Geomagic studio® 2012 (Morrisville, NC). On the MSCT scan, one probe designating the site for pre-operative implant placement was inserted. The inserted probe on MSCT was transformed to the same region on each CBCT scan using a volume-based three-dimensional registration algorithm. The mean voxel grey value of the region around the probe was derived separately for each CBCT. The influence of scanning parameters on the measured mean voxel grey values was assessed. Results: Grey values in both CBCT systems significantly deviated from Hounsfield unit values measured with MSCT (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001). In both CBCT systems, scan FOV and spatial resolution selections had a statistically significant influence on grey value measurements (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001).

The expected net present value (eNPV) has been selected as the primary outcome because it naturally accommodates optimization, providing an explicit trade-off between the probability of success (PoS) and time delays and trial costs. Our findings are that larger studies and/ or implementation of an adaptive design over a fixed design in phase IIb provide more precise <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> and reduce the bias of treatment effects and uncertainty in the estimated eNPV within the range of sample sizes that we examined.

40|$|A {{flexible}} and simple Bayesian decision-theoretic design for dose-finding trials is proposed in this paper. In {{order to reduce}} the computational burden, we adopt a working model with conjugate priors, which is flexible to fit all monotonic dose-toxicity curves and produces analytic posterior distributions. We also discuss how to use a proper utility function to reflect the interest of the trial. Patients are allocated based on not only the utility function but also the chosen <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> rule. The most popular <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> rule is the one-step-look-ahead (OSLA), which selects the best-so-far dose. A more complicated rule, such as the two-step-look-ahead, is theoretically more efficient than the OSLA only when the required distributional assumptions are met, which is, however, often not the case in practice. We carried out extensive simulation studies to evaluate these two <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> rules and found that OSLA was often more efficient than two-step-look-ahead under the proposed Bayesian structure.

40|$|<b>Dose</b> <b>selection</b> is a {{critical}} part of individualising pharmacotherapy in order to ensure optimal safety and effectiveness. Population pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic modelling paired with Bayesian Forecasting is a sophisticated tool that can provide guidance for <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> to clinicians. The overall aim of this thesis was to demonstrate the use of population modelling in three different settings and the utility of this approach for providing individualised <b>dose</b> <b>selection.</b> In the first application the aim was to demonstrate that plasma samples of ribavirin in early Hepatitis C therapy could be used to predict plasma concentrations at Week 4 (critical for toxicity). Bayesian Forecasting was shown to provide a better prediction of ribavirin concentrations than standard linear regression analysis. This work demonstrated that safer and more effective doses could be predicted early in the course of therapy allowing earlier dose individualisation. In the second application the aim was to confirm the published concentration-response relationship of imatinib in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Interestingly, the data showed that patients with higher total plasma concentrations had a poorer response, opposite to what was expected. More work is needed to address this lack of concordance with the previous findings. One suggestion is that since imatinib is highly bound, unbound concentrations may be a better correlate of response than that based on total concentration. In the final application, the aim was to establish a metformin concentration-weight loss relationship in a group of overweight, non-diabetic women. A small but significant relationship between total metformin exposure and weight loss was shown. This finding is novel, as a relationship between drug concentration and weight loss has not been presented in the literature previously. Overall, the work presented in this thesis provided evidence for the value of population modelling and Bayesian Forecasting to assist in dose individualisation. Future directions for this work are: to refine the approach to <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> in these and other important clinical areas of medicine; to establish a strong evidence base for implementation more widely; and then to pursue implementation strategies so that clinicians have access to these tools to make more appropriate <b>dose</b> <b>selection...</b>|$|E

We conducted a first-in-human study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a novel human recombinant alkaline phosphatase (recAP), and we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to support <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> for future patient studies. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trial, healthy volunteers received a single dose of recAP (200, 500, 1000 or 2000 U/kg; n = 33; 3 : 1 ratio) or multiple doses of recAP (500 or 1000 U/kg; n = 18; 2 : 1 ratio) via a 1 -h intravenous infusion on three consecutive days. Serum recAP concentrations, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured, and safety parameters were monitored. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed, and simulations were performed to guide <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> for a phase IIa/b trial. RESULTS: Peak concentrations of recAP and peak AP activity were reached {{at the end of}} the 1 -h infusion and showed a rapid decline, with about 10 % of the maximum concentration remaining at 4 h and less than 5 % remaining 24 h post-start. RecAP treatment was generally well tolerated, and anti-drug antibodies could not be detected in the serum up to 2 weeks post-injection after a single dose, or up to 3 weeks post-injection after multiple doses. A four-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of recAP administration, with moderate inter-individual variability on the central volume of distribution and elimination rate constant. Simulations showed that 1 -h intravenous infusions of 250, 500 and 1000 U/kg recAP once every 24 h for three consecutive days constituted the dosing regimen that best met the criteria for <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> in patient studies.

Problems {{with a large number}} of parameters often require numerical integrations over many dimensions to obtain means. In this dissertation, posterior modes with respect to appropriate measures are used to summarize Bayesian posterior distributions, using the Newton-Raphson method to locate modes. Further inference of modes relies on the normal approximation, using asymptotic multivariate normal distributions to approximate posterior distributions. These techniques are applied to two statistical estimation problems. First, Bayesian sequential <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> procedures are developed for Bioassay problems using Ramsey's prior [28]. Two adaptive designs for Bayesian sequential <b>dose</b> <b>selection</b> and estimation of the potency curve are given.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry now recognises {{the importance of}} the newly defined discipline of pharmacometrics. Pharmacometrics uses mathematical models to describe and then predict the performance of new drugs in clinical development. To ensure these models are useful, the clinical studies need to be designed such that the data generated allows the model predictions to be sufficiently accurate and precise. The capability of the available software to reliably estimate the model parameters must also be well understood.   This thesis investigated two important areas in pharmacometrics: optimal design and software estimation performance. The three optimal design papers progressed significant areas of optimal design research, especially relevant to phase II dose response designs. The use of exposure, rather than dose, was investigated within an optimal design framework. In addition to using both optimal design and clinical trial simulation, this work employed a wide range of metrics for assessing design performance, and was illustrative of how optimal designs for exposure response models may yield <b>dose</b> <b>selections</b> quite different to those based on standard dose response models. The investigation of the optimal designs for Poisson dose response models demonstrated a novel mathematical approach to the necessary matrix calculations for non-linear mixed effects models. Finally, the enormous potential of using optimal adaptive designs over fixed optimal designs was demonstrated. The results showed how the adaptive designs were robust to initial parameter misspecification, with the capability to "learn" the true dose response using the accruing subject data. The two estimation performance papers investigated the relative performance of a number of different algorithms and software programs for two complex pharmacometric models.
