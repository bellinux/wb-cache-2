However, shaping and adapting the titanium plate during surgery is time consuming and technique sensitive especially for a large defect or a disease-deformed mandible. In this case report, a method is introduced to assist surgeons in pre-shaping a reconstruction plate before surgery, and {{with the aid of a}} position guide and <b>drilling</b> <b>guide,</b> the pre-surgically adapted reconstruction plates can be positioned at the planned position during surgery.

40|$|Edentulous {{patients}} {{wearing a}} conventional complete denture often request a fixed restoration for functional, esthetical and/or psychosocial reasons. For these patients implant-supported fixed dental prostheses are a prosthetic means of choice. However, {{after years of}} edentulism often a marked resorption of the alveolar crest has taken place, asking for bone augmentation before implant placement. Thus, fixed implant reconstructions are time and cost intense and stressful for the patient. This case report documents the immediate fixed reconstruction in the edentulous maxilla after ridge augmentation with a cortical cancellous bone graft from the iliac crest and implant placement. A CAD/CAM-system was used for implant planning and the fabrication of a <b>drilling</b> <b>guide.</b> The prosthetic reconstruction was inserted immediately after implant placement...|$|E
30|$|Some authors {{propose a}} direct skin {{incision}} over {{the tip of}} the coracoid, blunt dissection and identification of its base, in order to place the <b>drilling</b> <b>guide</b> [50]. These techniques are performed in a 'blind' manner, and therefore lack the precision that direct visualization may provide. To guarantee a proper view of the lower portion of the base of the coracoid, several arthroscopic techniques that facilitate the process of tunnel-making and implant-positioning have been described [7 – 9]. Glenohumeral access involves the need to release the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments, in order {{to gain access to the}} coracoid process [51]. On the other hand, subacromial access to the coracoid has the advantage over glenohumeral access, as it does not involve the potential deleterious effect that may result from the release of the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments [7].|$|E
40|$|Guided {{surgeries}} {{are becoming}} common in modern dental industry, {{and are used}} {{for a variety of}} treatments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply a dental software toolkit for virtual simulation of dental <b>drill</b> <b>guided</b> surgery. The hypothesis is that if a virtual simulation of dental <b>drill</b> <b>guided</b> surgery can be done, then the preplanned surgery can also be verified before the actual surgery. The dental <b>drill</b> <b>guided</b> concept is a planning and surgical implementation system that enables surgery with the help of a <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> based on planning supported by computer aided design tools and CT-scan. The variation simulation predicts the final positions of the pre-defined critical production dimension at the apical part of the fixture. The results are based on variation simulation of two dental <b>drill</b> <b>guided</b> surgeries: Maxilla, seven implants and Mandible, nine implants. Maxilla resulted in a safe surgery while Mandible needed an optimization of the implant positions before the surgery. By analyzing the results, it was also found that both plans could be optimized in order to minimize the geometrical variation. Finally, it was found that the method used was suitable for predicting guided surgeries to achieve safer treatments...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. During {{drilling}} implant sites, {{mechanical energy}} is converted into thermal one resulting in transient rise in temperature of surrounding bone. The temperature of 47 °C exeeding one minute impairs osseointegration, compromises mechanical {{properties of the}} local bone and could cause early implant failure. This in vitro study aimed to assess the effect of surgical <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> and temperature of irrigans on thermal changes of the local bone during drilling implant sites, and to test the influence of irrigans temperature on the temperature of surgical <b>drill</b> <b>guide.</b> Methods. A total of 48 specimens obtained from bovine ribs were randomly allocated to four experimental conditions according to the 2 x 2 factorial design: <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> (with or without) and saline (at 25 °C or 5 °C). Real-time infrared thermography {{was used as a}} method for temperature measurement. The primary outcome was bone temperature change during drilling implant sites measured at 3 osteotomy depths, whereas the second one was change in the temperature of the <b>drill</b> <b>guide.</b> Data were analyzed by Brunner and Langer nonparametric analysis and Wilcoxon test. Results. The effect of <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> on the changes of bone temperature was significant at the entrance of osteotomy, whereas the effect of saline temperature was significant at all osteotomy levels (p 0. 05). Guided surgery and irrigation with saline at 25 °C were associated with the highest bone temperature increase. Increase in <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> temperature was significantly higher when saline at 25 °C was used (p < 0. 001). Conclusion. Guided implant site preparation generates higher temperature of the local bone than conventional drilling, not exceeding the threshold for thermal bone necrosis. Although saline at room temperature provides sufficient heat control during drilling, cooled saline is more effective regardless the use of surgical <b>drill</b> <b>guide...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Pedicle screw {{placement}} using {{free hand}} technique has {{high incidence of}} pedicle perforation. The said risk can be reduced with intra-operative fluoroscopy or navigation, which have some disadvantages. A promising principle for solving most of the issues is the rapid prototyping technology. By this technique {{it is possible to}} manufacture patient specific <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> templates that enable optimal pedicle screw placement. In the last decade, many studies have featured relatively successful implantations of pedicle screws through the use of <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> templates, though mostly on cadavers. We performed a similar clinical study involving the manufacture of templates for the lumbar and sacral regions that enable simultaneous multiple- level screw implanting. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed in 15 patients. In the lumbar and sacral spine 30 screws were implanted using <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> template and 36 screws using free hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision. Preoperative CT-scans were taken for <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> template design and manufacture using selective laser sintering method. According to postoperative CTscan analysis, pedicle perforation incidence was estimated. Results: The incidence of cortex perforation was significantly reduced in the <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> template group. Conclusions: <b>Drill</b> <b>guide</b> templates {{have turned out to be}} a reliable solution that importantly reduces pedicle perforation incidence and complications related to it. However, there are shortcomings: a relatively lengthy manufacturing process, possible manufacturing faults and incorrect positioning during the operation. Owing to mentioned disadvantages, templates have not replaced free hand and navigation technique yet, but could represent a useful tool in some selected cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{drilling}} and completion of {{safe and effective}} geothermal wells in Hawaii is of vital importance for geothermal operators, drilling contractors, state and county regulators, and the general public. Improper drilling procedures can be costly and dangerous, may {{have a negative impact}} on surface and subsurface environments, cause resource waste, and develop unfavorable public perceptions of geothermal activity. These concerns are powerful incentives to operators and regulators to utilize all possible sources of information on the unique aspects of Hawaiian geothermal drilling. This Hawaii Geothermal <b>Drilling</b> <b>Guide</b> has been prepared as a summary and ready reference for the key concerns and requirements that must be addressed for every geothermal well proposed. This Guide should also encourage an infonned flexibility in geothermal drilling practices, and to supplement State and County regulations, especially those pertaining directly to drilling pennits and operations. This first Guide will be a likely candidate for revision as more drilling experience and information is gathered in the exploration and development of Hawaii's geothermal resources. The proven higher. costs and uncertainties in Hawaiian geothennal drilling operations are sound reasons to make an extraordinary investment in well planning.

40|$|Background: Femur {{fractures}} {{treated with}} the SIGN nail can require additional operative time if the nail is not closely aligned with the <b>drilling</b> <b>guide</b> after insertion. Methods and instruments for compensating for targeting misalignment {{are part of the}} SIGN technique and the aim {{of this study was to}} look at possible trends in deflection which could be used to improve targeting. Methods: Six femoral canal geometries created with C-T scans and modeled in Mimics were supplied by SIGN. This study analyzed the canal shapes recording key landmarks and geometry changes and tested for actual nail deflections in a custom fixture designed to simulate nail insertion with various fractures. Results: Landmarks that contribute to nail deflection were identified both on physical measurements of the Mimics model and verified with testing in the custom fixture. Measurements included overall canal bend, flat section location, middle section trajectory, and canal containment. Conclusions: Several variables were identified which impact deflection and may help predict targeting location and cases that could require additional time to achieve interlocking. Characteristics including fracture location, entry site, canal shape, and nail size play a role in nail deflection. Variations in fracture location and rod size played the largest roles in nail defection. It was observed that the difficulty of nail insertion can be an indicator of nail deflection, but other variables such as nail size and canal shape make the amount of deflection difficult to predict consistently...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried in {{conjunction}} with the Orthodontic department at Halmstad General Hospital in Sweden to investigate the possibility of reducing cost and manufacture time of dental implant <b>drill</b> <b>guides.</b> The current system involves sending a digital image in STL format to the Materialise factory in Belgium where information of the position of dental implants is translated onto a moulded mouthpiece. <b>Drill</b> <b>guides</b> are placed in the mouth piece which is then returned to the surgeon. The mouthpiece complete with <b>drill</b> <b>guides</b> is then placed in the patients mouth and used as a guide for the implant drill holes. The cost of 10000 sek and a turnaround time of 2 weeks gave rise to the need for a faster and cheaper solution. A new mouthpiece was designed comprising of a solid cube which could be clearly seen on the x-ray. Linearisation of the cube faces is used to find a reference point from which to drive a 5 axis drilling platform. The mouthpiece is placed in the drill platform which is driven by stepper motors which in turn are controlled by a microcontroller. Co-ordinates are entered via a PC interface.

Personalised <b>drilling</b> <b>guides</b> may be designed based on surgical planning on CT image data, {{and in this}} study we have evaluated their accuracy. Flexibility was achieved by varying design parameters, so that damaged / abnormal vertebral anatomy was accommodated. The drill-guides were manufactured by rapid-prototyping and then surgery was performed. Surgical outcomes were assessed; results were validated and found to be satisfactory. ...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: Posterior transarticular spine fusion is a surgical procedure used {{to stabilize the}} cervical bodies C 1 and C 2. Currently, spine screws are used most frequently, according to the procedure of Magerl. As the anatomy is rather complex and the view is limited, this procedure has a high risk factor. We present and validate a planning system for cervical screw insertion based on preoperative CT imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The planning system discussed allowed a neurosurgeon to interactively determine the desired position of the cervical screws, based on appropriate and real-time reslices through the preoperative CT image volume. From the planning, a personalized mechanical <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> was derived {{as a means of}} transferring the plan intraoperatively. Eight cadaver experiments were performed to validate this approach. Postoperative CT was applied, and screw locations were extracted from the postoperative images after registering them to preoperative images. In this way, the deviations of the axes of the planned and inserted screws were determined. RESULTS: From an initial cadaver series, it was observed that the <b>drill</b> <b>guides</b> were not stable enough to cope with the drilling forces, and tended to become displaced. Still, most of the inserted screws were reported to be placed adequately. No vascular compromise or invasion of the spinal canal was observed. For a second cadaver series, the design of the <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> was altered. In this series, the displacement was no longer present, and all screws were optimally placed. CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative planning system allowed the neurosurgeon to rehearse screw insertion {{in a way that is}} closer to surgical reality. The image-based validation technique allowed verification and enhancement of the template design on a cadaver study, giving accuracies comparable to those obtained with transfer by navigation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Implants in {{dentistry}} are, besides fixed, removable and maxillofacial prosthodontics, {{one of the}} reliable {{possibility to}} make functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of the edentulism. Surgical and prosthodontic implant complications are often an inattentive consequence of wrong diagnosis, planning, and placement. In this article we present a technique using a highly advanced software program along with a rapid prototyping technology named stereolithography. A planning software for implant placement needs basically the high quality computed tomographic scan of one or both jaws for making accurate preoperative diagnostics and 3 D preoperative plan. Later individual <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> is designed and generated based on both the CT images and the preoperative planning. The patient specific <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> transfers the virtual planning to the patient’s mouth at time of surgery. Conclusions: The advantages of computer guided implantology are the better prepared surgery with visualisation of critical anatomic structures, assessment of available bone and data about bone quality, increased confidence for the surgeon, deceased operative time, less frequent use of bone grafts, higher quality of collaboration between specialists and prosthetic lab and better communication with patients. Radiographic examination of the operation field for computer guided planning for implant placement is due to high costs justified {{as the most important}} information source on the areas to be implanted. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{first three}} {{patients}} received lengthening with the FITBONE nail using an antegrade approach. The PRECICE lengthening nail (second generation) was used twice for lengthening of the humerus of patient G.K. using a retrograde approach. The second PRECICE nail was the technical improved version P 2.1 {{which has no}} ‘thru-slots’ or tack welds {{at the end of}} the proximal nail [10]. To protect the radial nerve from damage during osteotomy, a careful soft-tissue dissection is performed to the bone, and a <b>drill</b> <b>guide</b> and soft-tissue protectors are placed to perform safe drilling and chiseling.|$|R
