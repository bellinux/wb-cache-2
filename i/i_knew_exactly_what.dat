[...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I was going to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up. [...] "I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through." [...] He then transferred to Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, where he went to school with David Furnish. He graduated in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Russell, {{a fan of}} English indie pop band The xx, {{proposed}} the idea of remixing I'm New Here to the band's percussionist and producer Jamie xx. Russell's production on I'm New Here was heavily influenced by the xx's self-titled debut album, which showcased Jamie xx's bassy, beat-oriented and minimalist production. LP - Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx]. Insound. Retrieved on 2011-07-28. After its success, Jamie xx had occupied himself with solo production work, remixing other artists, and DJing in clubs in the United Kingdom and Europe. He was a longtime fan of Scott-Heron's music, which had been introduced {{to him by his}} parents as a youth. Russell later said of his decision to enlist him, [...] "We didn't want lots of remixes by different people. That can be confusing. Gil was open to Jamie re-interpreting the whole album". According to Jamie xx, he himself had no point of reference in remixing another artist's album, and later said of taking on the project, [...] "It was a bit nerve-wracking because {{this is the first time}} I've ever done an album on my own. But I was really just eager to get at and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to do".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{since the}} band {{had not yet}} signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the {{sessions}} entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album – we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive – I mean they signed us, didn't they?" ...|$|E

Runnels investigated, with Deputy Sheriff Z. C. Henslee and {{officers}} Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case {{was placed in a}} paste board box and returned to Chief Runnels's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom and lining had deteriorated enough that pieces fell to the ground as it was placed in the box.

60|$|The {{presents}} my crabbed connection {{spoke of}} so lightly had been supplemented {{only an hour}} before by surely the most magnificent wedding offering from my father-in-law that any man could have--the house in which we were and {{the whole of the}} furniture.

6000|$|After I {{had been}} there a week I began to grow alarmed. I was {{sleeping}} and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life. For a man in my desperate condition that would never do.

60|$|We {{walked for}} rather {{more than a}} mile, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> our {{destination}} was, long before we got there.

However, I cared as little for such folly as the Emperor did, so we crossed the glade and made straight for the old broken trunk.

The {{moment that}} we began to go {{downhill}} I perceived that we were in a position of the greatest danger. The driver was reckless, the boy incompetent, and the horses unmanageable. As my remonstrances and counsels had no effect upon the man, and as you seemed to have no desire to join me in efforts to restrain him to a more prudent rate of speed, I determined to take the affair into my own hands. I knew that the first thing to be done was to rid ourselves of those horses. So long as we were connected with them disaster was imminent. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> ought to be done. The horses must be detached from the coach. I had read, sir, of inventions especially intended to detach runaway horses from a vehicle. To all intents and purposes our horses were runaways, or would have become so in a very short time.

The captain, in {{trying to do the}} same thing, slipped and fell. Seeing this, I sprang up, and, grasping the coil as it flew past, tried to clear it. Before I could think, a turn whipped round my left wrist. I felt a wrench as if my arm had been torn out of the socket, and in a moment I was overboard, [see frontispiece] going down with almost lightning speed into the depths of the sea. Strange to say, I did not lose my presence of mind. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> had happened. I felt myself rushing down, down, down, with terrific speed; a stream of fire seemed to be whizzing past my eyes; there was a dreadful pressure on my brain, and a roaring, as if of thunder, in my ears. Yet, even in that dread moment, thoughts of eternity, of my sins, and of meeting with my God, flashed into my mind, for thought is quicker than the lightning flash.|$|E
60|$|He just begins another question, {{and then}} he catches my eye and stops and goes away to obtain some gloves, and I get a {{breathing}} space. But why do they keep on with this cross-examination? If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I wanted--description, price, size--I should not go to a shop at all, it would save me such {{a lot of trouble}} just to send a cheque to the Stores. The only reason why I go into a tradesman's shop is because I don't know what I want exactly, am in doubt about the name or the size, or the price, or the fashion, and want a specialist to help me. The only reason for having shopmen instead of automatic machines is that one requires help in buying things. When I want gloves, the shopman ought to understand his business sufficiently well to know better than I do what particular kind of gloves I ought to be wearing, and what is a fair price for them. I don't see why I should teach him what is in fashion and what is not. A doctor does not ask you what kind of operation you want and what price you will pay for it. But I really believe these outfitter people would let me run about London wearing white cotton gloves and a plaid comforter without lifting a finger to prevent me.|$|E

Moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him only in one or two very high-class jobs, which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could be proved. So cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the Moriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him.
