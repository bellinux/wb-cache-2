5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, {{who was the first}} to use the term in a publication.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man identity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept in Naruto. He further asserted that it was a term to apply a concrete definition to the ninjas' ability to use jutsu in the series and is comparable to the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role-playing games.|$|E
50|$|David Gilmour of Pink Floyd is {{also known}} for <b>his</b> {{controlled}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibrato bar.|$|R
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{conventional}} diatonic chords, Messiaen often transcended their historically banal connotations (for example, <b>his</b> frequent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> added sixth chord as a resolution).|$|R
50|$|During the season, Cowboys {{teammates}} Terrell Owens and Patrick Crayton criticized him for <b>his</b> continued <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horse-collar tackle.|$|R
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. <b>His</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|The Librarian is {{a highly}} ranked Forerunner {{who is married to}} the Didact. The Librarian spares {{humanity}} from extinction after their war with the Forerunners. She convinces the Forerunner council to use the Halos as preserves for fauna in addition to weapons. She ultimately incapacitates and imprisons the Ur-Didact to stop <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Composer. She is presumed deceased when the Halo Array is fired, but in Primordium 343 Guilty Spark claims she is still alive during the events of the Halo series.|$|E
5|$|The album {{featured}} a cyberpunk-styled narrative {{as well as}} synthesized vocals and industrial influences. Despite the critical and financial failure of the album, Billy Idol set several precedents {{in the process of}} promoting the album. These included <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internet, e-mail, virtual communities, and multimedia software – each a first for a mainstream celebrity. Idol also based his fashion style, music videos, and stage shows on cyberpunk themes and aesthetics.|$|E
500|$|Putnam renounced {{internal}} realism in {{his reply}} to Simon Blackburn {{in the volume}} Reading Putnam. The reasons he gave up his [...] "antirealism" [...] are stated in <b>the</b> first three <b>of</b> his replies in [...] "The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam", an issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journal Philosophical Topics, where he gives a history <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>use(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "internal realism", and, at more length, in his The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body and World (1999).|$|R
2500|$|Snowy White uses a 1957 Les Paul Goldtop {{acquired}} {{in a trade}} for a Fender Stratocaster while in Sweden in 1968. White has been nicknamed [...] "Gold Top" [...] due to <b>his</b> longtime <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model.|$|R
2500|$|George Crabbe ( [...] 24 December 1754 – 3 February 1832) was an English poet, {{surgeon and}} clergyman. He {{is best known}} for <b>his</b> early <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{realistic}} narrative form and his descriptions of middle and working-class life and people.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{authors of}} earlier works {{published}} by Balai Pustaka, Pane {{does not use}} old Malay proverbs; he instead uses similes. Another {{way in which he}} writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch language; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words– representative of the dominant colonial power– to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters. Instead, in Belenggu Pane relies on the Indonesianised loanwords, with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel. Siregar wrote that Pane's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well.|$|E
5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by {{the glory of the}} statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
50|$|He is {{well known}} among Cornell Law School {{students}} for <b>his</b> inquisitive, spirited <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Socratic method in instruction.|$|R
50|$|Gatling {{is known}} for <b>his</b> {{frequent}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headband as an accessory to his NBA uniform. In 2001, he stated that he started the practice {{as a reminder that}} he is lucky to be alive after suffering a serious head injury as a teenager.|$|R
50|$|He professed <b>his</b> <b>use</b> and veneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacraments as <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> union between <b>the</b> {{soul and}} God.|$|R
5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. <b>His</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry III, Richard, the 1st Earl of Cornwall was {{formally}} granted the castle as his main residence in 1231. Richard lived in considerable style, and spent substantial sums on the property, {{building a new}} hall and more luxurious fittings. Richard's election as King of the Romans in 1251 brought an end to <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property, but the castle became embroiled in the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. Simon de Montfort seized the castle after his victory {{at the battle of}} Lewes, using it to imprison the royal family for a time, before moving them to the more secure Kenilworth Castle. Reclaimed by Henry III {{at the end of the}} conflict, it continued to be used by the Earls of Cornwall as a luxurious home for the rest of the century.|$|E

50|$|Ginsburgh's {{style of}} {{teaching}} combines structured thought {{together with a}} freer, associative component that manifests in <b>his</b> generous <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient tradition <b>of</b> gematria (Hebrew numerology), by which he translates between words and numbers. He also implements <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> figurate numbers in interpreting Torah verses.|$|R
40|$|Recalls {{pleasure}} at gaining Smith's acquaintance at Cowes, [Isle of Wight], and sorrow at distance which prevents their meeting. Praises Smith's "English Flora" and <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> language, <b>the</b> 'Umbellate' plants "are surely now perfect". Passes on compliment from Mr P Duncan of New College, Oxford, on Smith's "Flora Britannica"...|$|R
50|$|He {{developed}} a great rivalry with Sir Gordon Richards, and {{later with the}} younger jockey Lester Piggott. He was renowned for his exquisite balance in the saddle, for refusing to race wide, and for <b>his</b> sparing <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whip, preferring to use hands and heels.|$|R
25|$|Many neopagan {{belief systems}} follow Graves in <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{figure of the}} Triple Goddess, and it {{continues}} to be an influence on feminism, literature, Jungian psychology and literary criticism.|$|E
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magical ass' skin in La Peau de chagrin {{for example}} becomes {{a metaphor for}} diminished male potency and a key symbol of Balzac's {{conception}} of energy and will in the modern world.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi {{had sent}} the victim's {{photograph}} from her cellular phone to his own. <b>His</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victim's phone helped speed his arrest because the local cell phone towers logged the messages sent from the phone.|$|E
40|$|I. A. Richards’ {{development}} of feedforward is reviewed. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> feedforward on <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Marshall McLuhan is then surveyed and {{shown to have}} influenced <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> figure/ground, <b>the</b> user as content, <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> a new medium is some older medium, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probe, effects preceding cause, avoidance of {{a point of view}} and roles versus jobs...|$|R
50|$|A Landini cadence (Landini sixth or Landini sixth cadence), or under-third cadence, {{is a type}} of cadence, a {{technique}} in music composition, named after Francesco Landini (1325-1397), a blind Florentine organist, in honor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> extensive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technique. The technique was used extensively in the 14th and early 15th century.|$|R
50|$|He soon {{returned}} to England, {{where he lived}} for eight years in close connection with Giuseppe Mazzini, by whom, with some misgiving, he was persuaded to join the Revolutionary Committee. Quarrels of a kind only too common among exiles followed. Hungarians were especially offended by <b>his</b> continuing <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> Regent.|$|R
25|$|Despite his influence, however, Mazzoni {{has been}} subject to some criticism. Some see, for example, a contradiction in trying to assign both {{pleasure}} and social utility to poetry at the same time, while others question <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distinction between icastic and phantastic mimesis (Leitch, 301).|$|E
25|$|The Dhuni (a {{word that}} {{literally}} means “fire”) is a fire ritual that Meher Baba co-opted from other religious traditions {{and made his}} own. Thus <b>his</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word and modification of its practice is not precisely analogous to its traditional form as found in Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|Gudea {{built more}} than the House of Ningirsu, he {{restored}} tradition to Lagaš. <b>His</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title ensi, when he obviously held enough political influence, both in Lagaš and in the region, to justify lugal, demonstrates the same political tact as his emphasis {{on the power of}} the divine.|$|E

50|$|His {{most recent}} work, 20.July 2015 (2016), traces <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> several socialist realist sculptures from the Green Bridge in central Vilnius, {{that had been}} erected in 1952.
