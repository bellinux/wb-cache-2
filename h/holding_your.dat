500|$|Blow {{acknowledged}} that The Witness was an intellectually difficult game, intentionally not developed for a mass audience. He considers his approach [...] "anti-Nintendo", providing few to no additional {{instructions to the}} player in contrast with typical Nintendo games. In contrast to most games developed at the time, of which Blow believed [...] "treat [...] as the lowest common denominator", he wanted the audience for The Witness {{to be for the}} player that [...] "is inquisitive and likes to be treated as an intelligent person". He compared the approach he took with The Witness to that of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, as the novel [...] "isn’t <b>holding</b> <b>your</b> hand the whole way through to make sure you understood every paragraph", and believed he could do the same within a video game. The game's timed challenge featuring randomly generated puzzles was purposely designed to be difficult, according to Blow, intended to be [...] "about testing how deeply a player has internalized the rules to the puzzles and how quickly they can react to new configurations".|$|E
500|$|Manhunt {{is easily}} the most violent game ever made. It will likely be {{dismissed}} by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But Manhunt also is the Clockwork Orange of video games, <b>holding</b> <b>your</b> eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had Manhunt been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. Manhunt is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep {{through the streets of}} this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's Ubisoft's Splinter Cell meets the cult Faces of Death videos [...] If Manhunt succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate. That makes Manhunt the most important video game of the last five years.|$|E

[...] About.com critic Bill Lamb considered it a [...] "simplistic song derivative of Justin Timberlake", and stated that the lyrics does not have [...] "substance to expand into an entire song." [...] HitFix blogger Chris Eggertsen thought that [...] "Boyfriend" [...] is lyrically the same song Bieber has sung since his career first started, but noted that none of his fans would notice such aspect. Gregory Hicks of The Michigan Daily commented that Bieber is copying Timberlake's R style on the song, and {{described the}} lyrics as original [...] "in the sense that few artists are willing to introduce this much poetic stupidity into their music.". RedEyes Ernest Wilkins said that Bieber doesn't know how to rap well, adding that [...] "I yearn for {{the days of the}} Wahlberg men being the most awkward white male rappers on Earth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And <b>holding</b> <b>your</b> arm out like that can get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
