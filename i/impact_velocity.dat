5|$|The {{estimated}} probability of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit. However, {{given that the}} comet nucleus is around 60km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable <b>impact</b> <b>velocity</b> of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a nondimensional {{formulation}} of an analytical model {{was used to}} study the ballistic behaviour of composite plates made from woven laminates of E-glass fibres. From this model the influence of two nondimensional ratios (the geometry and density ratios) on the ballistic limit, contact time, and energy-absorption mechanisms were analysed at different <b>impact</b> <b>velocities.</b> The increase of both ratios raises the ballistic limit and varies the contact time between the projectile and plate. At <b>impact</b> <b>velocities</b> that do not cause perforation, the contact time decreases while at <b>impact</b> <b>velocities</b> over the ballistic limit, this time increases. Regardless of the ratio, the main energy-absorption mechanism is the fibre-failure at velocities below the ballistic limit, and the cone movement, for <b>impact</b> <b>velocities</b> over the ballistic limit. At the ballistic limit the main mechanisms are fibre failure and fibre elastic deformation.

Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the normal force can act ahead or behind the centre of mass of the ball, and friction from the ground {{will depend on the}} alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and <b>impact</b> <b>velocity.</b> Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} EM guns revolve around the assumption that greater muzzle velocity is always better, this is open to challenge. Parametric relationships between range, payload weight, and launch velocity show {{that this is not a}} strong argument for many suggested EM gun applications.

In addition, explosive fragmentary warhead lethality is largely unaffected by velocity and does not require more demanding hit-to-kill guidance electronics that may not survive extremely high gun launch accelerations. [...] Significantly, explosively formed penetrator and shaped charge warheads already drive what is technically a kinetic energy penetrator to velocities well in excess of EM gun launch capabilities, up to 8 km/s for a shaped charge, upon detonation with the target; and it has been demonstrated that with respect to armor penetration, increased <b>impact</b> <b>velocity</b> much above 2 km/s does not necessarily result in a deeper hole; (although the crater may be wider as more energy is deposited with increased <b>impact</b> <b>velocity).</b>|$|E
