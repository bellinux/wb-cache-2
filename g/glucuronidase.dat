40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a screening method to discover efficient hemicellulase producers {{in a wide range of}} fungi. The method is based on the potential of soil fungi to degrade soluble and insoluble xylan-rich substrates, by assigning various individual enzyme activities. Released mono- and oligosaccharides were monitored by high performance anion exchange chromatography and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In addition, the released amounts of acetic acid were measured. Fungal strains, grown on wheat straw, with an efficient production of hemicellulolytic enzymes were Aspergillus lentulus, Penicllium pinophilum, and Trichoderma harzianum. Next, two glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 endo-xylanases and two GH 11 endo-xylanases of Myceliophthora thermophila C 1 (C 1) were subjected to a detailed characterisation. The degradation products from xylan-rich substrates, varying in type and degree of substituents, displayed that both intra- and interfamily differences occurred for these endo-xylanases. The different degradation profiles were correlated with a difference in the predicted secondary protein structure of the GH 10 xylanases and with a minor difference in the primary protein structure of the GH 11 xylanases. An additional cellulose binding domain attached to the endo-xylanases did not enhance the degradation of insoluble substrates. In addition, synergy studies were performed on acetyl (xylan) esterases with <b>glucuronidases.</b> A concerted action of acetyl (xylan) esterases from different carbohydrate esterase families as well as synergy with <b>glucuronidases</b> of different GH families was observed...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1994, Jefferson first {{articulated}} the Hologenome Theory of Evolution, at a presentation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, at a Symposium [...] "A Decade of PCR" [...] This theory was developed from his molecular and genetic work on glucuronide metabolism by vertebrate-associated microbes, including {{the role of}} <b>glucuronidases,</b> sulfatases and other enzymes in modulating and effecting enterohepatic circulation of steroid hormones. The levels, ratios and timing of steroid hormone de-conjugation (activation) and resorption modulates virtually all aspects of vertebrate ontogeny, physiology and reproduction. The premise for his theory was that natural selection acts on the holobiont comprising a 'scaffold genome' and myriad microbial constituents in diverse ecosystems, selecting for persistence of the set of genetically-encoded capabilities.|$|R
40|$|Blood {{tests are}} necessary, easy-to-perform and {{low-cost}} alternatives for monitoring of oncolytic virotherapy and other biological therapies in translational research. Here we assessed three candidate proteins {{with the potential}} to be used as biomarkers in biological fluids: two <b>glucuronidases</b> from E. coli (GusA) and Staphylococcus sp. RLH 1 (GusPlus), and the luciferase from Gaussia princeps (GLuc). The three genes encoding these proteins were inserted individually into vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 68 genome under the control of an identical promoter. The three resulting recombinant viruses were used to infect tumor cells in cultures and human tumor xenografts in nude mice. In contrast to the actively secreted GLuc, the cytoplasmic <b>glucuronidases</b> GusA and GusPlus were released into the supernatants only as a result of virus-mediated oncolysis. GusPlus resulted in the most sensitive detection of enzyme activity under controlled assay conditions in samples containing as little as 1 pg/ml of GusPlus, followed by GusA (25 pg/ml) and GLuc (≥ 375 pg/ml). Unexpectedly, even though GusA had a lower specific activity compared to GusPlus, the substrate conversion in the serum of tumor-bearing mice injected with the GusA-encoding virus strains was substantially higher than that of GusPlus. This was attributed to a 3. 2 fold and 16. 2 fold longer half-life of GusA in the blood stream compared to GusPlus and GLuc respectively, thus a more sensitive monitor of virus replication than the other two enzymes. Due to the good correlation between enzymatic activity of expressed marker gene and virus titer, we conclude that the amount of the biomarker protein in the body fluid semiquantitatively represents the amount of virus in the infected tumors which was confirmed by low light imaging. We found GusA to be the most reliable biomarker for monitoring oncolytic virotherapy among the three tested markers...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{degradation of}} complex xylans needs collaboration of many xylan degrading enzymes. Assays for xylan degrading activities based on reducing sugars or PNP substrates are not indicative {{for the presence}} of enzymes able to degrade complex xylans: They do not provide insight into the possible presence of xylanase-accessory enzymes within enzyme mixtures. A new screening method is described, by which specific xylan modifying enzymes can be detected. Fermentation supernatants of 78 different fungal soil isolates grown on wheat straw were analyzed by HPLC and MS. This strategy is powerful in recognizing xylanases, arabinoxylan hydrolases, acetyl xylan esterases and <b>glucuronidases.</b> No fungus produced all enzymes necessary to totally degrade the substrates tested.

The ability to alter and modulate, amplify and suppress, disseminate and recruit new capabilities as microbially-encoded 'traits' means that sampling, sensing and responding to the environment become intrinsic features and emergent capabilities of the holobiont, with mechanisms that can provide rapid, sensitive, nuanced and persistent performance changes. [...] Studies by Froebe et al. in 1990 indicating that essential mating pheromones, including androstenols, required activation by skin-associated microbial <b>glucuronidases</b> and sulfatases. In the absence of microbial populations in the skin, no detectable aromatic pheromone was released, as the pro-pheromone remained water-soluble and non-volatile. This effectively meant that the microbes in the skin were essential to produce a mating signal.|$|R

We observed that during the routine procedure for cell disruption (ultrasound, 100 kHz, 5 min) some of the chondroitinase B activity was lost. Using milder conditions (2 min), most of the chondroitinase B and AC protein was solubilized and the enzyme activities were preserved. Tryptic soy broth without glucose was the best culture medium both for bacterial growth and enzyme induction.

The bioavailability of statins is affected by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 and <b>glucuronidases</b> metabolism as well as uptake and efflux transporters that affect drug disposition. CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 variants have been demonstrated to influence the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of statins. Inducers and inhibitors of CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 {{play an important role}} in reducing statin efficacy and increase the risk of adverse effects, respectively. Statins have been demonstrated to increase CYP 3 A expression in vitro, most likely because they are ligands to nuclear receptors (pregnane X receptor and constitutive androsterone receptor) that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and bind to responsive elements in the CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 3 A 5 promoter regions.

30|$|The {{production}} {{of two different}} interesting oligosaccharides was possible with both commercial (xylobiose, pentasaccharide 1) and thermophilic microorganisms (tetrasaccharide 2) from this hemicellulose fraction. 1 H- 13 C NMR correlations of products were studied for precise structural assignment. Significant amounts of low molecular mass compounds, xylobiose and trace amounts of xylose were liberated from birch wood xylan after 24  h (Lin et al. [1999]) using Thermomyces lanuginosus enzyme; however cellulase activity could contaminate this endo-β-(1 [*]→[*] 4)-xylanase preparation (Subramaniyan and Prema [2002]) explaining the results obtained. Xylanase from Thermotoga maritima is an extremely thermostable enzyme which hydrolyzed xylo-oligosaccharides and xylans to yield predominantly xylobiose as end product (Jiang et al. [2004]). Xylobiose and small xylooligomers as main products in high amount from Arundo biomass confirmed this activity. The absence of glucose {{can be explained by}} better purity of enzymatic preparation (xylanase) with respect to T. lanuginosus reaction. As far as T. neapolitana CFE-TN and T. thermostercoris CFE-TT were concerned, presence of xylanases, xylosidases, <b>glucuronidases</b> and arabinofuranosidases were confirmed in the crude extracts by the action on suitable chromophoric and polysaccharidic substrates (data not shown). The results on Arundo indicated also that action of β-glucosidases is dependent on enzymatic load in the reaction mixture, and this phenomenon could be analyzed with respect to the known interrelation of cellulases and xylanases in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic material (Hu et al. [2011]). All these data are of great interest in the view of research for biocatalyst suitable for complete saccharification of the cellulose and hemicellulose components in raw material to fermentable sugars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bee honey is a {{functional}} food {{which has a}} unique composition, antimicrobial properties and bifidogenic effect. In order to assess whether honey can inhibit the toxic effect of mycotoxins, {{the present study was}} undertaken. Methods Production of biomass and toxins by Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus ochraceus were followed in media without and with honey. Although aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. were administrated to male Swiss albino mice up to 1 μg and 10 ng/kg body weight/day respectively. The experimental animals were fed diets without our with 10 % honey for two months. The changes in colonic probiotic bacteria, determintal colon enzyme <b>glucuronidases,</b> and genotoxicity were followed. Results Addition of 32 % in its media increased the biomass of A parasiticus, while the biomass of A. ochraceus decreased and Ochratoxin A. was not produced. When the honey was added at the ratio of 32 and 48 % in the medium. No relationship was found between mycelium weight and production of mycotoxins. Oral administration of aflatoxins (mixture of B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) and Ochratoxin A. induced structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow and germ cells of male mice, whereas, honey treatment reduced the genotoxicity of mycotoxins. Also both toxins induced histopathological changes in liver and kidney. Feeding on diet supplemented with honey improved the histopathological changes in case of aflatoxin group, but not in the case of ochratoxin A. group (except of kidney in two cases). No significant differences were found in the activity of colon β-glucuronidase between group fed diet with or without honey. On the other hand, the colon bifido bacteria and lactobacilli counts were increased markedly in group receiving diet supplemented with honey. Conclusion Substituting sugars with honey in processed food can inhibit the harmful and genotoxic effects of mycotoxins, and improve the gut microflora. </p...|$|R
50|$|This gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, {{an enzyme}} of the glucuronidation pathway that {{transforms}} small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites.

Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes.

However, one trial involving 183 patients published in the British Medical Journal showed no overall effect. Dr Len McEwen, inventor of EPD, speculated that the reason for the failure might have been that the beta <b>glucuronidase</b> enzyme preparation was inadvertently heated or frozen during storage in the hospital pharmacy, as it is sensitive to the storage temperature and enzyme from the same manufactured batch had been used to treat a number of patients successfully.

40|$|The glucuronide {{metabolites}} {{are important}} both for toxicology and for pharmacokinetics of many drugs and xenobiotics. Even though glucuronides oftenlack the pharmacological activity, after de-conjugation, the free aglycone can regain that activity and may present an environmental burden. Furthermore, glucuronides {{may be used}} as markers of the past substance exposure, like for example the ethyl-glucuronide in body hair for alcohol abuse or the cannabinoid-glucuronides for cannabis abuse. Therefore, quantification of glucuronide metabolites in biological matrices may be very important. However, due to their highly hydrophilic nature, the separation of glucuronides from the matrix (body fluids, hair, and environmental samples) may be difficult. For that purpose, many sample preparation techniques can be used, including the liquid extraction, solid phase extraction, dried blood spots, protein precipitation, direct injection, on-line solid phase extraction and others. Furthermore, some glucuronides, such as acyl- and N-glucuronides can be highly unstable. Glucuronides can be measured either by a direct or an indirect approach. With the latter, the glucuronides are cleaved back to their parent aglycone by enzymes known as the ŽŽ- <b>glucuronidases,</b> afterwards the freed aglycone is quantified according to its calibration curve. With direct measurement, unchanged glucuronides are quantified by their MRMs, where some significant benefits can be expected, namely, quicker sample preparation, better accuracy and precision, and selectivity towards glucuronide isomers. Tandem mass spectrometry is the corner stone for direct glucuronide quantification because it offers both exceptional selectivity and sensitivity. However, this approach requires the use of authentic glucuronide standards. This necessity can be avoided with thesemi-quantitative approach, where the response factor for glucuronide is used to quantify it against the calibration curve for the parent. The recent advancement of mass spectrometersŽʼ speed and sensitivity coupled with higher mass accuracy promises an even easier measurement of glucuronides in complex biological matrices, allowing a faster method development, robust response, and quicker sample preparation. Notwithstanding the described improvements, the glucuronide identification and quantification in difficult matrices will still remain a challenge for the analyst...|$|R
