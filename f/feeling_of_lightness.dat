25|$|Although {{constructed}} with different systems, {{all of the}} buildings on the site give a common image and appear as a unified whole. The architects achieved this {{by the use of}} some common elements in all the buildings. The first one is the use of floor-to-ceiling glass windows on steel frames that go around the corners of the buildings without a visible (most of the time without any) structural support. The other unifying element is the use of brick. All buildings have a base of about 40cm of black brick and the rest is built of yellow bricks. The combined effect is a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightness</b> or as Gropius called it “etherealization”.|$|E

60|$|When {{he started}} that {{morning for the}} Temple, he had still a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> {{extraordinary}} <b>lightness</b> in his limbs, and he still saw that face--its perfect regularity, its warm pallor, and dark smiling eyes rather wide apart, its fine, small, close-set ears, and the sweep of the black-brown hair across the low brow. Or was it something much less definite he saw--an emanation or expression, a trick, a turn, an indwelling grace, a something that appealed, that turned, and touched him? Whatever it was, it would not let him be, {{and he did not}} desire that it should. For this was in his character; if he saw a horse that he liked, he put his money on whatever it ran; if charmed by an opera, he went over and over again; if by a poem, he almost learned it by heart. And while he walked along the river--his usual route--he had queer and unaccustomed sensations, now melting, now pugnacious. And he felt happy.|$|R

60|$|Next morning Martin Rattler awoke with a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightness</b> in his head, and a {{sensation}} of extreme weakness pervading his entire frame. Turning his head round {{to the right}} he observed that a third hammock was slung across the further end of the hut; which was, no doubt, that in which the hermit had passed the night. But it was empty now. Martin did not require to turn {{his head to the}} other side to see if Barney O'Flannagan was there, for that worthy individual made his presence known, for a distance of at least sixty yards all round the outside of the hut, by means of his nose, which he was in the habit of using as a trumpet when asleep. It was as well that Martin did not require to look round; for he found, to his surprise, that he had scarcely strength to do so. While he was wondering in a dreamy sort of manner what could be the matter with him, the hermit entered the hut bearing a small deer upon his shoulders. Resting his gun {{in a corner of the}} room, he advanced to Martin's hammock.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{the music}} was played by a small band {{with one or two}} melodic {{instruments}} and a drum.

In 1928, ballet came to Iran and impacted dance performance, adding a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightness</b> and more delicate footwork.

50|$|The instrument's {{harpsichord}} pedigree {{is evident}} in the shallow 1/4 in key dip one is used to in the harpsichord action instead of the modern piano's 3/8 in. It has a lightness of tone from the narrow-gauge stringing and the duration of string vibration decreases gradually as you progress up the keyboard so that the treble section notes fade quickly, not having the longevity we expect from later pianos. The Backers escapement gives the keys a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightness</b> and the action a responsiveness that allows for very rapid playing.|$|E

Benscheidt considered that {{the point of view of}} the passengers on the trains was the one that determined the image of the building and placed great weight on the facade on that side. It was already noted by Peter Behrens (with whom Gropius and Meyer were working one year before starting work on the Fagus factory) that architects should take account of the way the speed of modern transportation affects the way architecture is perceived. Gropius had also commented the subject in his writings. According to the historian of architecture Annemarie Jaeggi these thoughts were important in the design of Fagus:“The animated fluctuation in height, the change between horizontal structure and vertical rhythms, heavy closed volumes and light dissolved fabrics, are indicators of an approach that deliberately utilized contrasts while arriving at a harmony of opposites in a manner best expressed as a pictorial or visual structure created from the perspective of the railroad tracks.” ...|$|E
