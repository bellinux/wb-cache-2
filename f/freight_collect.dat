30|$|Allen, et al. [3] {{presented}} a complete revision of 162 studies of urban <b>freight</b> that <b>collected</b> urban <b>freight</b> {{data from the}} 1960 ’s to 2008 in 18 countries. Only 28 studies {{were made in the}} period 1960 – 1989. The rest (134) were made from 1990 to 2008 showing an increment of the practice in recent years, especially in Europe. This {{increase in the number of}} freight studies could be due to new techniques in collecting data and interest of the public sector in the freight movements. However, it is important to note that many freight data collection efforts are not published in journals or in English. Most of them are reports written in the language of the region/country that sometimes are not disseminated or simply archived.|$|R
25|$|Most {{interurban}} {{cars and}} <b>freight</b> locomotives <b>collected</b> current from an overhead trolley wire. The cars contacted this wire {{through the use}} of a trolley pole or a pantograph. Others designs collected current from a third rail. Some interurbans used both: in open country, the third rail was used and in town, a trolley pole was raised. An example of this was the Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad where a trolley pole was used in both Aurora and Elgin, Illinois. Third rail was cheaper to maintain and more conductive, but it was more expensive to construct initially and it did not eliminate the need for AC transformers, AC transmission lines, and AC/DC conversion systems. In addition, third rail posed a serious danger to trespassers and animals and was difficult to keep clear of ice.|$|R
30|$|Considering that 1) {{there is}} a {{profound}} lack {{of information about the}} amount of freight, freight trips and service trips in urban areas; and 2) this lack of information prevents that planners and transportation engineers realize about the magnitude of the problem and find adequate solutions to freight issues; this study provides a good start of how can we shed light on decision makers to continue planning the cities, but now considering the movement of goods in a more reliable fashion. Thus, this paper contributes to this gap in the in the quantification of the problem based on a freight study and its findings. As an example of this, and based on the <b>freight</b> data <b>collected</b> in this study and its results, the local government decided to start using the freight information to analyze projects, programs and policies to improve freight transportation system in the Medellin metropolitan area. Although it took almost 5  years after this first study ended, in 2017 the Medellin Department of Transportation and the Area Metropolitana del Valle de Aburra (leader public institution that is the emission/transportation authority in the area) decided to expand this study in three scopes: 1) Update the freight OD matrix; 2) Characterize the freight movements with complementary studies (e.g., large traffic generators, service trips), and 3) Propose freight policies to improve freight transportation system in the Medellin metropolitan area. The project is currently underway and it is a proof that starting to <b>collect</b> <b>freight</b> data and analyzing it could lead the public sector to increase the interest in freight planning that obviously will help the development of urban areas, where freight is and will be a constant.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Freight {{transportation}} {{data was}} indispensable input to transportation planning. In Thailand, efforts {{had been put}} to <b>collect</b> <b>freight</b> movement data by conducting road side survey and commodity flow survey. The result of these surveys did not produce consistent volume of shipment due to limited sampling coverage and non-response. Nevertheless, freight distribution patterns, which were derived from these surveys, were favorably consistent with each other. Approach: The objective {{of this study was}} propose an approach to improving quality of the commodity flow survey data in terms of total shipment weight. Our scope of study is limited to consumer goods and food stuffs. Multiple imputation was performed to correct non-response. The shipment weight was again adjusted by taking into account of the probability of no shipment in a particular quarter. Results: Comparison between the adjusted weight and road side survey data showed that the discrepancies in total weight of significantly reduced. Conclusion: Total shipment weights of the CFS after the adjustments were compared to those of road side survey. Plausible result was obtained for the case of consumer goods, while that of food stuffs was still notably different...|$|R
40|$|This paper conducts an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} temporal stability of parameters of freight demand models in the short-medium term using seven national <b>freight</b> origin-destination samples <b>collected</b> in Colombia during the years 1999 to 2005. The paper considers freight generation, freight distribution, and empty trip models. To identify time-dependent effects, models were estimated using a panel formulation with time-dependent parameters and fixed time effects, and compared with the corresponding cross-sectional models. The results indicate the presence of statistically significant time-dependent effects on all freight generation models (production and attraction), freight distribution models (both based on loaded vehicle trips and commodity flows), and empty trips models. The literature review conducted indicates that this article is, if not the first, {{one of the few}} publications studying the temporal stability of parameters. The results show a remarkably consistent pattern in that the components of freight demand that could change faster (i. e., freight production and attraction) are the ones that exhibit the largest rates of parameter change. As shown, the rates of change for these models are 18. 29 % and 26. 37 % respectively. In contrast, the freight distribution models of loaded trips were found to change less rapidly (10. 50 % and 1. 94 % depending on the impedance function); while the tonnage distribution model only exhibited fixe...|$|R
40|$|Major {{roads in}} Yemen are not paved and its {{population}} density {{is high in}} coastal areas, implementing the idea of intermodal transportation method all over the coastline will give the product industries a huge advantages, due to its attractive solutions to the poor transportation infrastructure and its extremely limited road transportation system. The transport of goods in Yemen depends heavily on road transport {{in the absence of}} rail transport and limited movement by air transport and its high cost, the private sector provides the bulk of land transport services (goods) and has accompanied the performance of road transport activities in the absence of regulation and supervision. In this research paper the author intends to analyse and develop optimal intermodal freight transportation plans for product shipping in Yemen by using two modes of transport (truck, ship) without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes. Using intermodal transportation is vital for the product movement and supplies when single mode alternative becomes unusable or infeasible. The author intends to use quantitative research method, plan and execute fieldwork, <b>collecting</b> data form <b>freight</b> companies (truck, ship), local factories, Ministry of Transportation, etc. Compile preliminary maps of roads condition and population density. First the author intends to visit the Ministry of Transport to closely monitor the program and objectives of the Ministry and the secret of work and projects in which it is implemented and meet with its representative for the purpose of collecting data and evidence of the difficulties it faces in order to become familiar with it Comprehensively and directly on its problems and study the possible solutions., the author will intend to visit Aden and Hodeida ports to view the service and facilities for {{a better understanding of the}} processes and to examine the availabilities of intermodal transportation <b>freight</b> and <b>collect</b> data of sea freight costs. The author also intends to visit a local factory (Shamlan Industry Ltd) to explore difficulties of products movement on road, costs, etc. the author attempts to provide an in depth examination of two major tasks, single mode and multimodal. Finally the Author intends to visit Ministry of public works and roads to compile preliminary maps of roads condition and population density. As a result Intermodal transportation can be a solution when transportation resources are scarce, bad road infrastructure and mountainous terrain. The quantity of demand is usually high and required an instant solution to meet the demand of the transportation resources. After analysing data and identifying findings of two modes of transportation, the author found multimodal fright transportation cost is comparatively advantage over single transportation mode...|$|R
