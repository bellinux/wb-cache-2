The managerial team acted trying to get a financial advantage of the operations carried out. Five years later one can draw up a complete balance of the outcomes. They are disastrous for Bulgaria. Not a single hypothesis of the managerial team has been confirmed. The projections were carried out unprofessionally and incompetently. On the other hand, however, the counterparts (investors) could not have lost. In the end, the country has paid about one billion EUR more to service its external debt. ...|$|R
