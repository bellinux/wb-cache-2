30|$|The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> (DE) of {{the dried}} pectin was 60.4 %. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> is an {{important}} molecular index for pectin classification that describes {{the extent to which}} carboxyl groups in pectin molecules exist as the methyl ester. The pectin obtained can be categorized as high methoxyl pectin (HMP) because it has a high percentage of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> greater than 50 %. A high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> allows pectin to form gel quickly at high temperatures, having a more effective action on the lipid profile (Brouns et al. 2012; Dominiak et al. 2014). However, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> represents only the ratio between methanol-esterified carboxyl groups and free carboxyl groups, whereas the methoxyl rate refers to the amount of methoxyl groups in a sample (Gnanasambandam and Proctor 1999). Therefore, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> should not be assessed separately, as it does not represent the actual amount of methyl esterifications, especially when the galacturonic acid content is low. High methoxyl pectins (HMP) (with DE[*]>[*] 50 %) require a relatively high concentration of soluble solids and a low pH for gel formation, while low methoxyl pectins (LMP) (with DE[*]<[*] 50 %) form rigid gels by the action of calcium or multivalent cations, which cross-link the galacturonic acid chains (Garna et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} that enabled {{the study of}} non-esterified galacturonic acid sequences (so-called blocks) in pectin. Endopolygalacturonase of Kluyveromyces fragilis was used to extensively degrade pectin, and {{the composition of the}} galacturonic acid molecules produced was determined with high-performance anion-exchange chromatography at pH 5. With this technique, the amount of non-esterified mono-, di-, and trigalacturonic acid released was determined. In addition, the relative amounts of methyl-esterified oligomers — up to 10 galacturonic acid residues — could be observed. By comparing the percentages of non-esterified mono-, di-, and trigalacturonic acids released, pectins with large enzyme-degradable blocks could be distinguished from pectins with small enzyme-degradable blocks. High percentages of mono- and digalacturonic acid were found for pectins containing small non-esterified blocks. The total area of all peaks corresponding to methyl-esterified oligomers was found to be indicative for the distribution of these blocks. The higher the ratio of the methyl- to non-esterified peak areas, the more closely associated blocks are present.

40|$|Sugar {{beet pulp}} is an {{important}} by-product of the sugar industry. In {{order to make the}} most of this waste, pectin extraction can constitute an economical solution. Pectin is commonly used in food industry as a gelling agent. However, in the present study another use of pectin is considered: its potential embedding into biodegradable polymer films which can further be used in plastic industry. At first, different pectin extraction methods have been developed on sugar beet pulp in order to obtain four different types of pectins characterized at the same time by their molecular weight <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification.</b> Acidic extraction leads to pectin of high molecular weight and high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification.</b> From this pectin, a de-esterification and a de-polymerization allow us to obtain, respectively, a pectin of high molecular weight and low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> and a pectin of low molecular weight and high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification.</b> On the other hand, a basic extraction leads to pectin of low molecular weight and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification.</b> Preliminary, tests have been conducted on mixes comprising 5, 10, 15, 20 % of commercial pectin and PLA (polylactic acid) or PBAT (Polybutylen-adipate terephtalate). In all cases, the products were not stable and therefore the use of a compatibilizing agent was required. Glycerol and D-Sorbitol were thus studied for that purpose, in mixing ratios between 40 - 80 % with commercial pectin. The best mechanical properties (Young modulus; yield stress and yield strain) were obtained with the pectin/sorbitol 50 / 50 mix. This proportion was then used with our different sugar beet pulp extracted pectins to produce PLA/pectin/Sorbitol 50 / 25 / 25 formulations. The best mechanical properties were reached with the low molecular weight end <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> pectin. Indeed, the relative small size of this pectin with the lack of esterified groups enables interactions between pectin chains plastified by sorbitol and PLA.

The distribution difference of pectin epitopes was also present in procambium–cambium derivatives. The arabinan existed in all cell walls of primary xylem, but was absent from the tangential walls of secondary xylem cells. The galactan existed only in mature primary phloem. Furthermore, 19 pectin methylesterases (PMEs) genes were identified by RNA sequencing, six genes presented highly differentially and were supposed to be involved in the cell wall esterification process.

Biosynthesis was induced by addition of pectic substances to cultures growing on glucose or cellulose but not cellobiose; the disaccharide repressed enzyme synthesis and triggered inactivation of enzyme previously secreted. The PL, purified to electrophoretic and serologic homogeneity, had a molecular size of 56 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point at pH 4. 16. The amino acid composition closely resembled {{that of the}} major extracellular endoglucanases of the actinomycete. The enzyme had six cystine residues but no detectable sulfhydryl groups. It was inactivated by mild reducing agents and activated by oxygenation, indicating the necessity for disulfide bond maintenance. Temperature and pH optima for the PL reaction were 60 degrees C and 10. 45, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} effect of 2 {{formulation}} variables, the pectin type (with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> [DEs]) and the amount of calcium, on drug release from pectin-based matrix tablets. Pectin matrix tablets were prepared by blending indomethacin (a model drug), pectin powder, and various amounts of calcium acetate and then tableting by automatic hydraulic press machine. Differential scanning calorimetry, powder x-ray diffraction, and Fourier transformed-infrared spectroscopy studies of the compressed tablets revealed no drug-polymer interaction and the existence of drug with low crystallinity. The in-vitro release studies in phosphate buffer (United States Pharmacopeia) and tris buffer indicated that the lower the DE, the greater the time for 50 % of drug release (T 50). This finding is probably because of the increased binding capacity of pectin to calcium. However, when the calcium was excluded, the pectins with different DEs showed similar release pattern with insignificant difference of T 50. When the amount of calcium acetate was increased from 0 to 12 mg/tablet, the drug release was significantly slower. However, a large amount of added calcium (ie, 24 mg/tablet) produced greater drug release because of the partial disintegration of tablets. The results were more pronounced in phosphate buffer, where the phosphate ions induced the precipitation of calcium phosphate. In conclusion, both pectin type and added calcium affect the drug release from the pectin-based matrix tablets...|$|R

Butternut pectin had a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> methyl <b>esterification.</b> In the presence of high concentrations of sugar and at low pH, this pectin did not form gels but instead produced viscous solutions.

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} and antimicrobial {{properties of}} cocoa pod husk (CPH) pectin {{intended as a}} versatile pharmaceutical excipient and nutraceutical were studied. Properties investigated include pH, moisture content, ash values, swelling index, viscosity, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> (DE), flow properties, SEM, FTIR, NMR, and elemental content. Antimicrobial screening and determination of MICs against test microorganisms were undertaken using agar diffusion and broth dilution methods, respectively. CPH pectin had a DE of 26. 8...|$|E
40|$|Citrus pectin {{with a low}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> methyl <b>esterification</b> (LMP) and its deesterified form, {{potassium}} pectate (KP), were modified with a low {{amount of}} UV-absorbing substituents. For this purpose, two different substitution reactions were used (a) alkylation of hydroxyl groups with p-carboxybenzyl bromide in aqueous alkali and (b) alkylation of the carboxylate group with benzyl bromide in the DMSO/TBAI/catalyst system. Chemical and spectroscopic methods reveal a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> substitution (DS< 0. 1) for the derivatives. The hydrodynamic properties were assessed by analytical ultracentrifugion, viscometry, and HPGPC. The {{results indicate that the}} introduction of small amounts of p-carboxybenzyl ether groups practically had no effect on the hydrodynamic properties in the case of KP, whereas, it was accompanied with a decrease of the molecular mass for LMP. The degradation was more pronounced during the benzyl <b>esterification</b> <b>of</b> LMP. The results confirmed that LMP is susceptible to chain cleavage due to Î²-elimination during both modification reactions. However, KP seems to be more tolerant of the reaction conditions.

40|$|To {{assess the}} subsites {{involved}} in substrate binding in Aspergillus niger endopolygalacturonase II, residues {{located in the}} potential substrate binding cleft stretching along the enzyme from the N to the C terminus were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant enzymes were characterized {{with respect to their}} kinetic parameters using polygalacturonate as a substrate and with respect to their mode of action using oligogalacturonates of defined length (n = 3 - 6). In addition, the effect of the mutations on the hydrolysis of pectins with various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> was studied. Based on the results obtained with enzymes N 186 E and D 282 K it was established that the substrate binds with the nonreducing end toward the N terminus of the enzyme. Asn 186 is located at subsite 4, and Asp 282 is located at subsite 2. The mutations D 183 N and M 150 Q, both located at subsite 2, affected catalysis, probably mediated via the sugar residue bound at subsite 1. Tyr 291, located at subsite 1 and strictly conserved among endopolygalacturonases appeared indispensable for effective catalysis. The mutations E 252 A and Q 288 E, both located at subsite 2, showed only slight effects on catalysis and mode of action. Tyr 326 is probably located at the imaginary subsite 3. The mutation Y 326 L affected the stability of the enzyme. For mutant E 252 A, an increased affinity for partially methylesterified substrates was recorded. Enzyme N 186 E displayed the opposite behavior; the specificity for completely demethylesterified regions of substrate, already high for the native enzyme, was increased. The origin {{of the effects of the}} mutations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The family Trimusculidae produce labdane diterpenes, which {{differ in}} the <b>degree</b> and type <b>of</b> <b>esterification</b> with acetoxy and isovaleroyl ester, predominantly. In this article, we {{describe}} the isolation from the marine pulmonate Trimusculus peruvianus, collected on intertidal rocks of Chilean coasts, of two new labdane diterpenes {{closely related to the}} above mentioned characteristics. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic data and correspond to 6 -hydroxy-labda- 8, 13 - dien- 15 -ol and 3, 19 -isovaleroyl- 6, 9 -dihydroxylabda- 8, 17, 13 -dien- 15 -oic acid.
