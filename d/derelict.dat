5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the <b>derelict</b> spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and <b>derelict</b> spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E

When the Federal rescue ship failed to report in, a second Federal patrol ship, backed up by a cruiser, discovered the two <b>derelicts</b> still docked together. The first rescue patrol ship, alarmingly, had suffered an internal explosion, but the Mary Mogab was intact and in perfect working order; on both <b>derelicts,</b> {{there were no signs}} that the crews had evacuated - they had simply vanished.|$|R

5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but {{also made it}} a target for property speculators. In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly <b>derelict</b> cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the <b>derelict</b> sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
