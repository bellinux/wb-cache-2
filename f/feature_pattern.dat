The invariant <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> representation of a training image is input to a Kohonen network, in order to obtain a description of the feature space in terms of so-called prototypical feature patterns (the weight vectors of the network). Supervised labeling of these prototypical feature patterns may be accomplished using classes derived from an a priori segmentation of the training image. We can segment any image similar to the training image by comparing the <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> representation of each pixel with all weight vectors, and assigning each pixel the class of the best matching weight vector.

Each volume element (voxel) is assigned a <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> {{consisting of a}} scaled family of differential geometrical invariant features. The invariant <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> is then assigned to a specific region using a two-stage neural network system.

40|$|Ultraprecision {{freeform}} surfaces (UPFSs) {{are increasingly}} being used in advanced optical systems due to their superior optical properties. However, current research on the measurement of machined UPFSs is still hindered by lack of efficient and robust form characterization techniques which can characterize the form error of measured freeform surfaces with submicrometer accuracy. This paper presents an invariant-feature-pattern-based form characterization (IFPFC) method. IFPFC makes use of intrinsic surface features (e. g., Gaussian curvature) to map the surface into an orientation-independent <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> to represent the surface geometry. Surface matching and comparison are then undertaken in terms of <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> registration. Compared with conventional methods, the IFPFC is not only robust to the initial position of the measured surface relative to the design template but also computationally efficient since it does not involve much iteration. A series of computer simulations and actual measurement are conducted to demonstrate the performance and {{the validity of the}} IFPFC method in the measurement and characterization of UPFSs with submicrometer form accuracy.

40|$|Abstract—Hemodialysis is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for pa-tients with end-stage renal disease. For hemodialysis, consistently functional vascular access must be surgically created with an anas-tomosis of artery and vein, referred to as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, AVF dysfunction may occur over time. Angiog-raphy and Doppler ultrasound are usually used to detect the flow or the diameter of the AVF. But they require well-trained opera-tors and are expensive, and even angiography is invasive. In this study, a noninvasive approach based on stethoscope auscultation for monitoring AVF stenosis was proposed. Here, a wireless blood flow sound recorder was designed to record blood flow sounds wire-lessly. In order to effectively extract the varying feature of blood flow sounds for AVF stenosis, the 2 -D <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> built from S-transform was also proposed as the feature in the AVF stenosis detecting algorithm. Different from other frequency-related coef-ficients, the <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> can contain the information of blood flow sounds in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Pre-liminary findings showed that the proposed approach can provide high-quality estimation of AVF stenosis (positive predictive value= 87. 84 % and sensitivity = 89. 24 %).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} joint user {{association}} and resource allocation in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) from a novel perspective, motivated by and generalizing {{the idea of}} fractional frequency reuse. By treating the multi-cell multi-user resource allocation as resource partitioning among multiple reuse patterns, we propose a unified framework to analyze and compare {{a wide range of}} user association and resource allocation strategies for HetNets, and provide an optimal benchmark for network performance. The enabling mechanisms are a novel formulation to consider all possible interference patterns or any pre-defined subset of patterns, and efficient sparsity-pursuit algorithms to find the solution. A notable feature of this formulation is that the patterns remain fixed during the resource optimization process. This creates a favorable opportunity for convex formulations while still considering interference coupling. More importantly, {{in view of the fact}} that multi-cell resource allocation is very computational demanding, our framework provides a systematic way to trade off performance for the reduction of computational complexity by restricting the candidate patterns to a small number of <b>feature</b> <b>patterns.</b> Relying on the sparsity-pursuit capability of the proposed algorithms, we develop a practical guideline to identify the <b>feature</b> <b>patterns.</b> Numerical results show that the identified <b>feature</b> <b>patterns</b> can significantly improve the existing strategies, and jointly optimizing the user association and resource allocation indeed brings considerable gain.

40|$|Feature selection, {{also known}} as {{attribute}} selection, is the technique of selecting a subset of relevant features for building robust object models. It {{is becoming more and}} more important for large-scale sensors applications with AI capabilities. The core idea of this paper is derived from a straightforward and intuitive principle saying that, if a feature subset (pattern) has more representativeness, it should be more self-organized, and as a result it should be more insensitive to artificially seeded noise points. In the light of this heuristic finding, we established the whole set of theoretical principles, based on which we proposed a two-stage framework to evaluate the relative importance of feature subsets, called seeding and harvest (S&amp;H for short). At the first stage, we inject a number of artificial noise points into the original dataset; then at the second stage, we resort to an outlier detector to identify them under various feature patterns. The more precisely the seeded points can be extracted under a particular <b>feature</b> <b>pattern,</b> the more valuable and important the corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>pattern</b> should be. Besides, we compared our method with several state-of-the-art feature selection methods on a number of real-life datasets.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that to maximize learning, intelligent tutoring systems should detect {{and respond to}} both cognitive student states, and affective and metacognitive states such as uncertainty. In intelligent tutoring research so far, student state detection is primarily based on information available from a single student-system exchange unit, or turn. However, the features used in the detection of such states may have a temporal component, spanning multiple turns, and may change throughout the tutoring process. To test this hypothesis, an interactive tool was implemented for the visual analysis of prosodic features across a corpus of student turns previously annotated for uncertainty. The tool consists of two complementary visualization modules. The first module allows researchers to visually mine the <b>feature</b> data for <b>patterns</b> per individual student dialogue, and form hypotheses about feature dependencies. The second module allows researchers to quickly test these hypotheses on groups of students through statistical visual analysis of feature dependencies. Results show that significant differences exist among <b>feature</b> <b>patterns</b> across different student groups.
