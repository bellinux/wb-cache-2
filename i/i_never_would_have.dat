She said [...] "I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> imagined 'My Hands' as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy XIII, but the strong female protagonist struck a chord with me and I can't wait to see Lightning do her thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Vargas Llosa has mainly {{lived in}} Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly {{three months of}} the year in Peru with his {{extended}} family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: [...] "I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: [...] "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reached this podium or become a known writer".|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

She would finish third in her heat and win the bronze medal scoring 6653 behind winner and upstart Nafissatou Thiam, with Jessica Ennis-Hill finishing second.

2500|$|Heston {{turned down}} the lead {{opposite}} Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love to appear in Benn W. Levy's play The Tumbler, directed by Laurence Olivier. Called a [...] "harrowingly pretentious verse drama" [...] by Time, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play {{to work with him}} as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, [...] "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier.

2500|$|Hitler {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933.

[...] Nevertheless, Mein Kampf was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s. During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front. [...] By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.|$|E

2500|$|Crumb {{first saw}} the film in February 1972, {{during a visit to}} Los Angeles with fellow {{underground}} cartoonists Spain Rodriguez, S.Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, and Rick Griffin. According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead. Crumb later {{said in an interview that}} he felt that the film was [...] "really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way.... I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively." [...] Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical left, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic" [...] and stated, [...] "They put words into his mouth that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had him say." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{offensive}} shootout {{became the}} first puntless game in NFL playoff history. For the second game in a row, Colts punter Hunter Smith took the day off while quarterback Peyton Manning completed 22 of 30 passes for 304 {{yards and three touchdowns}} (to Reggie Wayne, Brandon Stokley and Tom Lopienski), while Edgerrin James ran for a career postseason high 125 yards and two scores. On the Kansas City side, Dante Hall caught a touchdown and returned seven kickoffs for 207 yards and another score, and Priest Holmes, who set the regular-season rushing touchdown record in 2003, rushed for 176 yards, caught five passes for 32 yards, and scored twice. Kansas City's 33-year-old quarterback Trent Green threw for 212 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for 18 yards in his first career postseason game. A touchdown pass called back by a penalty and Holmes' third-quarter fumble, which set up a Colts' field goal, turned out to be too much for the Chiefs to overcome. Kansas City defensive coordinator Greg Robinson resigned the following week in disgrace. [...] "He is the master," [...] defensive end Eric Hicks said of Manning. [...] "That was an amazing performance. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought a quarterback would play two games in a row like that. They took us behind the woodshed and just beat us. It was embarrassing." ...|$|E
