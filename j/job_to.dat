40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} explored ethnic stereotypes, {{levels of}} blatant/subtle prejudice toward Africans and {{the relationships between}} these two dimensions in Italian university {{students with and without}} friends belonging to other ethnic groups.

University students with both low levels of blatant prejudice and high levels of subtle prejudice (Subtles) assigned more prestigious-intellectual <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> the Italians and practical-manual <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> the Africans than the others (Equalitarians).
