5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|Many Egyptologists and {{anthropologists have}} {{suggested}} theories {{about how the}} gods developed in these early times. Gustave Jéquier, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in human form, whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thorpe, {{whose parents}} were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E

He was killed in what some {{believed to have been}} an assassination. This was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> conclusively <b>prove,</b> because the killers were never caught or identified.|$|R
5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged macaw (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban macaw (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on Guadeloupe. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to Guadeloupe. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives, and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{definite}} evidence, except arguably in {{the form}} of photographs, makes birding records <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> but birdwatchers strive to build trust in their identification. One of the few major disputes was the case of the Hastings Rarities.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that it should be}} possible to do the construction so that the simple group itself is finitely presented. If so one would expect it to be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> as the mapping from presentations to simple groups would have to be non-recursive.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism is an Indian {{religion}} {{attributed to}} {{the teachings of the}} Buddha, supposedly born Siddhārtha Gautama, and also known as the Tathagata ("thus-gone") and Sakyamuni ("sage of the Sakyas"). The details of Buddha's life are mentioned in many Early Buddhist Texts but are inconsistent, and his social background and life details are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove,</b> the precise dates uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The {{place of}} origin is still speculative. According to Gregory it is {{possible}} that the manuscript was written and corrected in Jerusalem. It is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove,</b> but Palestine is still shown as the one of the possible places. Nothing is known of the early history of the codex until its discovery by Tischendorf in 1853.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{cases of}} {{assassination}} attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes {{been attributed to}} assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have been <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, {{but there is no}} evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.|$|E
30|$|The {{solution}} to problem (7) {{does not guarantee}} a global minimum solution for problem (6). Moreover, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> rigorously <b>prove</b> the convergence of the proposed alternating algorithm for problem (7). But we can prove that there exists a feasible solution for X, B, and F that can minimize the cost function in (6). This feasible solution is stated in the following theorem.|$|R
30|$|These {{inconsistent}} {{findings are}} probably related to differences of studied populations, retrospective nature of several studies, differences in diagnostic tests, the unmeasured confounders; therefore, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> establish <b>proved</b> causality {{based on the}} existing studies, necessitating future studies with strict methodology in relation to blinding, studied population, testing timing, and method of testing preferably with tissue studies to clarify the causal relation between CMV disease and ICU mortality and morbidity.|$|R
50|$|Lifelong learning, {{as defined}} by the OECD, {{includes}} a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> quantify or <b>prove,</b> but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.|$|R
25|$|The stripe-pattern of the Greek flag is visibly {{similar to}} that used (though with {{different}} colors) in several other flags that have appeared over the centuries, most notably that of the British East India Company's pre-1707 flag or the flag of the United States. However, in such cases of flags derived from much older designs, it is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> or trace original influences.|$|E
25|$|This {{last point}} is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Before the Ediacaran, the biostratigraphic markers usually used to {{correlate}} rocks are absent; therefore {{there is no}} way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.|$|E

The bill failed {{when it was}} voted on {{following}} a suspension of normal rules to stop debate and it required a 2/3 vote to pass. Opponents of the bill posit that price gouging is not widespread {{and that it is}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that it occurred. Roskam stated he voted against the bill as a protection of the free market.|$|E

In addition,there might be two sets of UMEB with different numbers. The main <b>difficult</b> is <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the unextendibility of the set of states. We give an explicit construction of UMEB by considering the Schmidt number of the complementary space of the states we construct. Comment: 4 pages,Physical Review A, June, 201...|$|R
50|$|Because these sleepwalking {{behaviours}} occur without volition, sleepwalking {{can be used}} as a legal defense. However, sleepwalking is a <b>difficult</b> case <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> It {{is impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> absolutely that a crime occurred in the context of a sleepwalking episode because there is no objective means to assess it retrospectively. It relies on probability and circumstantial evidence of a behavior that often has no witnesses (including the defendant, because amnesia is a feature of sleepwalking). Even a history of sleepwalking does not support that it was a factor during any given event.|$|R
50|$|The Treachery Act {{was deemed}} {{necessary}} because treason still {{had its own}} special rules of evidence and procedure which made it a <b>difficult</b> offence <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> and prosecute (see Treason Act 1695). The new offence of treachery, a felony, was designed to make securing convictions easier {{as it could be}} proved under the same rules of evidence as ordinary offences. It was also needed because there was doubt whether the treason laws were applicable to German saboteurs.|$|R
25|$|Forgiveness {{studies have}} been refuted by critics who claim {{that there is no}} direct {{correlation}} between forgiveness and physical health. Forgiveness, due to the reduction of directed anger, contributes to mental health and mental health contributes to physical health, but {{there is no evidence that}} forgiveness directly improves physical health. Most of the studies on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an independent variable in an individual's well-being, so it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> causation.|$|E
25|$|Decreased inhibin {{feedback}} after hysterectomy is {{hypothesized to}} contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of this factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur {{as a consequence of}} hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} this effect.|$|E
25|$|Suicide by {{pilot is}} an event in which a pilot {{deliberately}} crashes or attempts to crash an aircraft {{as a way to}} kill themself and sometimes passengers on board or people on the ground. This is sometimes described as a murder-suicide. It is suspected as being a possible cause of the crashes of several commercial flights and is confirmed as the cause in others. Generally, it is difficult for crash investigators to determine the motives of the pilots, since they sometimes act deliberately to turn off recording devices or otherwise hinder future investigations. As a result, pilot suicide can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> with certainty.|$|E

25|$|MDS {{most often}} {{develops}} without an identifiable cause. Risk factors include exposure to an agent {{known to cause}} DNA damage, like radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. It can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a connection between a suspected exposure {{and the development of}} MDS, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or Alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine, typically occurs 3-7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1-3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation. Other pre-existing bone marrow disorders like acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the frill and horns is problematic. The horns are rather short and the frill had such large fenestrae {{that it could not}} have offered much functional defense. Paul suggested that the beak was the main defensive weapon. It is possible that the frill was simply used to appear imposing or conceivably for thermoregulation. The frill may also have been brightly colored, to draw attention to its size or as part of a mating display. However, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> any sexual dimorphism. In 1933, Lull suggested that C. kaiseni, which bore long brow horns, was in fact the male of C. belli of which the females would have short ones. In 1927 C.M. Sternberg concluded that of the two skeletons he had mounted in the Canadian Museum of Nature, the smaller one, NMC 2245, was the male and the larger, NMC 2280, the female. However, today the two are referred to different species.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{challenging}} era {{for the department}} and its detectives. The city's homicides had almost quadrupled since the late 1950s, with a 30% increase {{in the previous year}} alone. There were many major crimes to investigate during his tenure. Two high-ranking figures in the city's Mafia were shot. Joseph Colombo Sr. was paralyzed from wounds inflicted by an assassin, himself killed seconds later, at an Italian Unity Day festival he had organized; although the department's investigation concluded it was not mob-related, Seedman continued to believe strongly that it had been even though he admitted it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Ten months later, Joe Gallo, another member of the Colombo crime family believed to have ordered the hit on his boss, was himself killed by gunmen at a Little Italy seafood restaurant. A prominent hotel's safe deposit boxes were robbed by gunmen dressed as guests. Seedman oversaw the investigations, and was the department's face in the media.|$|E

Though Islamic law prescribes punishments for Muslim men {{and women}} for the act of zinā, in practice it is an extremely <b>difficult</b> offense <b>to</b> <b>prove,</b> requiring four respectable witnesses to the actual act of penetration. Though in Western cultures premarital sex and loss of virginity may be considered shameful to the individual, in some Muslim societies an act of premarital sex, even if not falling within the legal standards of proof, may result in personal shame and loss of family honor.|$|R
