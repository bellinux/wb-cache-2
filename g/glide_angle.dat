2500|$|An example {{powered by}} a [...] E.N.V. Type F was bought in December 1909 by Claude Grahame-White, who named it the White Eagle. [...] However, Grahame White found the {{aircraft}} unsatisfactory, and it was later sold to Colonel Joseph Laycock and the Duke of Westminster, who presented it to the British War Office, making it the first heavier-than-air craft possessed by the Balloon School. [...] Lieutenant Reginald Cammell was sent to France to collect the aircraft. Cammell described the aircraft as dangerously unstable and having too steep a <b>glide</b> <b>angle.</b> At Larkhill it acquired the nickname [...] "The Man-Killer", and was eventually rebuilt by the Royal Aircraft Factory, who transformed it into the S.E.1.|$|E
2500|$|Since the new {{aircraft}} {{would require a}} significant amount of engineering work in untested waters, the first order placed was actually for a one-third scale version of the XB-35 dubbed the Northrop N-9M (M standing for model). This aircraft would be used to gather flight test data on the Flying Wing design, which would then be used in designing the big XB-35. It would also be used as a flight trainer, to familiarize pilots with the radical, all-wing concept. Early in 1942, design work on the XB-35 itself began in earnest. Unlike conventional aircraft, truly [...] "tailless" [...] flying wings cannot use a rudder for lateral control as it was absent, so a set of clamshell-like, double split flaps (so called flaperon, a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on the trailing edge of the wingtips were used. When aileron control was input, they were deflected up or down as a single unit, just like an aileron. When rudder input was made, the two surfaces on one side opened, top and bottom, creating drag, and yawing the aircraft. By applying input to both rudder pedals, both sets of surfaces were deployed creating drag so that the airspeed or the <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> could be manipulated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E

The Chemical Corps developed Flettner rotor bomblets and later triangular bomblets for wider coverage due to improved <b>glide</b> <b>angles</b> over Magnus-lift spherical bomblets.

5000|$|The origin for a polar {{curve is}} where the {{air-speed}} is zero and the sink rate is zero. In the first diagram a line has been drawn from the origin to the point with minimum sink. The slope of the line from the origin gives the <b>glide</b> <b>angle,</b> {{because it is the}} ratio of the distance along the airspeed axis to the distance along the sink rate axis. [...] A whole series of lines could be drawn from the origin to each of the data points, each line showing the <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> for that speed. However the best <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> is the line with the least slope. In the second diagram, the line has been drawn from the origin to the point representing the best glide ratio. The air-speed and sink rate at the best glide ratio can be read off the graph. Note that the best glide ratio is shallower than the glide ratio for minimum sink. All the other lines from the origin to the various data points would be steeper than the line of the best <b>glide</b> <b>angle.</b> Consequently, the line for the best <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> will only just graze the polar curve, i.e. it is a tangent.|$|E
50|$|Several {{variants}} were considered: Wolfgang Hütter detailed a simplified, fixed sprung monowheel version, {{reducing the}} weight so a shorter span, lower wing area design could still meet the RLM's required <b>glide</b> <b>angles.</b> Karl Schewyer and Ferdinand Schmetz both designed tandem seated competition variants, respectively {{with a high}} wing and demountable undercarriage and a low wing, retractable undercarriage. There is no evidence any of these were completed.|$|R
50|$|Speed {{flying and}} Speed riding {{requires}} different wing sizes {{because of the}} different <b>glide</b> <b>angles,</b> and launch techniques. Speed flying requires a larger, slower wing for foot launches (between 13 and 18 square metres), while Speed riding involves a faster, smaller, ski-launched wing (between 8 and 14 square metres). This allows the pilot to periodically touch down and speed ride the slope on skis or a snowboard.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, the {{structure}} of the A-9 was heavy and so the wing loading was high at 30.5 kg/m² (6.2 lb/ft2), compared, for example, with the Slingsby T.25 Gull 4, a contemporary glider with a wing loading of 22.3 kg/m² (4.6 lb/ft2). [...] Higher wing loadings provide higher speeds and better <b>glide</b> <b>angles</b> between thermals but poor climbing in weak lift. The Red Front 7 is known to have used water ballast on its record flight but the A-9 was not thus equipped.|$|R

50|$|The MOBA 2C had {{its first}} {{competitive}} outing at the 1980 Australian Championships at Benalla. Sunderland judged its performance as between the 15 m {{class and the}} Standard Class gliders there, perhaps rather closer to the latter. He could out-turn the 15 m aircraft in thermals but they, 100 kg (220 lb) heavier flew faster at the same <b>glide</b> <b>angle.</b> He estimated that the MOBA 2C approximately achieved its 1:38 design <b>glide</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

Their nest holes usually at least 10m above ground. The red giant flying squirrel is nocturnal and does not hibernate, but migrates to areas with more food.

50|$|The {{transport}} ministry’s Osaka Regional Civil Aviation Bureau {{stated that}} the crew tried to land the aircraft in darkness and inclement weather without access to an instrument landing system. At this airport, aircraft normally approach from the west because the instrument landing system is installed only at {{the eastern end of}} the runway. On this occasion, the pilot was instructed by an air traffic controller to approach from the east due to the wind direction. Bureau officials were reported to have {{stated that the}} pilot attempted to land in poor weather with low visibility while using such aids as the lighting near the centre-line of the runway that indicates <b>glide</b> <b>angles</b> (normally used in good weather conditions).|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s {{into the}} 1950s, U.S. and Royal Navy LSOs {{used a variety}} of signals to assist pilots landing aboard {{aircraft}} carriers.

50|$|A {{helicopter}} operated {{with heavy}} loads in high density altitude or gusty wind conditions can achieve best performance from a slightly increased airspeed in the descent. At low density altitude and light loading, best performance is achieved from a slight decrease in normal airspeed.

40|$|As the {{international}} air traffic {{becomes more and}} more complex there is a growing demand for new operational procedures. Especially quiet and fuel efficient approaches are desired. As a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) provides more flexibility than current precision landing systems it is identified as a potential main technology for providing different approach procedures tailored for the demands at a special location. Especially steep precision approaches have a high noise reducing potential as the aircraft can stay at a higher altitude for a longer time. Due to its flexibility a GBAS Landing System (GLS) provides the opportunity to design different approach procedures tailored for the demands at a special location. During this work approach procedures based on GLS with slightly higher <b>glide</b> path <b>angles</b> than usual (4 ° - 5 ° instead of 3 ° - 3, 5 °) were investigated. The approach paths with steeper <b>glide</b> path <b>angles</b> were integrated into an experimental ground station and flight trials were conducted to evaluate the new approaches. Different pilots conducted different approaches with different glide path angels. After each approach the pilots were questioned about the subjective work load and the flight technical demands. Furthermore noise measurements were carried out during a flight trial with a B- 737 of Air Berlin. The results of the flight trials are going to be presented and a comparison of the position deviations during different approaches with different <b>glide</b> path <b>angles</b> will be conducted...|$|R

A straight line from the origin to some point on the curve has a gradient equal to the <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> at that speed, so the corresponding tangent shows the best <b>glide</b> <b>angle</b> [...] ≃ 3.3°. This is not the lowest rate of sink but provides the greatest range, requiring a speed of 240 km/h (149 mph); the minimum sink rate of about 3.5 m/s is at 180 km/h (112 mph), speeds seen in the previous, powered plots.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the patagial membranes of gliding vertebrates, the aerodynamic surfaces used by falling wingless ants to direct their aerial descent are unknown. We conducted ablation experiments to assess the relative contributions of the hindlegs, midlegs and gaster to gliding success in workers of the Neotropical arboreal ant Cephalotes atratus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Removal of hindlegs significantly reduced the success rate of directed aerial descent {{as well as the}} glide index for successful flights. Removal of the gaster alone did not significantly alter performance relative to controls. Equilibrium <b>glide</b> <b>angles</b> during successful targeting to vertical columns were statistically equivalent between control ants and ants with either the gaster or the hindlegs removed. High-speed video recordings suggested possible use of bilaterally asymmetric motions of the hindlegs to effect body rotations about the vertical axis during targeting manoeuvre. Overall, the control of gliding flight was remarkably robust to dramatic anatomical perturbations, suggesting effective control mechanisms in the face of adverse initial conditions (e. g. falling upside down), variable targeting decisions and turbulent wind gusts during flight...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding {{considerable}} {{effort by}} many researchers world-wide, {{the estimation of}} community noise due to changes in aircraft fleets and operations remains subject to considerable uncertainty. This paper describes a new taxonomical architecture for aircraft noise prediction models that {{can be adapted to}} differing levels of input data and required outputs. Sound levels on the ground are estimated at base level using existing tools (such as INM or ANCON). The aim then is to determine variations on this base level depending upon differences in known input data whilst by-passing the full complexity of engineering models for which the necessary inputs can often only be assumed or are not even available for particular cases. The architecture is well-adapted for estimating incremental change associated with single input variables, such as approach <b>glide</b> slope <b>angle,</b> or flight track concentration associated with performance based radio navigation. The research is being carried out as part of a wider effort to better understand environmental and economic interdependencies, for which taxonomical models can be highly beneficial.

40|$|As flight progressed from {{propellers}} to jets to rockets, the propulsive energy grew exponentially. With {{the development}} of rocket-only boosted vehicles, energy management of these boost-gliders became a distinct requirement for the unpowered return to base, alternate landing site, or water-parachute landing, starting with the X-series rocket aircraft and terminating with the present-day Shuttle. The problem presented here consists of: speed (kinetic energy) - altitude (potential energy) - steep <b>glide</b> <b>angles</b> created by low lift-to-drag ratios (L/D) - distance to landing site - and the bothersome effects of the atmospheric characteristics varying with altitude. The primary discussion regards post-boost, stabilized glides; however, the effects of centrifugal and geopotential acceleration are discussed as well. The aircraft and spacecraft discussed here are the X- 1, X- 2, X- 15, and the Shuttle; and to a lesser, comparative extent, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and lifting bodies. The footprints, landfalls, and methods developed for energy management are also described. The essential tools required for energy management - simulator planning, instrumentation, radar, telemetry, extended land or water range, Mission Control Center (with specialist controllers), and emergency alternate landing sites - were first established through development of early concepts and were then validated by research flight tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a feasibility study to use GBAS for approaches to secondary airports {{in the vicinity of the}} prime airport where the system is located. The evaluations are based on a maximum vertical error at a desired decision height (e. g. 200 ft which corresponds to the CAT-I minimum) which may not be exceeded with a certain probability. This is taken as a starting point to ensure that no collisions with terrain or obstacles can occur. The tolerable vertical error is mainly determined by four parameters: the obstacle clearance surface, the total system error including navigation sensor and flight technical error, the <b>glide</b> path <b>angle</b> of the approach and the ionospheric threat model. In this paper we investigate the influence of all those parameters on the possibility to provide approaches down to the CAT-I limit at close-by airports. The main concern for such an application is the influence of possible undetected ionospheric gradients. For all other effects no significant decorrelation of errors over several kilometers which is not accounted for can be expected. Results show that such operations can be feasible at airports within about 24 km of the GBAS under the German iono threat model and with an assumed <b>glide</b> path <b>angle</b> of 3 °. ...|$|R
40|$|Fossils of the {{remarkable}} dromaeosaurid Microraptor gui and relatives clearly show well-developed flight feathers on the hind limbs {{as well as the}} front limbs. No modern vertebrate has hind limbs functioning as independent, fully developed wings; so, lacking a living example, little agreement exists on the functional morphology or likely flight configuration of the hindwing. Using a detailed reconstruction based on the actual skeleton of one individual, cast in the round, we developed light-weight, three-dimensional physical models and performed glide tests with anatomically reasonable hindwing configurations. Models were tested with hindwings abducted and extended laterally, as well as with a previously described biplane configuration. Although the hip joint requires the hindwing to have at least 20 ° of negative dihedral (anhedral), all configurations were quite stable gliders. <b>Glide</b> <b>angles</b> ranged from 3 ° to 21 ° with a mean estimated equilibrium angle of 13. 7 °, giving a lift to drag ratio of 4. 1 : 1 and a lift coefficient of 0. 64.

Although the biplane model glided almost {{as well as the other}} models, it was structurally deficient and required an unlikely weight distribution (very heavy head) for stable gliding.
