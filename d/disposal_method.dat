5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>disposal</b> <b>method,</b> transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E

25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often medical waste, {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps <b>disposal</b> <b>method</b> allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion did not question California's {{assertion that the}} moratorium was justified because {{the lack of a}} permanent <b>disposal</b> <b>method</b> for high level waste made nuclear generation uneconomic. It has been noted that existing plants and plants constructed after the Supreme Court decision have continued to economically operate by expanding current waste storage facilities. In addition, by simply citing examples of the costs of cancelled nuclear construction projects such as WNP-3 and WNP-5 or Marble Hill, or of cost over-runs at plants such as Braidwood, a state could justify a statutory moratorium on all new nuclear generating plants on the basis that these plants are inherently uneconomic.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the influence of socioeconomic attributes of residents on domestic solid waste <b>disposal</b> <b>methods</b> in Lagos metropolis, Nigeria. Primary data for the study were obtained through questionnaire administered on residents in Eti-Osa, Ikeja, and Mushin Local Government Areas (LGAs) representing the low, medium, and high densities, respectively, into which the sixteen LGAs in Lagos metropolis were stratified. One {{out of every four}} wards in each LGA was selected for survey. From a total of 15, 275 residential buildings in the ten wards, one out of every forty buildings (2. 5 %) was selected using systematic random sampling where a household head was sampled. Information obtained includes the residential characteristics and the <b>disposal</b> <b>methods.</b> Enquiries into the socioeconomic attributes of the residents showed that 59. 9 % were high income earners and 76. 6 % had attained tertiary school education. This study concluded that six <b>disposal</b> <b>methods</b> were common in the study area. Furthermore, through multinomial logistic regression, the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of residents (density, income, age of respondents, educational status, and length of stay) on domestic solid waste <b>disposal</b> <b>methods</b> varied significantly in Lagos metropolis.

25|$|The {{quality of}} sewage sludge is {{controlled}} under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants {{and those that do}} not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of <b>disposal</b> <b>method.</b> EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.|$|E
500|$|From 1963 to 1997 local municipal-owned {{electric}} generators provided Tubas {{with all}} of its electricity needs. In 1997, the city connected with the Tubas Area Electricity Network which is provided by the Israeli Electric Cooperation. In that period, 99% of households in the city were connected with electricity. Solid waste management in Tubas is operated by the municipality and Joint Services Council. It is collected 3-4 times daily from the residential area, which is sent to a shared dumping site [...] from the city. The main <b>disposal</b> <b>method</b> used is burning. Tubas is not connected to the sewage network, therefore all households dispose of their waste water in cesspits, a major source of pollution in groundwater.|$|E
2500|$|Incineration is a <b>disposal</b> <b>method</b> {{in which}} solid organic wastes are {{subjected}} to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of residue of both solid waste management and solid residue from waste water management. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume. Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as [...] "thermal treatment". Incinerators convert waste materials into heat, gas, steam, and ash.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{the source}} and ingredients, there are various {{ways in which the}} public can dispose of {{pharmaceutical}} and personal care products. In the case of pharmaceutical products, the most environmentally safe <b>disposal</b> <b>method</b> is {{to take advantage of a}} community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal. [...] Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated pharmaceutical take-back programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs as well as a program called the National Take Back Initiative. Currently, take back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction. [...] This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products. Take back programs should exist in every community, and if further information is required on the matter the city officials should be contacted.
