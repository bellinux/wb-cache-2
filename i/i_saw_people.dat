500|$|Pierre Sévigny, {{who would}} be elected an MP in 1958, {{recalled}} the gathering, [...] "When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after." [...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and {{sitting there in the}} front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Channel 4 {{exclusively}} revealed {{two individuals}} {{who witnessed the}} final violent stage on May 2009 who claimed a military commander and Sri Lanka's defence secretary ordered war crimes. One stated [...] "They shot people at random. Stabbed people. Raped them. Cut out their tongues, cut women's breasts off. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> soaked in blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> {{laughing}} and listening and standing {{very close to}} one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn't see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by the {{commitment}} of the mujahedeen, Begg said he travelled to Bosnia in the early 1990s to help the Muslims during the war. He said he was [...] "terribly affected by some of the stories ... of the atrocities taking place there". In 1994 he joined a charity that worked with Muslims in Bosnia. He states he [...] "very briefly" [...] joined the Bosnian Army Foreign Volunteer Force: [...] "In Bosnia, I did fight for a while. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> horribly damaged, and I thought, This is not for me". Begg first met Khalil Deek in Bosnia.|$|E
2500|$|Kitana {{was chosen}} as the best Mortal Kombat II fighter by the editors of Sega Power and Super Play for being [...] "good all around" [...] and due to her quick attacks and {{perceived}} similarities to Chun-Li. Amiga Power too called her [...] "a really good character to pick" [...] and Cinema Blend stated Kitana [...] "could absolutely dominate" [...] the game. However, GamePro's strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in MKII (citing her devastating combos, powerful [...] "Fan Throw" [...] move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by Complex, Kitana [...] "had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps." [...] "Kitana's big combos in the corner" [...] were among Ed Boon's own personal favourite things in the game: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> do Kitana's combos I knew there was something special, because people were taking the game to a new direction." [...] EGM described Kitana as [...] "a force to be reckoned with" [...] and predicted she would [...] "make a big impact as her Fan Wave leaves foes open to combos." [...] In the Game Gear version of MKII, however, Kitana's fan lifts the opponent too low and too far away for an easy combo.|$|E
60|$|A violent {{explosion}} {{shook the}} air, and a spout of water, steam, mud, and shattered metal shot far {{up into the}} sky. As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Altrurian replied, [...] "I gave half {{a dollar}} apiece {{for them at}} the station in Boston. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> other <b>people</b> doing it," [...] he explained, noting my surprise. [...] "Isn't it the custom?" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was just}} the {{greatest}} thing <b>I</b> ever <b>saw.</b> <b>People</b> were jumping around and hollering and hugging each other just like they’d won a football game. I decided on the spot that I wanted to become an oilman.|$|R
60|$|Religion {{is still}} very strong. I went into many churches, where <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{obviously}} famished priests in gorgeous vestments, and a congregation enormously devout. Generally {{more than half the}} congregation were men, and among the men many were soldiers. This applies to the towns {{as well as to the}} country. In Moscow <b>I</b> constantly <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> in the streets crossing themselves.|$|R
60|$|In all {{the rooms}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> of the poorer classes, some of whom seemed to view the objects intelligently, and to take a genuine {{interest}} in them. A poor man in London has great opportunities of cultivating himself if he will only {{make the best of}} them; and such an institution as the British Museum can hardly fail to attract, as the magnet does steel, the minds that are likeliest to be benefited by it in its various departments. I saw many children there, and some ragged boys.|$|E
60|$|Few {{people who}} {{are old enough to}} {{remember}} it will ever forget the August of two years ago, if only because of the phenomenal heat. Up to that month the year had been very cold, so cold that even during July there were some evenings when a fire was welcome, while on several days <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> driving about the roads wrapped up in heavy ulsters. But with the first day of August all this changed, and suddenly the climate became torrid, the nights especially being extraordinarily hot. From every quarter of the country came complaints of the great heat, while each issue of the newspapers contained lists of those who had fallen victims to it.|$|E
60|$|Crossing {{the ferry}} into Boston, {{we went to}} the City Tavern, where the bar-room {{presented}} a Sabbath scene of repose,--stage-folk lounging in chairs half asleep, smoking cigars, generally with clean linen and other niceties of apparel, to mark the day. The doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment shop across the street were closed, but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> enter it. There were two owls in a back court, visible through a window of the bar-room,--speckled gray, with dark-blue eyes,--the queerest-looking birds that exist,--so solemn and wise,--dozing away the day, much {{like the rest of the}} people, only that they looked wiser than any others. Their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses. A dull scene this. A stranger, here and there, poring over a newspaper. Many of the stage-folk sitting in chairs on the pavement, in front of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{fortunate}} we are, too,' I returned, 'to {{have arrived}} to witness their happiness in that intended marriage! <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> so happy. How delightful to see it, {{and to be}} made the sharers in their honest joy, as we have been!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They think I've insulted THEM--they're in {{an awful}} state--they're almost dead. Mr. Flack {{has put it}} into the paper--everything, I don't know what--and they think it's too wicked. They were all there together--all at me at once, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> so affected." ...|$|R
5000|$|First {{recorded}} performance: 1 March 1662 at Lincoln's Inn Fields, {{performed by}} the Duke's Company. Samuel Pepys wrote of the production (the first since the reopening of the theatres), [...] "it is the play of itself the worst that ever I heard in my life, and the worst acted that ever <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> these <b>people</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{a side of}} my {{character}} which I did not know till lately,' Arthur said at last. 'When first it dawned upon me, I fought against it. I said to myself that deep down in all of us, a relic from the long past, is {{the remains of the}} superstition that blinded our fathers; and it is needful for the man of science to fight against it with all his might. And yet it was stronger than I. Perhaps my birth, my early years, in those Eastern lands where everyone believes in the supernatural, affected me although I did not know it. I began to remember vague, mysterious things, which I never knew had been part of my knowledge. And at last one day it seemed that a new window was opened on to my soul, and I saw with extraordinary clearness the incident which you had described. I knew suddenly it was part of my own experience. I saw you take me by the hand and pour the ink on my palm and bid me look at it. I felt again the strange glow that thrilled me, and with an indescribable bitterness I saw things in the mirror which were not there before. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> whom I had never seen. I saw them perform certain actions. And some force I knew not, obliged me to speak. And at length everything grew dim, and I was as exhausted as if I had not eaten all day.' ...|$|E
60|$|So we {{advanced}} {{into this}} ghostly city, continuing to hold our course through narrow streets and lanes, all filled and flowing with water. Some {{of the corners}} where our way branched off, were so acute and narrow, that it seemed impossible for the long slender boat to turn them; but the rowers, with a low melodious cry of warning, sent it skimming on without a pause. Sometimes, the rowers of another black boat like our own, echoed the cry, and slackening their speed (as I thought we did ours) would come flitting past us like a dark shadow. Other boats, of the same sombre hue, were lying moored, I thought, to painted pillars, near to dark mysterious doors that opened straight upon the water. Some of these were empty; in some, the rowers lay asleep; towards one, I saw some figures coming down a gloomy archway from {{the interior of a}} palace: gaily dressed, and attended by torch-bearers. It was but a glimpse I had of them; for a bridge, so low and close upon the boat that it seemed ready to fall down and crush us: one of the many bridges that perplexed the Dream: blotted them out, instantly. On we went, floating towards the heart of this strange place--with water all about us where never water was elsewhere-- clusters of houses, churches, heaps of stately buildings growing out of it--and, everywhere, the same extraordinary silence. Presently, we shot across a broad and open stream; and passing, as I thought, before a spacious paved quay, where the bright lamps with which it was illuminated showed long rows of arches and pillars, of ponderous construction and great strength, but as light to the eye as garlands of hoarfrost or gossamer--and where, for the first time, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> walking--arrived at a flight of steps leading from the water to a large mansion, where, having passed through corridors and galleries innumerable, I lay down to rest; listening to the black boats stealing up and down below the window on the rippling water, till I fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the cities}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> {{drinking}} a delicious beverage made of chalk and water, but never once saw goats driven through their Broadway or their Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery street and milked {{at the doors}} of the houses. I saw real glass windows in the houses of even the commonest people. Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet of bricks; I solemnly swear they are made of wood. Houses there will take fire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely down, and not leave a single vestige behind. I could state that for a truth, upon my death-bed. And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I aver that they have a thing which they call a fire-engine, which vomits forth great streams of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and by day, to rush to houses that are burning. You would think one engine would be sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep men hired, and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires. For a certain sum of money other men will insure that your house shall not burn down; and if it burns they will pay you for it. There are hundreds and thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, like a priest. In that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is damned; he can not buy salvation with money for masses. There is really not much use in being rich, there. Not much use as far as the other world is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; because there, if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become a legislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no matter how ignorant an ass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold all the great places, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots. There, if a man be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, they invite him to drink complicated beverages; but if he be poor and in debt, they require him to do that which they term to 'settle.' The women put on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usually fine, but absurd in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changes twice in a hundred years; and did I but covet to be called an extravagant falsifier, I would say it changed even oftener. Hair does not grow upon the American women's heads; it is made for them by cunning workmen in the shops, and is curled and frizzled into scandalous and ungodly forms. Some persons wear eyes of glass which they see through with facility perhaps, else they would not use them; and in the mouths of some are teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man. The dress of the men is laughably grotesque. They carry no musket in ordinary life, nor no long-pointed pole; they wear no wide green-lined cloak; they wear no peaked black felt hat, no leathern gaiters reaching to the knee, no goat-skin breeches with the hair side out, no hob-nailed shoes, no prodigious spurs. They wear a conical hat termed a 'nail-keg;' a coat of saddest black; a shirt which shows dirt so easily {{that it has to be}} changed every month, and is very troublesome; things called pantaloons, which are held up by shoulder straps, and on their feet they wear boots which are ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear. Yet dressed in this fantastic garb, these people laughed at my costume. In that country, books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one. Newspapers also. They have a great machine which prints such things by thousands every hour.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} they {{returned}} to Beijing, the Cultural Revolution had begun to have serious repercussions for the Zhang family. Hongtu was criticized for his bad family background and his interest in Western art. He was then prohibited from painting Mao’s portrait. Looking back on his long march, Zhang Hongtu has said: “Nobody bothered me at that time about my family background. It was nice to see the landscape, so nice for a city boy. But after this trip, I changed a lot. The bad part is, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> kill each other, literally. I began to ask, ‘Is this really the Cultural Revolution?’ <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>people</b> put so many books all together like a hill and then burn them. I saw so many poor people, it was beyond my imagination. The reality of it didn’t fit my imagination of the Cultural Revolution.
