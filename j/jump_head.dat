40|$|Gait {{disturbances}} {{are one of}} {{the main}} limiting factors for autonomy and quality of life in individuals with Parkinson&# 8217;s disease (PD), and freezing of gait (FoG) is a common phenomenon that affects one-third of this population. Thus the effect of the implementation of a therapeutic program in a sensorimotor virtual environment through the Nintendo&# 174; Wii Fit&# 8482; plus platform on the motor impairment caused by FoG in individuals with PD is analyzed. A sample of 30 volunteers with PD was subdivided into a control group (CG), consisting of participants without FoG, and the experimental group (EG), consisting of individuals with FoG. Those selected were assessed before and after the experiment through the motor segment of the Unified Parkinson&# 8217;s Disease Rating Scale of daily activities by Schwab and England, the Quality of Life for PD, Time Up and Go Test, and the FoG identification questionnaire, the last one being only in the EG. The training was divided into three categories: aerobic (step and boxing), balance (ski slalom, ski <b>jump,</b> <b>head</b> shots and tightrope), and exercise plus (segway and cycling). Both groups improved gait performance, with significant improvement of the impairments originated by the FoG, as well as improvement in motor bouts, quality of life and independence in their daily activities...|$|E

40|$|Lower-extremity {{injury is}} common in soccer. A {{number of studies have}} begun to assess why {{specific}} lower-extremity injuries occur. However, currently few studies have examined how footwear affects lower-extremity mechanics. In order to address this question, 14 male (age: 22. 1 ± 3. 9 years, height: 1. 77 ± 0. 06 m, and mass: 73. 3 ± 11. 5 kg) and 14 female (age: 22. 8 ± 3. 1 years, height: 1. 68 ± 0. 07 m and mass: 64. 4 ± 9. 2 kg) competitive soccer players underwent a motion analysis assessment while performing a <b>jump</b> <b>heading</b> task. Each subject performed the task in three different footwear conditions (running shoe, bladed cleat, and turf shoe). Two-way analyses of variance were used to examine statistical differences in landing mechanics between the footwear conditions while controlling for gender differences. These comparisons were made during two different parts (prior to and following) of a soccer-specific <b>jump</b> <b>heading</b> task. A statistically significant interaction for the peak dorsiflexion angle (P= 0. 02) and peak knee flexion angle (P= 0. 05) was observed. Male soccer players exhibited a degree increase in dorsiflexion in the bladed cleat while female soccer players exhibited a three-degree reduction in peak knee flexion in the bladed cleat condition. Other main effects for gender and footwear were also observed. The results suggest that landing mechanics differ based upon gender, footwear, and the type of landing. Therefore, training interventions aimed at reducing lower-extremity injury should consider utilizing sport-specific footwear when assessing movement patterns. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While builders like Soultone have managed to survive this onslaught by combining modern and vintage processes, techniques, and materials, much of this cottage industry is quickly vanishing. Only time will tell if any of these new companies will remain viable, as the big four manufacturers become more responsive to potential buyer's actual desires, thanks largely to the internet.
