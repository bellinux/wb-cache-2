5000|$|As {{reflected}} in their cylindrical form, casts are generated in the small distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, and generally maintain their shape and composition as they pass through the urinary system. Although the most common forms are benign, others indicate disease. All rely on the inclusion or adhesion of various elements on a mucoprotein base—the <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast.</b> [...] "Cast" [...] itself merely describes the shape, so an adjective is added to describe {{the composition of the}} cast. Various casts found in urine sediment may be classified as follows.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of cast, <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> are {{solidified}} Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein secreted from the tubular epithelial cells of individual nephrons. Low urine flow, concentrated urine, or an acidic environment can contribute to the formation of hyaline casts, and, as such, they may be seen in normal individuals in dehydration or vigorous exercise. Hyaline casts are cylindrical and clear, with a low refractive index, so that they can easily be missed on cursory review under brightfield microscopy, or in an aged sample where dissolution has occurred whereas, on the other hand, phase contrast microscopy leads to easier identification. Given the ubiquitous presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein, other cast types are formed via the inclusion or adhesion of other elements to the hyaline base.|$|E
40|$|Background Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{and experimental}} researches indicate that in utero exposure to some environmental chemicals and prescribed drugs during pregnancy can mediate various embryonic abnormalities and complications via {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) generation, which damages cellular macromolecules. Objectives The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the sulfonamide-associated nephrotoxicity with possible underlying mechanisms in chicken embryo. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, one hundred fertile eggs were obtained and divided into five groups: 1) control group (without injection), 2) group injected with 2 mg sulfadiazine, 3) group injected with 10 mg sulfadiazine, 4) group injected with 30 mg sulfadiazine and 5) group injected with 70 mg sulfadiazine. After hatching, the renal tissue from the newly hatched chick was harvested for histopathologic investigation and also measurement of oxidative stress parameters [the ferric reducing capacity assay, the glutathione content (GSH) and the situation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) ] by spectrophotometer. Results Histologic examination of the renal tissue revealed that sulfadiazine induces hydropic degeneration, tubular necrosis, glomerular and tubular atrophy, formation of <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast,</b> congestion, hemorrhage, interstitial nephritis and fibrosis. Conclusions Result showed the dose-dependent administration of sulfadiazine significantly altered the histopathologic structure of renal tissues of chickens. Furthermore, the major histopathologic events in the course of sulfadiazine cytotoxicity are renal tubule epithelial cell necrosis, interstitial nephritis and fibrosis, formation of <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> and congestion and hemorrhage, although sulfadiazine at dose 30 mg and 70 mg caused perturbation in antioxidant defense system by marked increase in LPO, and decrease in GSH...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} was {{produced}} in vasopression-pretreated rabbits by clamping the left renal pedicle for one hour and removing the opposite kidney. Treatment with clonidine, as antihypertensive drug that blunts the kidney's response to vasopressin, resulted in significantly higher creatinine clearance and urine flow rate in the first 6 hours after unclamping. Clonidine (30 microgram/kg given intravenously 30 minutes before unclamping) also significantly lessened the number of <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> in outer medullary tubules and inner medullary loops of Henle 6 hours after unclamping and {{reduced the number of}} abnormal tubular contours in microadiograms produced by infusing barium sulfate into the renal artery at sufficient pressure to rupture glomerular capillaries, causing an escape of contrast material into the tubules. The spaces consistently observed between the ends of barium columns and <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> in microdissection studies and the great lengths of the <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> suggest that <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> obstruct the flow of tubular fluid. Clonidine treatment resulted in fewer, shorter, and thinner <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts.</b> These results indicate that tubular obstruction by <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> {{plays an important role in}} early postischemic acute renal failure, and that clonidine's beneficial effect is due in part to a reduction in cast formation...|$|R

30|$|Ischemic acute tubular {{necrosis}} (ATN) {{is by far}} the most common cause of DGF. Ischemic ATN is caused by prolonged renal hypoperfusion leading to energy depletion and impaired homeostasis. Ischemia starves the tissue from oxygen and nutrients and causes accumulation of metabolic waste products and prolonged ischemia, and the following reperfusion may result in reversible as well as irreversible damage and cellular death. The return of oxygen to the tissue after reestablishment of blood perfusion results in generation of reactive oxygen species. Reactive free radicals cause cell membrane damage and oxidation of membrane proteins and DNA leading to increased cell membrane permeability and enzymatic disturbances [3, 6, 20]. Despite the term ATN, actual necrosis of tubular epithelium cells is a less common finding than cellular injury and dysfunction. These forms of cell injury can include apoptosis, loss of cell-forming gaps in the tubular architecture and denuded basement membranes, and cells sloughing into tubular lumens [9]. In animal models, luminal <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> formations are seen, which can cause obstruction and dilation of the tubules [9, 21, 22].|$|E
40|$|Background: C. trinodisis {{brown algae}} of Oman Sea coast is used {{traditionally}} as a diuretic in Chabahar, Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran. But no researches {{have been conducted}} on the distractive effects of this alga on the renal tissues until now. Methods: Forty-two adult male mice were divided into 6 groups.

All animals in 6 groups were treated for 2 weeks (once every other day). Finally, histopathological evaluations were made especially by morphology and photometric method. Results: ME of C. trinodis induced histological damage in kidney. Administration of ME in all experimental groups induced severe glomerular congestion, <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> and severe interstitial inflammatory centers in treated groups.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the ameliorating effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and/or trans-retinol precursor (â-carotene) on monosodium glutamate (MSG) -induced oxidative damage in the kidney of rats. For this purpose, oxidative status was monitored through estimating renal contents of malondialdehyde (MDA, index of lipid peroxidation), L-ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione (GSH) and serum nitric oxide (NO) levels. Histopathological examination of renal tissue was also assessed. In MSG group, the convoluted tubules showed cloudy swelling and the interstitial tissue showed congestion & oedema in both cortex and medulla with a <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> in the latter. Co-administration of NAC, â-carotene and their combination to MSG-treated rats returned the renal cortex and medulla to their normal architecture. The increase in serum levels of urea, creatinine & NO and renal MDA and the decrease in renal GSH and L-ascorbic acid induced by subcutaneous injection of MSG were reversed by treatment with NAC and/or â-carotene. Combination of these two antioxidants showed the most promising results in ameliorating some renal disorders induced by MSG.

40|$|Lysine {{is a major}} {{constituent}} of amino acid parenteral nutrition solutions which have recently been shown {{to increase the severity}} of various types of acute renal failure in the rat. In previous studies the authors have shown that high-dose lysine alone is capable of causing acute renal failure. However, it has remained unclear what the morphologic expression of this type of acute renal failure is in the maintenance phase of the syndrome, whether other amino acids produce a similar lesion, and whether lysine in lower doses also produces acute renal failure. In the present study the authors show that lysine, when given in a dose of 600 mg/rat over 4 hours, produced persisting acute renal failure which at 48 hours was characterized morphologically by a picture similar to that in human "acute tubular necrosis" [...] little overt tubular necrosis, but a focal loss of individual tubular cells with regenerative changes and mitotic figures. Extensive <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> formation was seen, particularly in the thin limbs of the loops of Henle, and these thin limb casts were shown to contain Tamm-Horsfall protein.

We examined kidney tissue from infected animals for evidence of renal damage by using standard cytochemical and immunoenzyme methods. We also monitored changes in renal function during a 6 -month study period with standard biochemical assays of plasma and urine. Histologic examination showed tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and a mononuclear infiltrate in proportion to ureaplasma counts from renal tissue. The most severe damage was accompanied by <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> formation within tubules which gave rise to the typical thyroidlike appearance of chronic pyelonephritis involving conventional urinary pathogens. Macroscopic renal scarring occurred in some animals. Although damage to the renal medulla was moderate to severe, only minor changes were seen in the cortex, and glomeruli were invariably spared. Biochemical tests of renal function showed similar changes in infected and uninfected animals during the study period. Interstitial inflammation was characterized by a mononuclear cell infiltrate in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes were not conspicuous. It is evident that U. urealyticum is capable of producing chronic pyelonephritis in the rat after a single reflux challenge. The results of this study have obvious implications for the pathogenicity of these bacteria in human pyelonephritis...|$|E

40|$|Tamm-Horsfall protein (TH protein), a renal {{epithelial}} glycoprotein, {{was isolated}} originally from human urine [1, 2]. This membrane glycoprotein has several unusual physicochemical characteristics that may determine {{its role in}} normal tubular function in its distal nephron site of synthesis and in pathologic conditions. Variations of the ionic environment in the physiologic ranges observed in urine or within the kidney cause remarkable changes in the physical properties of TH protein. These reversible changes are {{the basis for the}} standard method of TH protein isolation and purification by repeated precipitations in 0. 58 M sodium chloride solution and dialysis against distilled water, originally described by Tamm and Horsfall [1, 2]. Increasing concentrations of TH protein, electrolytes, or hydrogen ions within physiologic limits causes aggregation of TH protein molecules, leading to increased viscosity and gel formation [3, 4]. When these conditions are met within the nephron, <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> are formed. TH protein is the primary constituent of <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts,</b> according to immunochemical [5, 6] and biochemical composition [6] and immunofluorescent microscopy [7, 8].

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to find the effects of cadmium (Cd) on Japanese quail on the role of an animal model in order to {{understand}} the toxicity of Cd in creatures presented, within the environment. Methods: One hundred 30 -day-old male Japanese quails were equally divided into the control group and Cd group. The control group received no Cd while the Cd group was given formula feed comprised of 100 ppm of Cd (CdCl 2, Merck, Germany) for sixty days. The histological and functional alteration in the liver and kidneys and the response of antioxidants were determined. Results: Histological changes in the liver increased the number of kuppfer cells, vacuolar degeneration, and hepatocytes single cell necrosis in the Cd group. The renal histopathological changes were <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> in renal tubules and necrosis and swelling of tubular epithelial cells. The level of aminotransferases (ALT and AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine rose significantly in the Cd group toward the control group (P< 0. 05). The antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH) levels considerably diminished, while lipid peroxidation proliferated substantially in the hepatic and renal tissues of Japanese quails in the CD group (P< 0. 05).

Blood sample was taken from all animals and then the animals were sacrificed under light ether anesthesia on the day after the last injection. Sera were separated and were used to measure the urea and creatinine. Microscopic evaluation of renal injury was performed using a semiquantitative scale to evaluate the degree of tubular necrosis. Results: GM markedly increased serum urea and creatinine, as well as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), glomerular atrophy, hyaline casts formation in tubular lumen, interstitial nephritis and infiltration of inflammatory cells. PTU administration alone caused hyperemia and interstitial nephritis and infiltration of lymphocytic inflammatory cells in cortex but it had no marked effect on glomerular and tubular morphology and function. Co-administration of PTU and GM potentiates the GM-induced nephrotoxicity characterized by diffuse ATN; diffuse <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> formation in lumen and infiltration of inflammatory cell in kidney tissues. Conclusion: Our data indicate that PTU potentiates GM-induced nephrotoxicity. The underlying mechanism(s) via which PTU potentiates GM renal toxicity remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Erythropoietin {{which is}} a {{cytokine}} {{has been known for}} a long time as a hematopoietic hormone. Its effectiveness mechanism is to reduce apoptosis in cells making erythroblast in bone marrow. Its artificial form is available, too. The hormone is used to improve anemia in patients with renal failure. With regard to high rate of renal patients, high cost of renal treatment with erythropoietin, and unavailability of the drug versus easy availability of nandrolone even as an OTC combination in drugstores, we decided to study the coincident effects of both drugs for using nandrolone in place of erythropoietin in case of obtaining suitable results. For this purpose 24 Vistar male rats with weight of 200 - 250 gram were divided randomly in to four groups, each group consisted of 6 rats: the first group was Sham (6 Vistar male rats), the second one was control group in which vascular pedicles were blocked, the third group received 500 IU/kg peritoneally every week, two weeks before ischemia via injection, the fourth group received 3 mg/kg nandrolone decanoate intramuscularly and 500 IU/kg peritoneally every week, two weeks before ischemia. The data were reported as mean+SEM. ANOVA statistical method was used for data analysis and Tokay comparative tests was used to compare the difference among groups. The rate of p< 0. 05 has been considered as a meaningful level among groups. The obtained results demonstrated that erythropoietin had a positive effect on renal function by itself and administration of the drug without nandrolone could decrease and improve degeneration of tubule cells, decrease the <b>hyaline</b> <b>cast</b> and decrease the necrosis of tubule cells.

Hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone did not themselves induce cylindruria but augmented that provoked by acidifying agents. It was shown by the indirect immunofluorescence method that the casts were composed of uromucoid (Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein), which is always present in the urine, usually in solution, and originates predominantly from the tubule cells of the ascending limb of Henle's loop. The urinary excretion of Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein was not increased after the {{administration of}} ethacrynic acid. This mucoprotein is precipitated and forms aggregates when the concentration of electrolytes increases and when the pH of the urine declines. The casts that appear in the urine after strenuous physical exertion are of essentially the same composition.

Cylindruria occurring during diuretic therapy and physical exertion is of no pathological significance, and the diagnostic value of byaline casts is very much limited if their exact composition cannot be determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} {{biomarkers}} of gentamycin- (GM-) induced kidney injury {{have been studied}} by using simple and routine methods and also assessed the efficacy and utility of these routine biomarkers in early diagnosis. Eighty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: three experimental groups treated with different GM dosages (4, 20, and 100 [*]mg·kg− 1) and a control group. The experimental groups were given intramuscular GM injections once daily for 14 days, and the control group was given intramuscular sterile water. Blood and urine samples were collected on treatment days 1, 3, 7, and 14 to test for total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), uric acid (UA), pH, specific gravity (SG), proteins (PRO), and cells in urinary sediment. Histopathology and kidney coefficient were performed on excised kidney specimens. The result indicated that serum CRE, BUN, and TP, urine PRO, and urinary <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> and low-transitional epithelium showed an immediate and highly sensitive response to kidney injury, and the combined diagnosis with the above methods {{could be used in}} early diagnosis. Particularly, the process of the test was simple and quick, no special equipment, so it is more suit for primary medical institution...|$|R
40|$|Mice orally {{infected}} with enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7 {{were used to}} evaluate the activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and the synthetic peptide LFchimera. Groups of BALB/c mice inoculated intragastrically with EHEC O 157 :H 7 showed chronic intestinal infection with the pathogen that persisted over 6 days and resulted in a high mortality rate (90 %). LFchimera and kanamycin significantly decreased (40 %) this mortality rate (P = 0. 028). On the other hand, although mice administered with bLF showed an important reduction in mortality (50 %), this was not statistically significant (P = 0. 070). In infected and untreated mice, severe tubular necrosis, glomerular lesions, and moderate intratubular <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> were found in the kidney. However, in the bLF and LFchimera groups we found a reduction in the damage and a substantial decrease in the bacterial concentration excreted in feces 48 h after infection. Furthermore, sepsis caused by EHEC was reduced by the treatments, evidenced by the fact that bacteria were not detected in the kidney or liver 72 h after infection. The results suggest the bLF and LFchimera could have potential as therapeutics in EHEC infections...|$|R
40|$|Myeloma cast {{nephropathy}} is an obstructing {{disorder of}} renal tubules, caused by precipitation of Bence Jones proteins. Myeloma-like cast nephropathy (MLCN) {{has been reported}} in the literature to occur in various primary renal and nonrenal diseases. We present a series of three rare cases of cast nephropathy, two of which are HIV patients, and the third patient is receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, in all three patients plasma cell dyscrasia has been ruled out. A 30 -year-old male was admitted to the hospital with facial cellulitis. The second patient is a 31 -year-old male who presented with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The third patient was treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for carcinoma. First two cases revealed foci of diffuse tubular dilatation containing <b>hyaline</b> <b>casts</b> and interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, in addition to globally sclerotic glomeruli with ultrastructural foot process fusion and mesangium expansion. The third case showed acute tubular injury and cast formation of irregular casts composed of amorphous or granular material of low density admixed with scattered high electron-dense globules. Myeloma-like cast nephropathy and true myeloma cast nephropathy pose similar destructive effects on renal parenchyma. This new pattern of HIV-related nephropathy should be considered in HIV patients with MLCN, once monoclonal gammopathy is ruled out...|$|R
