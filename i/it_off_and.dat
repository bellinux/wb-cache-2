5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to stop herself, although she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam was {{recorded}} at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The band {{began work on}} the album following the 2004 Vote for Change tour in November 2004, and again employed producer Adam Kasper, who worked with them in predecessor Riot Act. The recording sessions started in February 2005, and worked on <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> on throughout the year, with the sessions being interrupted {{toward the end of}} the year when the band toured North America and South America. The album was completed in early 2006. Bassist Jeff Ament attributed the length of time recording to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder having a child and the band touring in the middle of recording. The album was mixed by Kasper at Studio X.|$|E

5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him to take <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, {{so that he would}} have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed.

He went on to start five of the last six games of the season for the Panthers. Playing in 16 games with five starts, Munnerlyn recorded 47 tackles and one forced fumble, tied for second on the team with three interceptions (including one returned for a touchdown) and ranked first with 10 passes defensed, contributing to a Panthers defense that ranked seventh in the NFL in average yards per play.

5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The story {{centers on}} the {{kidnapping}} of David Tapp by The Jigsaw Killer. During the first Saw film, Tapp witnessed his longtime friend and partner, Detective Steven Sing, fall victim to one of Jigsaw's traps. This left Tapp mentally unstable and he was soon discharged from the police force. Later, Tapp {{was shot in the}} chest by Zep Hindle after chasing him in pursuit of Jigsaw. Jigsaw had Tapp healed and concealed a key in his chest. Tapp was then placed in an abandoned insane asylum. Tapp wakes up in a bathroom with the Reverse Bear Trap on him. He quickly pulls <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> ventures into the rest of the asylum. He is led to a medical wing by another victim of Jigsaw, only to be betrayed by the man. Tapp learns that he is being hunted by other victims in the asylum who need the key inside his chest to escape their own games. In the medical wing, Jigsaw informs Tapp that there is a woman trapped in the area who needs Tapp's help to survive. He quickly deciphers that it is Amanda Young, whom Tapp interviewed after she survived her first test. He saves Amanda, and she follows Tapp until a mysterious figure called Pighead captures her to fake her escape; she is actually Jigsaw's secret apprentice.|$|E

25|$|The main predators {{of fishing}} spiders are birds and snakes. Dragonflies {{have also been}} {{observed}} catching young spiders.

The larvae of the wasp hatch and proceed to eat the spider from the inside out. One escape technique the spiders use is to disappear beneath the surface tension of the water. However, some wasps counter the disappearing trick by going into the water to sting the spider and drag {{it out of the}} water.|$|E
