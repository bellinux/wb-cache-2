For rural electrifications, researches are focused on hybrid power system which provides sustainable power. The variable voltage and frequency of the self excited induction generator (SEIG) is rectified through Vienna rectifier (three switches) to the required D. C voltage level and fed to common <b>D.</b> <b>C</b> <b>bus.</b> The variable output voltage of PV module is controlled by DC/DC converter using proposed fuzzy logic controller and fed to common <b>D.</b> <b>C</b> <b>bus.</b> The DC bus collects the total power from the wind and photovoltaic system and used {{to charge the battery}} as well as to supply the A. C loads through inverter. A dynamic mathematical model and MATLAB simulations for the entire scheme is presented. Results from the simulations and experimental tests bring out the suitability of the proposed hybrid scheme in remote areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{performance}} of three level inverters {{depends on the}} PWM technique. The three level space vector PWM (SVPWM) has improved performance {{in terms of the}} THD and the <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>bus</b> mid point voltage balance compared to three level sine triangle PWM (SPWM). The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the importance of the space vectors, the influence of their placement in the switching sequence on the {{performance of}} the PWM techniques and address the basic issue of why the SVPWM has superior performance over SPWM technique. Such a basic understanding will help in designing optimal PWM with desired performance. The study has shown that the superior performance of SVPWM is because ofthe placement of the small space vectors as the beginning and ending vectors in each sequence, with equal dwell times. The simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical observations. The SVPWM is implemented on a general purpose DSP based digital controller and applied to constant v/f drive...|$|E
40|$|Reactive power (vars) is {{required}} to maintain the voltage to deliver active power through transmission lines. Generator and other loads require reactive power to convert the flow of electrons into useful work. When {{there is not enough}} reactive power, the voltage sags down and {{it is not possible to}} push the power demanded by loads through the lines. Thus reactive power is injected using the compensating device STATCOM. The Paper deals on static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) which is connected to the parallel operated isolated synchronous generators to drive a 3 -phase load. These generators are driven by constant prime mover like diesel engine,bio-mass,gasoline,steam turbine etc. Three single phase IGBT based Voltage source converter (VSC) along with 3 -single phase transformers and self supported <b>D.</b> <b>C</b> <b>bus</b> is used as a voltage controller. The project deals with controlling a STATCOM using non-linear techniques that involves hysteresis current control and Park’s transformation. The voltage controller of parallel operated generators for feeding 3 -phase loads driven by constant speed prime mover like Hydraulic turbine governor model helps in satisfactory operation under varying loads and in load balancing. If the line current is less than the expected, the compensating current generated by STATCOM is taken by loads...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the synchronized PWM techniques based on space vector approach for three level voltage source inverters. The {{objective is to}} improve the output waveform of the inverters used in high power applications, where the switching frequency is very low. This is achieved by maintaining the synchronization and half wave symmetry, quarter wave symmetry, three-phase symmetry in the PWM waveforms. The principles of achieving synchronization and symmetries are presented. The proposed algorithm is implemented on TMS 320 F 240 based digital controller and applied to V/f drive. The experimental waveforms of the inverter output voltage and motor no load current for different operating conditions of the drive are presented. The $V_{WTHD}$ of the line voltage and $I_{THD}$ of the no load current of the motor are computed from the experimental data. The performance measure in terms of the $V_{WTHD}$ of the line voltage is computed for the entire operating region of the drive for the proposed algorithm and the synchronized SPWM technique. The comparative results show that the proposed method has improved THD over SPWM method. Another significant feature of the proposed algorithm is that the symmetry and synchronization leads to self-balancing of the <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>bus</b> capacitor voltages...|$|E

The influence of smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> and pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> discharge power on films thickness, crystallinity, surface morphology, photocatalytic activity (methylene blue degradation) and hydrophilic activity were studied. At pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> sputtering, plasma generator has been used to provide the asymmetric pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> bias of the target at 100 kHz and pulsed off-time 4016 ns. The structures of the films at 100 nm and 300 nm thick showed nano-grain size structure. The pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode deposition exhibited a considerably lower surface roughness, but higher grain size compared to the films deposited with the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode. At film thickness about 300 nm, the XRD peaks indicated that the dominant structure was anatase for which the preferred orientation was in (101) plane. It did not show any definite change of phase between the films deposited in the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode and the film deposited in the pulse <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode. For the photocatalytic activity, it was clearly seen that the films deposited by smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode showed a higher photocatalytic activity.

40|$|Abstract. On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions. Moreover, it is well-known, and not difficult to show, that it is even an algebra and a lattice (see, e. g., [2, III. 2]). While an everywhere defined quotient g/f of two <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on a finite-dimensional Banach space is always <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> (cf.
