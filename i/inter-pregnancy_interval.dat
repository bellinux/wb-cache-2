40|$|Comments on an article, Pre-conception <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> {{and risk}} of {{schizophrenia}} by L. Gunawardana et al. (2011). The short report by Gunawardana et al. succinctly argues that a short <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> a proxy for fetal under nutrition and stress, increases the offspring’s risk of later schizophrenia. The authors hint at a causal relationship. This is compelling because it suggests that an affordable public health intervention via the promotion of dietary supplements in the postpartum period may later reduce schizophrenia prevalence. Although the authors compare pre- and post-birth intervals and adjust {{for a number of}} confounders, their findings may still relate to bias and residual confounding. First, the timing of schizophrenia measurement may distort the prevalence and gender ratio of schizophrenia. This is important because a short <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is known to favour male offspring. Epidemiological designs will only drive hypotheses so far in examining the causal relationship between prenatal micronutrient depletion and later psychopathology. That said, there would be scientific value in examining cohorts pre- and post-introduction of public health recommendations of periconceptional folic acid vitamin supplementation. Introducing postnatal vitamin supplementation to reduce schizophrenia prevalence is an enticing idea; however, it would be important to use a variety of research designs to establish or exclude causality before implementing any change in public health policy.

It is one of the important factors which determine the readiness with which the newborn baby adjusts to its surrounding. Many maternal socio-biological factors influence birth weight. Objective: To determine maternal socio-biological factors influencing birth weight of newborn. Methodology: Hospital based cross- sectional study undertaken in Obstetrics and Gynaecology ward of Nehru hospital, Gorakhpur. The study period extended from July 2011 to August 2012. The study subject included recently delivered mothers and data was collected on semi-structured interview schedule to know various socio-biological variables such as mother’s age, parity, <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> etc, influencing the low birth weight of newborn. Chi-Square test was applied to observe the significance of association.   Results: The overall proportion of low birth weight baby came out to be 32. 06 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Miscarriages can be {{considered}} one of the most frequent problems that occur during pregnancy in humans. The frequency of cases among clinical pregnancies is about 12 - 15 %. The determinants of the majority of miscarriages that occur are not wholly understood, and many putative risk factors remain controversial. The objective of this study was to explore the association of miscarriages with various socio-demographic and anamnestic factors in the Ukrainian population up to 1999. METHODS. In a case-control study nested in a cross-sectional survey, miscarriage was considered the outcome. The study data included 14 297 pregnancies of women of reproductive age (15 - 44 years old) who participated in the 1999 Ukraine Reproductive Health Survey. Different socio-demographic and anamnestic factors were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS. After adjustment for confounding, the following factors were independently associated with increased risk of having miscarriage at the p-level less than 0. 05 : year of the pregnancy after 1997 (AOR 1. 72 95 % CI 1, 15 – 2, 57), central regions of Ukraine (AOR 1, 37 95 % CI 1, 00 – 1, 88), high maternal age at first sexual intercourse (AOR 1, 41 95 % CI 1, 03 – 1, 92), ignorance of education level of the first sexual partner (AOR 2, 29 95 % CI 1, 50 – 3, 50), higher number of previous pregnancies (AOR 4, 52 95 % CI 1, 70 – 12, 02), <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> 4 - 6 years (AOR 1, 72 95 % CI 1, 14 – 2, 59), and problems with getting pregnant (AOR 3, 13 95 % CI 2, 55 – 3, 84). Russian ethnicity (AOR 0, 80 95 % CI 0, 66 – 0, 97), being non-religious (AOR 0, 76 95 % CI 0, 58 – 0, 99), <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> 15 – 18 months (AOR 0, 60 95 % CI 0, 36 – 0, 99) were associated with reduced risk of miscarriages. CONCLUSIONS. The results confirm that the higher <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and number of pregnancies, which can be related to older maternal age, are factors associated with miscarriages. The lower risk of miscarriages before 1997 can be explained by problems with recalling past events in the life. Findings of increased risk associated with high maternal age at first sexual intercourse and ignorance of the first sexual partner’s level of education are noteworthy and deserve consideration in further studies with other study populations...|$|E

Non-attenders {{were more likely to}} be teenagers, unmarried, in unions of very short duration, smokers and women who felt that friends and relatives were not supportive. Multigravid non-attenders often had short <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> and included women who had experienced a post neonatal death. They were often drawn from deprived environments (lack of sanitation, water supplies). Late attenders shared features common to non-attenders (teenagers, unmarried, multigravid). Many however were self employed and did not fit the depressed profile of the non-attender. Most multigravidae who attended late had had previously uneventful pregnancies, including this one. Early attenders had little in common with non-attenders or late attenders. They were older, many had a secondary or tertiary education, were married and were generally middle class women. The group however included high risk multigravidae who had previous pregnancy complications or bad outcomes. Programmes aimed at reaching non-attenders must focus on the wider social and economic needs of these women and must give them a sense of their own power to effect change in their lives. Reaching the late attender will be more difficult and may be unnecessary with the possible exception of the teenager.

40|$|AbstractAbstractAbstractAbstract Abstract Spacing the <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> to {{more than}} two years reduces {{maternal}} and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Modern contraceptive use can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality by contributing to birth spacing and reducing the total fertility rate. This study is designed to understand the factors associated with appropriate birth spacing and the barriers to modern contraceptive use in Leogane, Haiti. A cross sectional survey of 552 reproductive age women in Leogane proper was performed from June to July of 2011. Univariate, multivariate, and logisitic regressions were used to analyze the data. The results demonstrate the importance of education, employment status, contraceptive use and stable relationships in influencing appropriate birth spacing. Women who spaced their births tended to have less complications compared to women who did not, however this difference was not statistically significant. Barriers to contraceptive use were cultural factors such as religion, and low socioeconomic status. However, contraceptive use was positively influenced by education and partner acceptance of contraceptives. These findings indicate that family programs focused on educating women and their partners on the benefits of contraception and birth spacing would be successful in Leogane, Haiti. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low {{birth weight}} (LBW) is an {{important}} risk factor for childhood morbidity and mortality, consequently an important public health concern. Aim: This study aims to identify significant socio-economic and nutritional determinants associated with LBW in India. Materials and Methods: Data from 2005 to 2006 National Family Health Survey- 3 (NFHS- 3) of India was analyzed. A total of 20, 946 women (15 - 49 years) who gave birth at least once 5 years preceding the NFHS- 3 were included in this study. Infant's LBW (< 2500 grams) as outcome variable was examined in association with all independent predictors as infant's sex, maternal household wealth status, caste, age, education, body mass index (BMI), stature, anemia level, parity, <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> antenatal care received, and living place. Results: Almost 20 % of the infants were born with LBW. Mother's low education level, BMI < 18. 5, short stature (height < 145 centimeters) and lack of antenatal visits (< 4 visits) were significant predictors of LBW.

40|$|Rwanda {{has so far}} {{paid little}} {{attention}} to 'healthy' intervals between pregnancies awareness programs on family planning and maternal and child health. Results of this thesis shed some light on the contribution of IPI and the type of previous pregnancy outcome on fetal survival, neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity in Rwanda. By using the combined effect of IPI and the type of previous pregnancy outcome instead of Inter-Birth Interval (IBI), it became clear that analysis using IBI leave behind possible fetal deaths that are more likely to happen in between births and that do play a role in affecting the reproductive health of the mother. We posit that women will improve their reproductive health status and avoid the risk of a fetal death trap if they wait at least two years after the previous fetal death. This finding relates to the findings from other developing countries such as Bangladesh (in opposite to findings from developed countries), and might be related to the absence of post-abortion care. Results from other studies give no assurance about what exactly is a healthy interval. In a bid to avoid methodological flaw, studies on infant mortality should avoid selectivity bias by concomitantly considering fetal survival. Yet, we found little evidence for simultaneous effects of short IPI’s fetal and neonatal mortality. The causes for neonatal mortality are not moderated by the <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> while those for fetal loss are. Short IPIs are not associated with maternal morbidity, yet primigravida and women with long IPIs showed increased risks of third trimester bleeding, premature rupture of membrane and lower limb edema. Primigravida showed adverse outcomes throughout this study, implying that programs geared to reduce maternal death and neonatal mortality should consider primigravida with particular attention. After a pregnancy loss, a pregnancy interval longer than six months must be observed to prevent recurrence. Also women with very long IPI (<= 5 years) have consistently shown increased risks of fetal loss, neonatal death and maternal morbidity. Our findings contribute to the debate whether older age of the mother might be hiding behind the effect of very long interval length. We found no negative effects of older age, and a remaining strong effect of long <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> which again supports the physiological regression hypothesis. Policy wise, avoiding short IPIs can be achieved through the use of post-partum contraception while long IPIs remain problematic to avoid, given that a desired pregnancy may be precluded by sub-fertility, availability of a partner, economic issues or illness. In the context of poor countries like Rwanda, a full reproductive health package is necessary and pregnancy management strategies should be encouraged through family planning for spacing pregnancies, and the promotion of health seeking behavior in the form ante- and post-natal care. Hospital staff should encourage post-abortion medication, and health centers in remote areas of the country should be less reluctant in transferring pregnant women and not wait until their situation becomes critical, rather they should provide a timely benefit of emergency obstetrical care...|$|E

They often desire to conceive again with minimal delay. Methods: A study was conducted on 252, 2 nd gravida women with history of previous spontaneous abortion. Based on their IPI women were divided into 5 groups. Results: Most of the pregnancy complications like threatened miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, placental abruption, caesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) were maximum in those who conceived after 24 months and least in those who conceived between 6 - 12 months. But intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR) was more in early conception group. Pregnancy outcome was also good in those who conceived within 6 months.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2004, mothers filled in questionnaires on their newborn children {{on behalf of the}} Amsterdam-Born Children and their Development study (ABCD study). Data from 5, 276 liveborn children in this cohort were used to calculate the prevalence rates of congenital anomalies in Amsterdam. These were compared with expected prevalence rates based on Eurocat data for the Northern region of the Netherlands during the years 2000 - 2005.

METHODS: A cohort study was performed with 145 women receiving maternity care {{at a hospital in}} Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, aged 19 to 45 years, between weeks 38 and 42 of pregnancy. The patients were evaluated at one month, three months, and six months after delivery. Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare groups, as indicated; correlations were assessed with Pearson's and Spearman's tests, as indicated; to identify and evaluate confounders independently associated with total weight loss, a multivariate linear regression analysis was performed and statistical significance was set at p&# 8804; 0. 05. RESULTS: There was a significant positive association between total weight gain - and a negative association with physical exercise during pregnancy - with total weight loss. Higher parity, <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> calorie intake, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), weight gain related to pre-pregnancy BMI, presence and severity of depression, and lack of exclusive breastfeeding were directly associated with lower weight loss.

CONCLUSION: In the present study, lower weight retention in the postpartum period was associated with higher educational attainment and with being married. Normal or below-normal pre-pregnancy BMI, physical activity and adequate weight gain during pregnancy, lower parity, exclusive breastfeeding for a longer period, appropriate or low calorie intake, and absence of depression were also determinants of reduced weight retention...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. To {{determine}} whether the risk of preeclampsia in multiparous women with a previous normal pregnancy is related to changing paternity or to prolonged birth interval, a retrospective study was conducted at the Lyell McEwin Health Service (University of Adelaide). Methods. The study included all multiparous women known to the hospital because of their preceding 1 st delivery in the same hospital followed by their 2 nd and/or 3 rd ongoing pregnancy resulting in a delivery in the period 2001 - 2003. Case records were analyzed for birth interval, pregnancy interval, paternity and recognized risk factors such as booking weight and smoking. For the analysis both the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) definition and the more recently introduced classification by the Australian Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ASSHP) were used. Results. In the 656 women in this study cohort, 148 (26. 2 %) women had a different partner in their 2 nd and/or 3 rd ongoing pregnancy. Using the ISSHP definition for preeclampsia, changing partners had an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 304 (95 % CI 0. 43 - 3. 99); using ASSHP criteria an OR of 1. 556 (95 % CI 0. 6506 - 3721); {{and looking at the}} combined group of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders an OR of 1. 99 (95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 89). A longer birth interval if anything was associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia (non-significant), whatever definition was used. Also the <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> did not show a consistent relation with the risk for developing a hypertensive complication. Conclusions. The results of this study on risk factors for preeclampsia in multiparous women appear to be in line with the primipaternity hypothesis, but are in direct contrast with the so-called birth interval hypothesis.

Pregnancy places a burden on maternal micronutrient reserves and, if a new conception occurs before these reserves are sufficiently re-stored, growth and development of the conceptus may be compromised. Pregnancies accomplished shortly after the preceding delivery, in addition, are more likely than others to be unintended (5), which decreases the probability that periconceptional folic acid (or multivitamin) supplements were used. As Villamor et al. note, the risk of orofacial clefts has been found to depend on periconceptional intake of folate and other micronutrients. The authors mention that confirmation of their observa-tion in other study populations is required, and we agree. We would, however, suggest an adjustment of the categorization of interpregnancy interval, because it is possible that the one used (< 12, 12 – 23, 24 – 35, 36 – 47, 48 months) was too broad to reveal any increased risks after short interpreg-nancy intervals. As a first move, Villamor et al. (1) might want to repeat their analyses with a more fine-tuned classi-fication of short interpregnancy intervals (e. g., categories spanning no more than 3 months). Because short interpregnancy intervals are—at least in principle—avoidable, any risks linked to them should not remain unnecessarily concealed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the association between}} social inequalities and low birth weight (LBW) (occurring in both pre- and full-term births) in Germany {{can be explained by}} several potentially confounding factors. These include maternal age, occupational status, marital status, nationality, employment status, smoking, prenatal care, psychosocial stress, obesity, short stature, short <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> chronic conditions, and several obstetrical risk factors such as pregnancy induced hypertension. We also examined how the risk for LBW varies over time within each socioeconomic group. We analyzed routinely collected perinatal data on singletons born in the federal state of Lower Saxony, Germany, in 1990, 1995, and 1999 (n= 182, 444). After adjustment for all potentially confounding factors in multivariate logistic regression models, working class women, unemployed women, single mothers, and women over 39 years of age were at increased risk for pre- and full-term LBW infants. Migrant status was not related to LBW. We examined variations in the risk for LBW over time within groups, using the 1990 birth cohort as the referent group for the 1995 and 1999 birth cohorts. Compared to 1990, in 1999 women aged 19 - 34 years, housewives, unemployed women, women of German nationality and women with partners had higher risks for pre- and full-term LBW infants; the eldest subgroup had lower risks for LBW after adjustment for confounding factors. The factors we examined partly explain the social inequalities in LBW occurring in pre- and full-term infants. The subgroups with higher rates of LBW in 1999 compared to 1990, included women experiencing childbirth in an optimal stage of life or in a privileged social context. Public health policies in Germany should target social inequalities contributing to the aetiology of LBW and to the factors that result in increased LBW rates.

40|$|Maternal {{overweight}} and obesity {{are associated with}} increased risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes, but the mechanisms are unclear. If a change of exposure (i. e., maternal body mass index [BMI]) over time influences risks, this {{would be consistent with}} a causal relationship between maternal BMI and offspring risks. Our objective was to investigate associations between changes in maternal BMI between consecutive pregnancies and risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes in the second offspring born at term. This study was a prospective population-based cohort study that included 526, 435 second-born term (≥ 37 wk) infants of mothers with two consecutive live singleton term births in Sweden between January 1992 and December 2012. We estimated associations between the difference in maternal BMI {{between the first and second}} pregnancy and risks of low Apgar score (0 - 6) at 5 min, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration in the second-born offspring. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for BMI at first pregnancy, maternal height, maternal age at second delivery, smoking, education, mother´s country of birth, <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> and year of second delivery. Analyses were also stratified by BMI (< 25 versus ≥ 25 kg/m 2) in the first pregnancy. Risks of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration increased with inter-pregnancy weight gain. Compared with offspring of mothers with stable weight (BMI change of - 1 to < 1 kg/m 2), the adjusted OR for a low Apgar score in the offspring of mothers with a BMI change of 4 kg/m 2 or more was 1. 33 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 58). The corresponding risks for neonatal seizures and meconium aspiration were 1. 42 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 2. 02) and 1. 78 (95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 68), respectively. The increased risk of neonatal seizures related to weight gain appeared to be restricted to mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m 2 in the first pregnancy. A study limitation was the lack of data on the effects of obstetric interventions and neonatal resuscitation efforts. Risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes increased with maternal weight gain between pregnancies. Preventing weight gain before and in between pregnancies may improve neonatal health...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} part of the supplement: Preconception interventionsINTRODUCTION: There is {{increasingly}} a double burden of under-nutrition and obesity in women of reproductive age. Preconception underweight or overweight, short stature and micronutrient deficiencies all contribute to excess maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted to ascertain the possible impact of preconception care for adolescents, women and couples of reproductive age on maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) outcomes. A comprehensive strategy was used to search electronic reference libraries, and both observational and clinical controlled trials were included. Cross-referencing and a separate search strategy for each preconception risk and intervention ensured wider study capture. RESULTS: Maternal pre-pregnancy weight is a significant factor in the preconception period with underweight contributing to a 32 % higher risk of preterm birth, and obesity more than doubling the risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes. Overweight {{women are more likely to}} undergo a Cesarean delivery, and their newborns have higher chances of being born with a neural tube or congenital heart defect. Among nutrition-specific interventions, preconception folic acid supplementation has the strongest evidence of effect, preventing 69 % of recurrent neural tube defects. Multiple micronutrient supplementation shows promise to reduce the rates of congenital anomalies and risk of preeclampsia. Although over 40 % of women worldwide are anemic in the preconception period, only one study has shown a risk for low birth weight. CONCLUSION: All women, but especially those who become pregnant in adolescence or have closely-spaced pregnancies (<b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> less than six months), require nutritional assessment and appropriate intervention in the preconception period with an emphasis on optimizing maternal body mass index and micronutrient reserves. Increasing coverage of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive strategies (such as food fortification; integration of nutrition initiatives with other maternal and child health interventions; and community based platforms) is necessary among adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. The effectiveness of interventions will need to be simultaneously monitored, and form the basis for the development of improved delivery strategies and new nutritional interventions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preterm birth, {{the birth}} of an infant prior to 37 {{completed}} weeks of gestation, {{is the leading cause}} of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Preterm infants are at greater risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. Despite significant research in developed countries, little is known about the causes of preterm birth in many developing countries, especially China. This study investigates the association between sciodemographic data, obstetric risk factor, and preterm birth in five Maternal and Child Health hospitals in Beijing, China. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A case-control study was conducted on 1391 women with preterm birth (case group) and 1391 women with term delivery (control group), who were interviewed within 48 hours of delivery. Sixteen potential factors were investigated and statistical analysis was performed by univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis. Univariate analysis showed that 14 of the 16 factors were associated with preterm birth. <b>Inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and inherited diseases were not risk factors. Logistic regression analysis showed that obesity (odds ratio (OR)  =  3. 030, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 166 - 7. 869), stressful life events (OR =  5. 535, 95 %CI 2. 315 - 13. 231), sexual activity (OR =  1. 674, 95 %CI 1. 279 - 2. 191), placenta previa (OR 13. 577, 95 %CI 2. 563 - 71. 912), gestational diabetes mellitus (OR =  3. 441, 95 %CI 1. 694 - 6. 991), hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (OR =  6. 034, 95 %CI =  3. 401 - 10. 704), history of preterm birth (OR =  20. 888, 95 %CI 2. 519 - 173. 218) and reproductive abnormalities (OR =  3. 049, 95 %CI 1. 010 - 9. 206) were independent risk factors. Women who lived in towns and cities (OR =  0. 603, 95 %CI 0. 430 - 0. 846), had a balanced diet (OR =  0. 533, 95 %CI 0. 421 - 0. 675) and had a record of prenatal care (OR =  0. 261, 95 %CI 0. 134 - 0. 510) were less likely to have preterm birth.

40|$|Background: China {{accounts}} {{for a quarter of}} the total number of induced abortion worldwide. Induced abortion is considered as one of the risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome in subsequent pregnancy. The effects of induced abortion on premature delivery were investigated in both China and western countries, and most of the studies showed that increased risk of preterm birth was associated with increasing number of induced abortion. However, the association between low birth weight (LBW) and multiple induced abortions is still controversial. Objectives: To explore the association between LBW and previous induced abortion history, and to investigate the effects of preterm birth on the association. Methods: This case-control study used data from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Nan Fang Hospital, between December 2011 and June 2012. We recruited 402 LBW (less than 2500 g) infants as our case group and 407 normal weight infants as the control group. Chi-square test and t-test were used for descriptive analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was run to yield odds ratios (OR) of LWB for multiple induced abortion adjusting for sex, birth order, maternal previous diseases and age, antenatal care received, and <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> Mediation effect of preterm status was investigated. Results: We observed a higher proportion of women with multiple induced abortions in LBW group (18. 4 % versus 11. 1 %, p value= 0. 003). Mothers with previous multiple induced abortion were 68. 3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 11. 0 % to 155. 3 %) more likely to have LWB infants, compared with those who did not have induced abortion history or only once. After adjustment also for preterm status, the adjusted OR reduced to 1. 332 (95 % CI: 0. 682 to 2. 602) and the association became non-significant. Mediation test confirmed that preterm status was a mediator factor between multiple induced abortion and LBW. Conclusion: Overall, multiple abortions had an effect on LBW mainly through shortening the gestational duration of infants. Either premature delivery or LBW, the effect of multiple abortions on subsequent pregnancy was confirmed in this study. To reduce the perinatal mortality and morbidity, it is not enough only through postpartum care for preterm birth and LBW. The prevention and intervention strategies are urgently needed for reducing the induced abortion rate. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{residents}} in the Low Country region of South Carolina consist of a predominantly low-income, African American population {{with a history of}} trauma and experiences of racism. Chronic conditions, unintended pregnancies, and adverse birth outcomes are prevalent. Many women experience rapid repeat pregnancies (RRP) due to lack of access to choices in contraceptive methods or lack of education on the dangers of RRP and prevention through contraception. Low Country Healthy Start (LCHS) aims to ensure that perinatal women and adolescents in the service area who enrolled received adequate prenatal and postpartum care, educational and counseling services, and contraceptive methods, including a Depo Provera injection at discharge (D 1) after their index birth in LCHS. Previous research agree that black women, adolescents, low education, mental health, and past trauma are all associated with RRP, and lack adolescents are less likely to retain a form of contraception that requires maintenance and proper usage. AIM: To (1) examine the effect of D 1 and other variables on time to RRP; and to (2) examine the effect of receiving various forms of contraception and their use over time, including the Depo injection (D 2) on time to RRP. METHODS: Clients included in the analysis either delivered a baby while enrolled in LCHS or had complete data on all necessary variables (n= 761). The Cox regression model was fitted to model the effect of receiving different contraceptive methods as well as relevant and statistically significant (α= 0. 05) risk factors on time to RRP. RESULTS: For Aim 1, D 1 resulted in a hazard rate about 46 % lower than that of a non-D 1 (unadjusted HR = 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 36 - 0. 83; adjusted HR = 0. 52, 95 % CI: 0. 34 - 0. 8). However, after adjusting for other variables (age, unplanned index pregnancy, physical abuse during pregnancy, and postpartum depression score) and the time-varying effect of D 1, D 1 resulted in a HR of 29. 63 (β = 3. 39, 95 % CI: 6. 049 - 145. 141), that decreased at a natural log function of time (HR = 0. 22, β = - 1. 53, 95 % CI: 0. 12 - 0. 40). For Aim 2, D 2 resulted in a lower hazard rate than non-D 2 (unadjusted HR = 0. 17, 95 % CI: 0. 09 - 0. 32; adjusted HR = 0. 16, 95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 31). Adjusting all variables in Aim 2, including D 2, D 1 resulted in a statistically insignificant lower HR of 0. 88 (p = 0. 544, 95 % CI: 0. 57 - 1. 34). There was no significant interaction between D 1 and D 2 or between D 1 and any other contraceptive type. LARC showed a highly protective but not statistically significant effect against RRP (adjusted HR = 0. 05, p = 0. 093, 95 % CI: 0. 002 - 2. 26), but that protective effect decreased multiplicatively by about. 25 with each passing month (HR = 1. 25, p = 0. 029, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 53). DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the Depo injection, although important to receive at discharge, must be continued consistently to have a significant protective effect in preventing a RRP. LARC methods in general are strong protective factors. Being issued a contraceptive method that required adherence predicted a shorter <b>inter-pregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (IPI), but this reflects the client’s adherence to the contraceptive method, and not its biological effectiveness. Future research should examine the effect of receiving the Depo injection at discharge on the continuation of different contraceptive methods, as well as the effect of counseling and educational services on contraceptive use and time to RRP...|$|E
