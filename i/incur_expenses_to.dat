40|$|This paper studies a {{conditional}} {{block grant}} that Dutch municipalities receive for welfare-to-work programs. Many municipalities {{do not fully}} use this grant, although programs are beneficial for them. We argue that municipalities <b>incur</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> use the grant. If these costs are substantial, then it is optimal not to fully use the grant. Based on municipality-specific data on grants and actual expenditures, we estimate that municipalities have to add about 90 cents from their own resources to spend 1 euro of the grant. As a result, the conditional block grant is de facto a closed-ended matching grant...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to review}} concepts, theories, and {{research}} reports related to domestic violence between spouses in Thailand, especially its meanings, types, causes, and effects. It is a documentary research, which concludes descriptive analysis {{to obtain a}} body of knowledge using a holistic approach. The outcomes of the research reveal that domestic violence between spouses in Thailand is patterns and ways that individuals use force to hurt others ’ health, physically, mentally, and sexually. They force, threaten, injure, detain, delay, molest, ignore, and invade personal rights and freedoms. Domestic violence can be classified into self-violence, violence between individuals, and violence between groups. It can also be classified into physical, mental, and sexual violence. Important causes of domestic violence derive from a belief that men have power to dominate their families, and other causes include environments that contribute to violence, childhood experiences, conflict, stress, and lack of time with each other. These can result in injury, lessons instilled in children, violence absorbed by children, unhappy families, runaway children, and divorces. In addition, domestic violence between spouses can be chaotic and disturbing for the community, and <b>incur</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> the government in looking after victims, hiring personnel, and campaigning to terminate and prevent the problem. Thus, parents and guardians must realize and give importance to avoidance of domestic violence. Individuals and organizations concerned must cooperate i...|$|E

This savings would be reduced by any <b>expenses</b> <b>incurred</b> <b>to</b> establish the FLP (attorney and accountant fees) and also by the <b>expenses</b> <b>incurred</b> <b>to</b> hire a qualified appraiser to determine appropriate discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Information {{technology}} {{can no longer}} viewed as a strictly business supportive mechanism <b>incurring</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> an organization. With {{the advent of the}} global economy concept, it is rather thought to be the vehicle that will carry the business into the future. The paradox lies in determining what makes technology sense in conjunction with business sense. The purpose of developing an integrated IT research methodology is to properly guide the business into the future using right technology, right strategy and right organizational behavior. The proposed methodology is divided into three sub-methodologies, e. g., mapping technology to business functions, researching new technology and measuring IT effectiveness. Implementation of these sub-methodologies in an integrated way ensures a standard uniform research approach for the evaluation and adoption of new technology as well as the alignment of technology with the business vision. Additionally, it favors the gradual transformation of IT infrastructure and competency that prepares the organization for the future, resulting in a more predictable cost and value proposition for technology...|$|R
