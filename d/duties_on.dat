40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the tax incidence {{of the changes in}} the excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes rates since the year 2003 to 2006 in the Czech Republic. The shift in the tax burden is quantified on the basis of observations of the consumer prices of selected commodities subjected to the excise duties in periods of the changes in the excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes rates in the Czech Republic. The factors influencing the shifts and impacts of increased tax burden caused by excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes rate increase in the Czech Republic are identified in this contribution. The results of the contribution enable to set synthetic conclusions and recommendation for the future development of excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> cigarettes rates and tax policy in the Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco {{products}} in the Czech Republic since 1993 {{up to the present}} time, especially the development of rates and revenues. Excise <b>duty</b> is imposed <b>on</b> tobacco products in the Czech Republic and also in the other European Union countries. Harmonisation efforts in the European Union and also fiscal need of Czech Republic cause frequent changes in tobacco excise duty rates, which conduces not only to change of tax collection, but can also bring some other related effects. In the theoretical part I first characterize the tax theory with a detailed focus <b>on</b> excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products. Subsequently I define the meaning of excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products, the principles and the mechanisms of the tax collection. In the practical part of the thesis I aim at analyse the evolution of the legal framework that affects excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products and significantly affects the thesis in other sections. Further, I analyse the relationship between the rate of excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products and tax collection and find out that the higher rate of excise duty not always led to higher tax yields. Finally I assess the effectiveness of the increase of excise <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products {{and its impact on the}} consumption of tobacco products, illegal market and the public budgets...|$|R

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new <b>duties</b> <b>on</b> various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new <b>duties</b> <b>on</b> various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
