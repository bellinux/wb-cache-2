5000|$|Because {{of their}} {{potential}} for abuse, sweepstakes are heavily regulated in many countries. The U.S., Canada, and individual U.S. states all have laws covering sweepstakes, {{so that there are}} special rules depending on where the entrant lives. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission exercises some authority over sweepstakes promotion and sweepstakes scams in the United States. Notably, sweepstakes in Canada, Australia and several European countries require entrants to solve an (elementary school level) mathematical puzzle or answer a (fairly simple) knowledge question or solve a (trivial) fill-in-the-blanks <b>guessing</b> <b>competition,</b> making it (in theory at least) a contest of skill, in order to overcome requirements that would classify sweepstakes as a form of gambling under their country's legal definition. There are similar laws in Brazil, usually requiring an answer to an easy [...] "giveaway" [...] question.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from a brief {{resignation}} {{to train}} as a Benihana chef in Hawaii and being effectively laid {{off for a}} few months after Daniel Shaw's bomb destroyed the store, Morgan has been employed by the Burbank Buy More since 2003. Throughout the first two seasons, Morgan is frequently involved in antics in the store, often including misuse of store equipment: he has destroyed a store display computer by picking up a virus when surfing for porn, he has become the store champ of a TV show <b>guessing</b> <b>competition</b> on the video wall and has used the storage cage for a Thunderdome match to determine the new assistant store manager. Chuck has told Morgan he's not allowed access to Chuck's advanced demos of new games without [...] "adult supervision." [...] Morgan has also been known to [...] "borrow" [...] Buy More's DVDs off the shelf, copy them, and then re-shrinkwrap them before returning them. [...] He has also nearly gotten in trouble for sexual harassment and has skipped work to visit an arcade.|$|E
50|$|By {{the year}} 2004, aged 16, A Chord had {{composed}} around 50-60 songs {{and won a}} songwriting <b>competition.</b> He attended <b>Guess</b> Guess <b>Guess</b> during the <b>competition</b> period, and was favourably received by the audience. The prize was a contract with HIM International Music, but A Chord did not take up the offer of the contract and instead, went to play underground music with his band, SEA-LEVEL (海平面).|$|R
500|$|A {{meeting was}} held over the Easter weekend in 1928 by the Cinque Ports Flying Club. Pleasure flights were given for {{a cost of}} 5/-. An unverified report stated that one person was {{dissatisfied}} with two circuits of the airfield. The pilot {{is said to have}} offered to take him up again, which was accepted. On this second flight various aerobatics were flown and the hapless passenger was said to have been left incapable of expressing himself coherently. Among the pilots attending were Geoffrey de Havilland and his son. Other activities included some air racing and a <b>guess</b> the altitude <b>competition.</b> In May a Notice to Airmen said that the scheme for aircraft reporting that they were crossing the Channel was being extended. Lympne was to remain the reporting place on the English side but, in Belgium and France, the Ostend and St Inglevert airfields were joined by semaphore stations at Village de Baracques, Calais and Cap d’Alprech, Boulogne. On 17 May, Lady Heath landed at Lympne after crossing the Channel during her [...] flight to Croydon from Cape Town, South Africa. She was flying an Avro Avian III which had been taken out to South Africa by ship. In August, the AuxAF held their annual Air Defence Exercises. Both 600 (City of London) and 601 (County of London) Squadrons AuxAF were based a Lympne {{for the duration of the}} exercise. They were operating Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. Towards the end of the camp Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill and Under Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon inspected both squadrons and were entertained at a dinner. On 18 September, Juan de la Cierva departed from Lympne in an Autogyro, making the first flight between London and Paris in this type of aircraft and the first flight across the Channel by autogyro in the process. In November, a Handley Page W.10 of Imperial Airways diverted to Lympne in a gale with three passengers suffering from airsickness. Once landed the aircraft was briefly lifted from the ground in a gust whilst ground handling staff were taking it to a hangar. Winds of [...] were recorded.|$|R
