5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled <b>equipment</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective <b>equipment</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E

5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other <b>equipment</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky <b>equipment</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wanat {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts.
