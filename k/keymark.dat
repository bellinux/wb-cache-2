40|$|This article {{describes}} comparative testing of thermal conductivity {{on a range}} of thermal insulation products used in the construction of buildings. This testing was arranged by the CEN <b>Keymark</b> scheme for voluntary certification of insulation within Europe, and measurements have been performed using over 50 instruments in more than 25 registered laboratories. The uniformity of the material and a unique thermal conductivity value for each set of test specimens that were used in the comparison have been established according to the <b>Keymark</b> scheme rules, which were developed by experts from the most respected European laboratories. These experts include most of the laboratories responsible for characterizing the European certified reference material (IRMM 440) for thermal conductivity measurements on thermal insulation products (Quin, Venuti, De Ponte, 2 ̆ 6 Lamberty, 2000). The sets of test specimens that have been characterized by the expert group were circulated and measured by the laboratories registered within the <b>Keymark</b> scheme, and the results are presented in this article and compared to the results of the first comparative testing in the <b>Keymark</b> scheme carried out up to August 2003 and presented at ITCC 27 (Rasmussen 2 ̆ 6 ITCC 27 Paper, 2003). The voluntary <b>Keymark</b> scheme works alongside the mandatory CE conformity mark (CE mark) used within the European Union and includes rigorous auditing and assessment of measurement capability, which provides a high level of confidence in measured thermal conductivity values produced by registered laboratories.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} decade the use of solar thermal {{products}} has grown drastically all over the world. One reason for this increase was the implementation and continuous further development of specific standards series like the EN 12975 [1], EN  12976 [2] and EN 12977 [3] {{as well as the}} European certification scheme Solar <b>Keymark</b> which has become the most important certification scheme worldwide. The Solar <b>Keymark</b> being the world wide largest certification program with approx. 1600 certificates is not only accepted basically throughout Europe but is also introduced in other regions such as Northern Africa or Latin America and other countries like Japan or Canada. With the latest revision of the EN 12977 series Solar <b>Keymark</b> can now also be granted for so-called custom built solar thermal systems as well as for solar thermal heat stores. In order to support the global solar thermal market further developments of the International Standards and the implementation of a global certification schemes are essential. The first steps have been taken in the field of the solar thermal collectors. In 2011 ISO TC 180 decided to join their efforts in the review of the EN  12975 series dedicated to solar thermal collectors with CEN TC 312 {{to come up with a}} joined standard. The FDIS/ISO 9806 is currently under enquiry and is expected to come in force as EN ISO 98096 by the end of 2013. This standard will pave the way towards a global certification scheme which is currently under discussion between the already existing schemes Solar <b>Keymark</b> and SRCC with the support of certification bodies (e. g. AENOR and DINCERTCO) and Research and Testing Centre for Solar Thermal Systems (TZS) at ITW, University of Stuttgart being one of the leading test laboratories worldwide. Apart from the well-known collector technologies the EN ISO 9806 will cover in addition concentrating and tracking collectors, air collectors and PVT collectors. Besides the harmonization of existing standards another important topic is the development of new test procedures in order to make the existing standards applicable for new developments and to reduce testing costs as well as the implementation of new standards. Just lately ITW/TZS developed an indoor test procedure for complete solar thermal domestic hot water systems which will help to reduce the testing time and development periods. Examples for new standards are standards for the absorber durability, the durability and performance testing of evacuated tubes and the durability and performance testing of heat pipes which are currently under development in cooperation of ISO TC 180 and CEN TC 312. Additional work is done in the project SpeedColl funded by the German Government. Here the project partners ITW/TZS and Fraunhofer ISE are developing test procedure for accelerating aging testing of complete solar collectors. This conference contribution will give an overview of the current international standards, the ones to come and new test procedures. In the field of product certification it will provide a review of the existing Solar <b>Keymark</b> certification and an outlook to the currently discussed global certification scheme. The advantages of a global certification scheme on the future development of the worldwide market for solar thermal products will be described as well as the roadmap towards its implementation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe EN/ISO 9806 {{standard}} for collector testing is expected published in 2013 - and could then form {{a basis for}} a global collector certification scheme. The objective is to propose a way towards global certification of solar collectors - {{and to make the}} first steps. Introducing a global certification scheme is an ambitious task. A pragmatic approach could be to work “step by step” e. g. : First investigate possibilities for harmonizing the main existing certification schemes. And then - if this shows successful - to harmonize with more existing certification schemes and implement the harmonized scheme in countries with no certification scheme. Two existing successful certification schemes are Solar Keymarki and SRCCii. Solar <b>Keymark</b> covers around 90 % of the European solar collector market and SRCC has similar success at the North American market. Some cooperation is already taking place at testing level between the two certification schemes - giving a good basis (together with the up-coming EN/ISO {{standard for}} collector testing) for aiming at a common certification scheme. Both Solar <b>Keymark</b> and SRCC are already “spreading” out in neighboring regions. Similar schemes are being established in e. g. North Africa and South America. Next step could be to implement the common certification scheme in interested countries, adapting the scheme rules to new conditions if necessary...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEurope, North America, Australia {{and other}} {{individual}} countries have certification and testing procedures for solar thermal equipment designed to support innovation and product development {{and to protect}} consumers from poor performance and unsafe designs. For the first time, {{as a result of}} the international coll aboration under the IEA-SHC Task 43 umbrella and the working groups of Solar <b>Keymark</b> Network, SRCC, ISO/TC 180 and CEN/TC 312, it has been possible to develop a common international standard draft for solar thermal collector testing. This paper describes in detail the new ISO/DIS 9806 standard and the relevant topics which clarify and refine existing test procedures or extend their scope: including solar air heating collector testing and tracking/concentrating collector testing. The new ISO/DIS 9806 standard opens the door to a global certification scheme for solar thermal collectors, thereby helping to overcome problems resulting from many different regional certification schemes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe most {{important}} standard for collector testing in Europe is the EN 12975 : 2006 which is applied {{in all the}} major laboratories and is the reference for the Solar <b>Keymark</b> certification. Besides the steady-state method, the EN 12975 allows {{the application of the}} quasi-dynamic method performed outdoors in natural conditions with variable radiation and ambient temperature. The available number of days for each test was investigated by analyzing meteorological data series acquired in the Solar Energy Laboratory (LES) in Lisbon since 2008 showing the advantage of the quasi- dynamic test. Both the steady-state and the quasi-dynamic methods were applied to five collectors of different types. The results were compared and a good agreement between the steady-state and the quasi-dynamic test results was observed. Issues concerning the incidence angle modifiers and the effective thermal capacity of the collectors were analyzed in detail, which resulted in the identification of model and test limitations. Suggestions are given to improve the test methodology and the data analysis of quasi-dynamic test...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPresently, only {{a limited}} number of hybrid {{collectors}} and systems are available. Hybrid solar PV/T has the potential to become a major player in the renewable energy sector, but one of the most important barriers is the inexistence of a proven track record in terms of reliability and performance. In order to address this issue, an in-depth study was realized to monitor in-field energy performances of two solar domestic hot water installations near Lyon (France). The two sites was equipped with an innovative unglazed PV-T collector, the DualSun technology. With 9 m 2 of DualSun collectors, hot water needs for 4 people were 91 % covered from May to September, with an average annual coverage of 50 %. These results are really similar to classical solar thermal performances. Temperatures in the used panels never exceeded 68 °C, demonstrating that there is no risk of overheating nor PV encapsulation degradations. The obtained performances were as high as expected from the Solar <b>Keymark</b> normative coefficients...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid Photovoltaic-thermal-collectors (PV-T) {{may have}} a number of {{advantages}} compared to stand-alone PV or solar-thermal-collectors. To mention one of them for example the overall efficiency of a PV-T-system is higher than the efficiency of the individual systems [1]. Recently, there have been efforts by the “European Solar <b>Keymark</b> Network ” and also in national organizations to standardize PV-T collector measurements and make it possible to assign a “Solar Keymark”. That would be a great benefit for PV-T collectors and subsidiary for a successful implementation in the market. Fraunhofer ISE runs an accredited laboratory for solar thermal components (TestLab Solar Thermal Systems) and also an accredited test centre for PV modules (TestLab PV Modules) and is able to combine both strengths to measure uncovered PV-T collectors and covered PV-T collectors properly. Based on the testing facilities for solar air-collectors, PV-T air-collectors can be tested as well. Recently even Concentrated PV-T collectors {{are in the process of}} getting characterised. By testing several PV-T collectors Fraunhofer ISE has created special know-how for measuring different PV-T collectors and developed an automated procedure for efficiency tests. In this paper, the interest in the standardization of measurements of a PV-T collector is discussed, and different measurement procedures are shown. It illustrates possible testing methods for different collectors, testing procedures and results from tests already performed. 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{laboratories}} {{within the}} scheme of the voluntary surveillance system for technical insulation materials in Europe (VDI/Keymark), a proficiency test {{is the basis for}} obtaining a “registered laboratory. ” The VDI/Keymark is a cooperation between the VDI, The Association of German Engineers, and the <b>Keymark</b> Group dealing with European voluntary product certification systems, within the scope of thermal insulation materials. Registered laboratories are allowed to conduct measurements to verify the declared thermal conductivity curve of technical insulation materials under the umbrella of the quality mark “VDI/Keymark”. The initial characterization work on a round robin material for the determination of thermal conductivity at higher temperatures led to the selection of an expanded glass granulate. With all the results of the round robin tests produced by five European laboratories, the expanded glass granulate has become a very important material for establishing a reliable European level of thermal conductivity at higher temperatures with a moderate uncertainty. The German expert group “AK-Thermophysik ” of the Association of Thermal Analysis (GEFTA, Gesellschaft für Thermische Analyse e. V.) further initiated a round robin test for thermal conductivity in 2012. With this additional use of the expanded glass granulate, more experience with transient methods and thermal conductivity values in the extended temperature range could be obtained. A comparison with the reference curve of the VDI/Keymark indicates very good compliance for mos...|$|E
40|$|In December 2002 {{more than}} 40 solar thermal {{companies}} and associations joined {{forces in the}} European Solar Thermal Industry Federation (ESTIF), to strengthen support for this clean technology on the European level. ESTIF aims at building a close partnership between industry and public authorities in order to overcome the main barriers to growth. Over the last 6 months we have seen some positive developments, which we could build upon. Here are some examples: 1. Germany, {{the country with the}} largest demand for solar thermal technology, is back on track to repeat the growth rates we have witnessed in the 1990 s. 2. The rules for the solar <b>Keymark</b> quality label were approved by CEN board in January 2003. 3. The city of Madrid became the first European capital to follow the example of Barcelona in requiring the use of solar thermal in new residential buildings. 4. The long awaited ''Sun in Action II - a solar thermal strategy for Europe was published last month. 5. Now, the first European Solar Thermal Energy Conference brings together decision makers from industry and politics to discuss the future of renewable heating and cooling in Europe. - Solar thermal has a great potential - 1. 4 billion square meters in the 15 EU member states alone. 99 % of this potential are still to be developed. ESTIF has made it its mission 'to achieve high priority and acceptance for solar thermal as a key element for sustainable heating and cooling in Europe and to work for the implementation, as soon as possible, of all steps necessary to realise the high potential of solar thermal'. With estec 2003 we offer a platform to exchange information and opinions concerning how this goal can be achieved. The developments in different countries show that the use of solar thermal technologies does not depend on climatic conditions alone. (orig.)

40|$|AbstractIn {{the face}} of {{continuous}} increase in oil demand in the international market {{over the last few}} years, coupled with the stabilization of national hydrocarbon resources and the growth in the national demand of energy, since 2000 the energy balance in Tunisia has been characterized by an energy production deficit. Therefore, since 2005, Tunisia has committed to a national plan of energy conservation and renewable energy development, with the goal to reduce (fossil) energy consumption 24 % by 2016 and 40 % by 2030. Conscious of the energy challenges, the Tunisian Government through the National Agency for Energy Conservation (ANME) has established an ambitious program to promote solar water heaters (SWH), called “PROSOL”, which has already increased the installation rate of solar thermal from 7 000 m 2 /year to 80 000 m 2 /year. PROSOL is being implemented in three steps: residential, tertiary, and industrial. The Residential PROSOL financial mechanism focuses on the removal of two major barriers to the final consumer: the heavy initial investment and the high payback time in comparison with other conventional technologies. Promoting the quality of solar installations is a central objective of the program PROSOL Tunisia. Installation objectives in the tertiary sector during the period 2010 – 2016 are 30 000 m 2, with 15 000 m 2 already completed and 4 000 m 2 expected completed in 2013 alone. Financing is supported by UNEP and ANME and is provided at several points in the project cycle including subsidies of feasibilities studies, capital cost, and maintenance. The third mechanism is Industrial PROSOL. Since 2010, this solar process heat program has been developed with the aim to install 30 000 m 2 in the industrial sector during the period 2010 - 2016. This is a pilot phase for establishing a funding mechanism appropriate to the industrial sector, identifying barriers to {{the development and implementation of}} the first solar installations in industrial process in Tunisia. The first installation of 955 m 2 in the textile sector will be in operation by the end of 2013. The PROSOL Program creates a real change of scale in the market for solar water heaters in Tunisia. The typical indicators of development continue to advance for this market as the programs advance, including a substantial increase in local manufacturing, local job creation, financial and energy savings to the State, and emissions avoidance. Finally, the requirement of QUALISOL and SWH certification based on Solar <b>Keymark</b> standards ensures a lasting quality and durability to the sustained growth of the solar thermal market in Tunisia...|$|E
