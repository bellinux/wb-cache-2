In 2003, two California babies, Zachary Wyvill and Zachary Black, were both born with Glutaric acidemia type I. Wyvill's birth hospital only tested for the four diseases mandated by state law, while Black was born at a hospital that was participating in an expanded testing pilot program. Black's disease was treated with diet and vitamins; Wyvill's disease went undetected for over six months, {{and during that time}} the damage from the enzyme deficiency became irreversible.

25|$|The {{greatest}} indigenous {{influence on}} the Jindyworobaks was literature which had been taken down by white folklorists and anthropologists. Written, as opposed to transcribed, indigenous literature did not appear in print until the 1920s when David Unaipon, a Christian from Point McLeay mission, South Australia, published {{a large body of}} work. Unaipon was publishing into the 1950s, by which time the Jindyworobaks were in decline.

There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T.

The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Psychiatrists in {{the early}} 1950s {{discovered}} that a class of drugs known as typical antipsychotics (also known as major tranquilizers), were often effective at reducing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. The introduction of the first widely used antipsychotic, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), in the 1950s, led {{to the release of}} many patients with schizophrenia from institutions in the years that followed. By the 1970s researchers understood that these typical antipsychotics worked as antagonists on the D2 receptors. This realization led to the so-called dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which postulates that schizophrenia is largely caused by hyperactivity of brain dopamine systems. [...] The dopamine hypothesis drew additional support from the observation that psychotic symptoms were often intensified by dopamine-enhancing stimulants such as methamphetamine, and that these drugs could also produce psychosis in healthy people if taken in large enough doses. In the following decades other atypical antipsychotics that had fewer serious side effects were developed. Many of these newer drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors, but instead produce alterations in dopamine activity indirectly. These drugs were also used to treat other psychoses. Antipsychotic drugs have a broadly suppressive effect on most types of active behavior, and particularly reduce the delusional and agitated behavior characteristic of overt psychosis. There remains substantial dispute, however, about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improvement the patient experiences on these drugs.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{referred}} to as international languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed {{on the basis of}} Western European languages. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for Volapük and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Occidental and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough. [...] One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular. [...] Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language {{has more to do with}} the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Indo-European language it even is.
