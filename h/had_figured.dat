5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was {{viewed by}} many critics as Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s Jews <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> in either a marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E

Detailed memoranda were presented relating to the availability of alternative public transport, and statistics as to the usage of the line. The section proposed for closure <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> in the first Beeching Report as an 'unremunerative line', one earning less than £5,000 per annum in revenue.|$|E

Though he rejects Joe's offer (and ends up investing the money in Roy's airline), he ends up dating Helen, and eventually proposes to her. Helen accepts, but ends up leaving him for Joe. Toward the end of the series, Helen reveals she never broke off the engagement. She <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> he was gone after he was skirted off to Burma {{in the wake of a}} coup d'etat to salvage major investments he had in the company. He was then placed under house arrest by the military junta. Upon his release, Davis returns to see Helen, but while she is trying to work up the courage to tell him she has married someone else, Davis announces that he will be unable to marry her, having fallen in love with a woman who worked for the State Department and had risked her life to secure his release.|$|E

25|$|It {{has further}} been {{suggested}} that John Milton's Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) is a sequel to Tempe Restored, a masque in which Circe <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is {{a reversal of the}} Greek myth. At the start of the masque, the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.|$|E

John Chiles came in at quarterback; his one play, a zone-read handoff to Jamaal Charles, produced 24yards.

500|$|Through {{the later}} 1950s Thorpe juggled his legal and {{television}} {{work with his}} political duties in North Devon, where he worked tirelessly to build up support. From September 1956 the Liberal Party was led by Jo Grimond, a more up-to-date figure than his elderly predecessor Davies, and {{more in tune with}} the ideas of Thorpe and the Radical Reform Group. [...] After an uncertain beginning—the Liberals lost one of their six seats to Labour in a February 1957 by-election—Grimond's leadership began to produce results. The party polled well in a series of by-elections during 1957 and 1958, culminating in a victory at Torrington in March 1958—a seat which the party had not even contested in the 1955 general election. Thorpe, who <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> prominently in the Torrington campaign, saw this victory in an adjoining Devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success.|$|E
500|$|Julia Ward of TV Squad exclaimed {{that the}} episode's three storylines were [...] "all brilliant". She praised Alec Baldwin, saying that [...] "his {{negotiation}} scenes were gold {{as was his}} line delivery". She felt that Baldwin's great acting was [...] "not unique to this episode", and was what earned him the Golden Globe. Ward finished her review by {{saying that it was}} [...] "satisfying to see a show come together as 30 Rock [...] past few weeks- settling into its rhythm [...] finding its feet". Eric Goldman of IGN felt that this episode [...] "did a very skillful job of juggling three different storylines, all of which delivered solid laughs". He thought that the crew of 30 Rock <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> out [...] "better uses for Jenna, and this episode offered some nice moments for her". He also enjoyed Tracy and Kenneth's subplot, saying it [...] "was a decent one".|$|E
500|$|After the {{turbulent}} 1800 papal conclave, Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) shunned {{the institution of}} the cardinal-nephew and instead relied on his Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi. During the 19th century, the only nephew of a Pope created cardinal was Gabriele della Genga Sermattei, nephew of Pope Leo XII, created cardinal by Pope Gregory XVI on February 1, 1836. Although the institutionalization of nepotism disappeared in the 18th century, [...] "pietas" [...] (duty to family) remained a theme of papal administration into the 20th century, although rarely with the overt intervention of a papal uncle. Following the example of Pius VI, Popes Leo XIII (who elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, cardinal on May 12, 1879) and Pius XII (1939–1958) weakened the formal curial bureaucracy in favor of a parallel government, in which family members often figured prominently. The loss of temporal power over the Papal States (de facto in 1870 with the [...] "Roman Question" [...] and de jure in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty) also eliminated the structural conditions which <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> prominently in the family politics of earlier Popes.|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} given a short refit, during which her eight-inch gun turrets were removed and {{replaced}} by quadruple 1.1-inch (28mm) anti-aircraft guns. Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Task Force 11 on 1 April and it was reorganized to consist of Lexington and the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] as well as seven destroyers. The task force sortied from Pearl Harbor on 15 April, carrying 14 Buffalos of VMF-211 to be flown off at Palmyra Atoll. After flying off the Marine fighters, the task force was ordered to train with the battleships of Task Force 1 {{in the vicinity of}} Palmyra and Christmas Island. Late on 18 April, the training was cancelled as Allied codebreakers <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> out that the Japanese intended to invade and occupy Port Moresby and Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands (Operation Mo). Therefore, Fitch's ships, acting on a command from Nimitz, rendezvoused with TF 17 north of New Caledonia on 1 May, after refueling from the tanker [...] on 25 April to thwart the Japanese offensive. At this time, Lexingtons air group consisted of 21 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators.|$|E
500|$|The {{teams of}} several of the general {{classification}} contenders were prevalent {{on the front of the}} peloton as they set about reducing the advantage that the breakaway group of six riders were holding over them. The gap had been reduced to around the three-minute mark with [...] left of the stage to cover. Another big crash happened some [...] later with 's Simon Gerrans, [...] rider Pim Ligthart and Dan Martin of [...] among those to hit the tarmac. [...] moved forward, and pulled the gap under two minutes and caused the breakaway to splinter through pressure. Bernaudeau– who <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> at each of the mountain passes to the point– and Doi failed to stay with their companions as they approached the day's final climb, the Côte de la Sizeranne. Tjallingii was also dropped by the remaining members of the breakaway, while in the main field, Alexander Vinokourov (...) and Andy Schleck of – who had been criticised by team manager Johan Bruyneel for his poor opening half to the season– were both struggling off the back of the group. Both riders lost over three minutes by the stage end.|$|E
500|$|The third book shows {{strongly}} {{the increased}} influence of Wert, {{by that time}} Monteverdi's direct superior as maestro de capella at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from Gerusalemme liberata, and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half {{of the contents of}} the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses. Of the Guarini settings Chew writes: [...] "The epigrammatic style... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period... often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances". Chew cites the setting of [...] "Stracciami pur il core" [...] as [...] "a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice". Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} troubles fitting the entire game {{on a single}} Game Boy Advance cartridge: while {{they had the same}} amount of memory available as when they made the first Ace Attorney game, Trials and Tribulations was 2.3 times as large content-wise. To accomplish this, they made use of [...] "tricks and workarounds" [...] they <b>had</b> <b>figured</b> out since working on the first game: for instance, they worked to create better structures for storing data efficiently, better compression of the graphical data, and good sounds that only use little data. Takumi found these constraints fun, as it was a chance to improve the team's abilities and a source of inspiration for doing as much as possible within the memory limitations. They still ended up having to cut or change several features: along with the art of the younger Mia, Phoenix and Edgeworth in the flashback episodes, they had planned to have new art assets for a younger Gumshoe, with his tie tied tightly and with only one hair spike, but had to settle for giving him a new coat. The character Oldbag from the first game was first cut, then included as a cameo at the end when they realized that they had just enough space for her; Takumi wanted to have her wear a lei as she would have just come back from a Hawaii trip, but was unable to due to memory limitations. Due to miscalculations of the game asset size, they had to make the character Bikini shorter in order to save some memory.|$|E
