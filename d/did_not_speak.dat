5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E

5|$|Adams <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At the suggestion of a promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E

5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
