2500|$|Black leather combat boots {{began to}} be {{provided}} to the RLAF in the 1960s by the Americans, who issued both the early US Army M-1962 [...] "McNamara" [...] model and the M-1967 model with [...] "ripple" [...] pattern rubbler sole. A few Laotian pilots and senior officers managed to acquire the US Army <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot,</b> a highly prized item not issued to the RLAF whilst local copies of the South Vietnamese Bata tropical boot were worn by some ground personnel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the Vietnam conflict, some U.S. Army units were {{equipped}} with the M-1945 Tropical Combat Boot. [...] In 1965, a boot incorporating most of the improvements developed since the end of World War II for tropical climates was adopted by the U.S. military as the M-1966 <b>Jungle</b> <b>Boot,</b> developed by the Natick Laboratories and the shoe industry. In the improved boot, the upper was made of cotton canvas duck, with leather for the toe and heel, and nylon reinforcements for the neck of the boot. [...] The new <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> originally used a Vibram-type lugged composition rubber sole strongly vulcanized to the leather toe and heel. [...] Water drains (screened eyelets) were added to the canvas top near the sole to quickly drain water from the inside of the boot. [...] Removable ventilating insoles made of fused layers of Saran plastic screen, first invented in 1942, were issued with the <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The use of Jungle or Hot Weather boots predates World War II, when {{small units}} of U.S. {{soldiers}} in Panama were issued rubber-soled, canvas-upper boots for testing. [...] Developed {{in conjunction with}} the U.S. Rubber Company, a pair of Jungle boots weighed approximately three pounds. Adopted in 1942, the design of the <b>Jungle</b> <b>Boot</b> was {{based on the idea that}} no boot could possibly keep out water and still provide sufficient ventilation to the feet in a jungle or swamp environment. [...] Instead, the <b>Jungle</b> <b>Boot</b> was designed to permit water and perspiration to drain, drying the feet while preventing the entry of insects, mud, or sand.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1966, after {{numerous}} {{widely reported}} incidents of foot injuries to U.S. forces caused by punji stake traps, issue <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> were {{fitted with a}} stainless steel plate inside the boot's sole to protect the wearer from punji stake traps. [...] Later <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> were given nylon canvas tops in place of cotton duck. The boot was also fitted with other improvements, including the Panama mud-clearing outsole and nylon webbing reinforcement on the uppers. [...] However, Vibram-soled <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> continued to be issued to troops into 1969.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> are a type {{of combat}} boot {{designed}} for use in jungle warfare or in hot, wet, and humid environments where a standard leather combat boot would be uncomfortable or unsuitable to wear. <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> have vent holes in the instep and sometimes a canvas upper to aid in ventilation and drainage of moisture.|$|R
5000|$|The US {{military}} <b>jungle</b> <b>boot's</b> popularity {{extended beyond}} the US Armed Forces with Australian Army and New Zealand Army soldiers going {{to great lengths}} to get a pair of <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> from American troops to use alongside their standard-issue black leather General Purpose Boots (GP Boots). When the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) was deployed to South Vietnam and served alongside the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade in 1965, many Australian troops were willing to trade their Australian Army-issue [...] "slouch hats" [...] for a pair of <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> from the Americans since the boots Australian troops were issued were World War II vintage tropical studded Ankle Boots and the boots were not suited to the conditions of Vietnam. Australian and New Zealand Special Air Service troops also made extensive use of American <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> {{during the course of the}} Vietnam War and they were very popular with SAS troopers. Up until the replacement of the GP boots for the Terra Boots in 2000, Australian military personnel were allowed to wear the US military <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> with their combat uniforms and the boots remained popular with Australian soldiers during the post-Vietnam period.|$|R
50|$|British Imperial forces {{designed}} {{their own}} <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> {{based on the}} American one, but much higher. Special Operations Executive Force 136 personnel were issued with these boots during operations in Burma 1944-45. Otherwise, they were not issued until after the war where they {{were used in the}} Malayan Emergency.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, the US Army {{switched}} to shined black combat boots, although {{the transition to}} black boots was not completed {{until late in the}} Vietnam War, which also saw the introduction of the <b>jungle</b> <b>boot.</b> Both of these boots had a direct molded sole. The <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> had a black leather lower and an olive drab nylon upper. Black boots continued to be worn following Vietnam, with the M81 BDU, although non-shine boots were considered by the Army. As the BDU was replaced with the MCCUU, Army Combat Uniform, and Airman Battle Uniform the services transitioned to more practical, non-shine footwear. The only current military service mandating shined black combat boots are the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, the Auxiliary Cadet Detachment of the Naval forces, and the Civil Air Patrol, the Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, in conjunction with the BDU utility uniform.|$|E
50|$|Black leather combat {{boots were}} also {{provided}} by the Americans who issued both the early US Army M-1962 'McNamara' model and the M-1967 model with 'ripple' pattern rubbler sole; the US Army <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> of Vietnam War fame {{does not appear to}} have been much favoured by Nicaraguan soldiers and Police officers alike, who preferred to wear the black leather ones even while operating in tropical jungle or marshy ground environments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> {{supplied}} by various manufactures are also commonly worn in barracks {{due to the}} ability to carry out loaded marches faster and for longer.|$|R
50|$|The French issued rubber/canvas <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> {{manufactured}} by Palladium {{during the first}} indochina war. They came in different variants and were also worn during the Algerian war.|$|R
5000|$|Field {{reports from}} the Panama Experimental Platoon on the new {{lightweight}} boots were positive, and M-1942 <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> were later issued {{to a number of}} U.S. Army and Marine forces for use in tropical or jungle environments, including U.S. Army forces in New Guinea and the Philippines, and in Burma with Merrill's Marauders, the 1st Air Commando Group and the Mars Task Force (5332nd Brigade, Provisional). [...] As <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> wore out more quickly than the standard Army Type II field shoes, they were often carried by infantrymen attached to the field pack as a secondary pair of footwear, to be used when encountering heavy, soft mud.|$|R
50|$|As of 2005, the United States Marine Corps has retired {{the black}} jungle boots from front-line {{military}} service and {{replaced them with}} two versions of a new tan rough-out leather combat boot. One version, called the Temperate or Infantry Combat Boot, has a waterproof Gore-Tex lining inside. The Temperate Boot is an effort to keep moisture out of the boot; once the interior is soaked with water, it tends to remain there. The lining also tends to limit air exchange, limiting its use to environments with temperatures of 98 Â°F or less. Another, called the Jungle or Hot Weather boot, has no lining but retains the vent holes on the instep of the boot. The US Army and US Air Force have also removed the black <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> from frontline service for suede leather desert-style boots when the US Army adopted the Army Combat Uniform and the US Air Force adopted the Airman Battle Uniform. A number of nations outside the United States are still using and issuing the American-made <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> to their soldiers. One example can be seen in Afghanistan with soldiers of the Afghan National Army being seen wearing black jungle boots with American-made combat uniforms.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, U.S. Rubber {{purchased}} {{the remainder of}} the Gillette Safety Tire Company, and began to expand and modernize the Eau Claire factory, greatly increasing production. During World War II, U.S. Rubber factories were devoted to production of war goods, and produced military truck and airplane tires, as well as the canvas-top, rubber-soled <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> for soldiers and marines serving in tropical and jungle environments. U.S. Rubber ranked 37th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.|$|E
50|$|A rubber-soled, canvas-top <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> {{was issued}} {{during the war}} for use by {{soldiers}} in the tropical and jungle environments typically encountered in the China-Burma-India (CBI) and the Pacific theaters. The 10th Mountain Division's troopers occasionally wore the Mountain Boot, a low-quarter brown leather boot with a square toe and rocker-type sole, though this boot was phased {{out in favor of}} the Type III Combat Boot {{in the last year of}} the war. In 1944, the M-44 Combat Boot, a high-top leather boot with full laces was adopted for service, but for the duration it was primarily worn by soldiers on stateside duty.|$|E
50|$|Desert Combat Boots are type {{of combat}} boot {{designed}} specifically for use in humid or arid regions for desert warfare, where a traditional or standard issued black leather combat boot might be deemed uncomfortable or unnecessary. Like <b>jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> desert boots may implement similar designs; such as nylon canvas sides, speed lacing, and drainage vents on the instep. Boots made for desert warfare may commonly come in colors such as tan or beige, and range from dark to lighter versions of the two.|$|R
5000|$|The new M-1942 canvas-and-rubber <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots</b> with Saran mesh insoles {{were tested}} by {{experimental}} Army units in jungle exercises in Panama, Venezuela, and other countries, {{where they were}} found to increase the flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing blisters and tropical ulcers. [...] The Saran ventilating mesh insole was also used in the M-1945 tropical combat boot.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{boots are}} {{military}} boots {{designed to be}} worn by soldiers during combat or combat training, as opposed to during parades and other ceremonial duties. Modern combat boots are {{designed to provide a}} combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as <b>jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the high rate}} of {{mobilization}} called for continued orders of the standard <b>jungle</b> <b>boot,</b> as well as all versions of the black all-leather combat boots, with overlapping manufacturing of the older models and the development of the new boot. By November 1990, the rate of use in the Gulf was so high that an all-out acceleration of the Desert Boot was demanded from Wellco. Working almost round the clock, by December a pair of prototype boots was finished and delivered personally to Schwarzkopf along with commitments to high-rate manufacturing in the coming months.|$|E
50|$|Today, Altama Footwear and Wellco Footwear are two American combat boot {{companies}} who still manufacture the US military <b>jungle</b> <b>boot.</b> Altama began manufacturing boots {{for the military}} {{towards the end of}} the Vietnam War, in 1969, and is still supplying the military with footwear to date. Wellco gained the first government contract for boots in 1965. These companies manufacture jungle boots with waterproof insoles and Vibram or Panama outsoles with green cotton/nylon uppers and conventional eyelets. Both companies also make an updated version with a black Cordura upper and a Speedlace-and-eyelet lacing system. The company Atalaia manufactures jungle boots for the Brazilian Army.|$|E
5000|$|Increasing {{use of the}} <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> as a {{general-purpose}} combat boot {{brought more}} changes; the issue boot's Panama sole reverted to a Vibram sole in the 1980s. [...] However, the Vibram sole, while better suited to use on rocks, sand, or other hard terrain, lacked the mud-clearing qualities of the Panama sole, and was inferior to the latter for use in jungle or swampy environments. [...] Other changes were made to lower acquisition costs. By the late 1980s, incidents of heel blowouts and loss of water drains (screened eyelets) from poor materials and lack of quality control were being reported.|$|E
50|$|White {{and brown}} low laced leather shoes were {{prescribed}} to wear {{with either the}} white summer dress and the earlier AVRK khaki service/work uniform for all-ranks and, after 1956 black ones were required for Air Force officers wearing the new blue-grey officers' dress uniform on formal occasions. On service dress, all Air Force ground personnel wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; after March 1970, the KAF standardized on American M-1967 black leather and <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots, which replaced much of the older combat footwear.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, fused {{layers of}} original-specification Saran or PVDC {{were used to}} make woven mesh {{ventilating}} insoles for newly developed <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> made of rubber and canvas. [...] The Saran ventilating insoles trapped air which was circulated throughout {{the interior of the}} boot during the act of walking; moist interior air was exchanged for outside air via the boot's water drain eyelets. [...] In cold weather, the trapped air in Saran insoles kept feet from freezing by insulating them from the frozen ground; when walking, the insoles circulated moist air that would otherwise condense and freeze, causing trench foot or frostbite.|$|R
50|$|The {{only way}} to reach the river from Sairandhri is a 2 km down hill day hike along a steep winding trail to an 18-m long {{suspension}} bridge that crosses the river. There are many perennial springs along the way {{and there are many}} leeches along the trail. Wear high ankle leech proof <b>jungle</b> <b>boots</b> and apply salt or tobacco paste to your legs as a repellent. Be prepared to roll up your trousers to your knees or wear shorts to easily spot and remove leeches who may cling to your skin. Bird watching, picnicking, and photography (Photo Gallery:) may be enjoyed along the trail and near the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Black leather combat {{boots were}} {{provided}} by the Americans who issued both the early US Army M-1962 'McNamara' model and the M-1967 model with 'ripple' pattern rubber sole, standard issue in the ARVN. In the field, field policemen generally wore the highly prized US Army <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> and black or green canvas Vietnamese-produced Bata tropical boots, replaced by leather or commercial plastic and rubber sandals while in garrison. Some individuals had zippers put into the insides of their Jungle boots {{so that they could}} be laced permanently in a fancy 'airborne' pattern, while the wearer could get into and out of his boots quickly and easily by using the zipper.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, the Panama sole {{was first}} {{developed}} by U.S. Army Sergeant Raymond Dobie, which used {{a series of}} angled rubber lugs in the soles to push soft mud from the soles, clearing them and providing much better grip in greasy clay or mud. [...] However, the Panama sole was developed too late to see service in World War II, and both M-1942 (Jungle) and M-1945 (Combat Boot, Tropical) boots used Vibram soles. [...] With {{the end of the}} war, all official interest in jungle equipment came to a halt; an improved <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot</b> with the new Panama sole was not produced until 1965.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1980s, {{some of the}} {{improvements}} incorporated {{over the years in}} U.S. <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> design were modified or discarded, primarily for reasons of cost and convenience to the contractor. [...] This included changes in rubber sole composition (to avoid marking linoleum floors at stateside army bases), and use of waterproof Poron linings instead of Saran ventilating insoles. [...] Since the boot retained its water drain eyelets, water still entered the boot, where it soaked the open-cell Poron insoles which remained in constant contact with the bottom of the foot. [...] In contrast, the British Army continues to use Saran insoles in its combat boots, primarily because of its insulating properties.|$|E
5000|$|White low laced {{leather shoes}} were worn with the FARK white cotton full dress, with brown shoes being {{prescribed}} to wear with the khaki working uniform, and later, black {{ones with the}} new ANK OG dress uniform.On the field, all Army personnel wore US brown leather M-1943 Combat Service Boots or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; paratroopers received the calf-length French M1950 or M1950/53 TAP (French: Bottes de saut modÃ©le 1950 et 1950/53) black leather jump-boot models.After 1970, the ANK standardized on the American black leather M-1967 model with [...] "ripple" [...] pattern rubbler sole and <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots, which replaced much of the older combat footwear.|$|R
5000|$|Brown low laced {{leather shoes}} were {{prescribed}} to wear with the Laotian Navy khaki service/work uniform for all-ranks and white {{ones with the}} earlier ANL white cotton full dress for formal occasions, whilst black shoes were worn with the MRL Navy Blue overseas service uniforms.On the field, Laotian seamen initially wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots and French M1917 brown leather hobnailed boots (French: Brodequins modÃ©le 1917), or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals while in garrison; after 1960, the MRL adopted as regulation footwear black leather combat boots - the early US Army M-1962 [...] "McNamara" [...] model and the later M-1967, together with limited quantities of US <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> and local copies of the South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jungle</b> footwear: vented <b>boots</b> {{to drain}} water, the best wicking socks possible, sandals with good walking straps or jungle moccasins ...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the American desert boot dates back to 1989, {{in conjunction with the}} {{development of}} a new simple all-black leather and nylon <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> to replace the vast quantities of Vietnam War-era black and olive green boots that had been issued since 1967, many of which were reaching the end of their service life after over twenty years of use. Wellco Enterprises of North Carolina was awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory to assist with a new desert boot concept, an initiative backed by Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. Commander of CENTCOM. At the time, Wellco was also producing the newer all-leather black combat boot ("Boots Combat, Mildew & Water resistant, Direct Molded Sole"). They shipped several rounds of prototype improved desert boots to Natick under the development contract.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, Kearny went {{on active}} duty as an {{infantry}} reserve lieutenant in the United States Army. Recognized for his knowledge of jungle travel and use of specialized tools and equipment, Kearny was soon assigned to Panama as the Jungle Experiments Officer of the Panama Mobile Force, and was promoted to captain. [...] In that capacity {{he was able to}} invent, improve, and/or field test much of the specialized jungle equipment and rations used by U.S. infantrymen in World War II. [...] Adoption of the jungle field ration and the jungle hammock as standard equipment by the US Army in World War II is credited to Kearny, along with improvements to many other items of tropical gear, such as the Panama-soled <b>jungle</b> <b>boot</b> and the M1942 Machete. [...] In recognition of his service, he was soon promoted to major and awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, General Schwarzkopf was {{not happy}} with the {{prototype}} desert boots he received from Wellco or with the other commercial and prototypes reviewed, and development of the desert boot was briefly halted while waiting on a decision on how to proceed. Finally, the Wellco ND914 Desert Boot was chosen from nine contenders and, during December 1990 and early January 1991, procurement gears began to turn with the first 5,000 pairs delivered on January 15, 1991. Eventually all of General Schwarzkopf's concerns were met and the updated version was made by four manufactures. Wellco Enterprises, Altama Delta Corp (Georgia), Bellevile Shoe (Illinois), and McRae Industries (North Carolina). To this day, several of these companies continue to manufacture the original issued [...] "Boots Combat, Mildew & Water resistant, Direct Molded Sole", the leather and nylon [...] "Boots, Hot Weather, Black" [...] <b>Jungle</b> <b>boot,</b> and the original Desert Combat boots in the Panama sole style and other tread styles.|$|E
50|$|MRK {{footwear}} was diverse. Ratings {{and sailors}} were issued black, brown, and whitened leather low laced shoes matching the dress uniforms worn on active service, walking-out or formal occasions. For parades, Marine officers and enlisted men were {{turned out in}} French black leather M1952 ankle boots (link=no) and white French-style half-gaiters with side-lacing and a spat covering {{the top of the}} boot; Naval Academy cadets favoured white American-style long gaiters upon the adoption of their blue full dress in 1974. On the field, both seamen and naval infantrymen wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; after 1970, the MNK retained the earlier regulation footwear although American M-1967 black leather and <b>Jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots soon replaced the older combat models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, fused {{layers of}} original-specification PVDC {{were used to}} make woven mesh {{ventilating}} insoles for newly developed jungle or tropical combat boots made of rubber and canvas. [...] These insoles were tested by experimental Army units in jungle exercises in Panama, Venezuela, and other countries, where they were found to increase the flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing blisters and tropical ulcers. [...] The PVDC ventilating mesh insole was later adopted by the United States Army for standard issue in its M-1945 and M-1966 <b>Jungle</b> <b>Boots.</b> [...] In 1943, John Reilly (Ralph Wiley's boss) and Ralph Wiley of The Dow Chemical Co. completed the final work needed for introduction of PVDC, which had been invented in 1939. PVDC monofilaments were also extruded for the first time. The word [...] "Saran" [...] was coined {{by a combination of}} John Reilly's cat's and dog's names, Sarah and Ann Reilly.|$|R
2500|$|The {{unit was}} officially {{designated}} as 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) with the code name Galahad. The men were first sent to India arriving in Bombay on 31 October 1943 to train. Here they were reinforced with Air Corps and Signal Corps personnel, {{as well as}} an animal transport company with mules and experienced muledrivers. Officers and men were equipped with U.S. HBT cotton OD uniforms, M-1943 fatigues, Type II field shoes (with or without canvas leggings), <b>jungle</b> <b>boots,</b> canvas load-bearing equipment, blanket (one-half tent or [...] "shelter-half" [...] per man), poncho, and a machete or kukri for brush clearing. Small arms included the [...]30-06 M1 Garand, the [...]30-06 M1903A4 sniper rifle, the [...]30 M1 carbine, the [...]45 Thompson submachine gun, the [...]45 M1911 pistol, the [...]30-06 BAR (M1922 machine rifle version), and the [...]30 M1919 Browning air-cooled belt-fed machine gun. [...] Mules were used to haul radios, ammunition, and heavier support weapons, including the 2.36-inch M1A1 bazooka and the U.S. 60mm M2 Mortar; the latter was often employed without its baseplate in order to speed deployment.|$|R
