Version 2 was also included in Microsoft's Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95 in early 1996, which retailed for 19.99 USD and included a how-to book and 30 days of Internet access on MSN among other features.

Sup.Ct., N.Y. Cty., March 12, 2008), a New York trial court dismissed the attorney general's deceptive-and-illegal-business-practices case against <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue.</b> The AG sought {{billions of dollars in}} penalties against <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue,</b> seeking to assert the rights of millions of consumers across the country who installed the <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> adware client. The state's undoing was <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue's</b> end-user license agreement (a click contract) and <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue's</b> agreement with its distributors (which called for fair and lawful distribution of the <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> adware client).|$|R
50|$|In People v. <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue,</b> the New York Attorney General in 2008 {{attempted}} to prevent <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> from distributing software that served pop-up advertising software on consumers’ computers. <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> did not charge fees to consumers; instead, it charges fees to the companies whose products it advertises. One {{line of attack}} by the New York Attorney General focused on <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> “click-wrapped” (where the user clicks on “I accept”) end-user license agreement (EULA) and <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> alleged deceptive and illegal practices. The court granted <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> motion to dismiss the claims, noting that sufficient disclosure was given in the EULA and the required elements for an enforceable agreement were followed. New York then focused on the customer agreements of <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> resellers, {{in an attempt to}} hold <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> liable. The result was the same as with the EULA—Direct Revenue was not held liable.|$|R
50|$|New York {{conceded that}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> resellers were {{independent}} contractors, rather than agents. Generally, a principal is not liable for acts {{of an independent}} contractor {{due to the lack}} of control over how the contractor’s work is performed. In addition, the court noted that <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue’s</b> software-distribution agreement required its distributors to obtain consumer consent consistent with the EULA and prohibited distributors from excluding themselves as agents of <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue.</b> New York argued that <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> should be liable because its servers interacted with the consumers’ computers in the software-installation process. The court pointed out that participation in installation was insufficient liability, in the absence of participation in deceptive conduct which induced the installation. Finally, New York argued that <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> should be held liable for the actions of its resellers, on the ground that <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> ratified the conduct of its resellers. The court ruled that mere knowledge of consumer complaints was insufficient to impose liability on <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue,</b> in light of the fact that when <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> had actual knowledge of reseller misconduct, it took steps to remedy the problem.|$|R

In transactions {{where the}} attorney general's investigator dealt directly with <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue,</b> {{the installation of}} the adware client was preceded by a license agreement explaining how the adware client operated and how to uninstall it; the agreement also explained the limitations on <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue's</b> liability. In each case the investigator clicked [...] "yes" [...] on a button, indicating assent to the agreement. There were problems with some installations that were initiated by <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue's</b> third-party distributors (for example, the license agreement and uninstall instructions were not always displayed prior to installation). However, the court held that <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> was protected by its Standard Distribution Agreement, a document that directed the third-party distributors to obtain legally valid affirmative consent and make all legally necessary disclosures prior to installation of the adware client. Turning back claims based on the 29 transactions completed by state investigators, the court said there was no basis to entertain the attorney general's claims on behalf of all other individuals who allegedly downloaded the <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> adware client. Finally, it held, disgorgement of profits would not be an appropriate remedy in this case; <b>Direct</b> <b>Revenue</b> distributed its adware client free of charge and took nothing of value from consumers who downloaded it.|$|R

5000|$|The {{screenplay}} {{is based}} on an article written by Ron Jones in which he talks about the experiment and how he remembers it. The rights to the story which belonged to Sony were given over to Dennis Gansel for the production of a German movie. As a consequence, Morton Rhue whose novel popularized the material in Germany and the publisher Ravensburg did not receive <b>direct</b> <b>revenues</b> from the film project. Gansel was working on the book for one year until he asked Peter Thorwarth to join him as a co-author. The screenplay moves the experiment, which was carried out in California in the 1960s, to present day Germany. The specific location is never mentioned explicitly as it stands for Germany as a whole. Gansel explained that he did not intend to reenact Jones’ experiment, but rather show how it would be carried out in present day Germany. He said the movie is not an adaption and that he changed characters, dialogues as well as the beginning and ending of the movie. This also includes subsidiary aspects such as the football team which was turned into a water polo team in the German version whose coach, as opposed to the original, is the teacher himself. The major difference, however, concerns the physical violence and the bloody end which became part of the movie. Nonetheless, Gansel claimed in an interview that it was extremely important to him to ensure that his movie would not differ as much from the experiment as Rhue’s book. Thereby he described Jones, who supported the film project as a counselor, as a [...] "living certificate of authenticity“ and that the ending was inspired by the Emsdetten school shooting. He claimed that Jones does not like the way the characters in Rhue’s novel are depicted. The former teacher commented that Gansel’s movie gave an [...] "incredibly convincing“ account of the actual experiment.|$|E
