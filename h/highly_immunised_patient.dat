40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} the natural course of whooping cough. DESIGN [...] Observational {{study of a}} general practice population. SETTING [...] Discrete semirural East Midlands practice of 11, 500 patients. SUBJECTS [...] 500 consecutive cases of whooping cough diagnosed clinically during 1977 - 92. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidence of vomiting, whooping, apnoea, admission to hospital, and complications; duration and frequency of paroxysms. Pattern of spread. RESULTS [...] The incidence in the practice population was 4347 / 100, 000 population compared with a notification rate for England and Wales of 717 / 100, 000. Most cases were relatively mild. 284 patients vomited after paroxysms, 242 whooped, and 57 had apnoea. Duration and frequency of paroxysms varied widely. Female and unimmunised patients suffered more severe disease. Bordetella was isolated from fewer <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> (24 / 96 v 63 / 122 unimmunised). Infection was usually spread through contacts with someone with clinical whooping cough. Five patients developed pneumonia, three {{of whom had been}} <b>immunised.</b> Three <b>patients</b> required hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most cases of whooping cough are relatively mild. Such cases are difficult to diagnose without a high index of suspicion because doctors are unlikely to hear the characteristic cough, which may be the only symptom. Parents can be reassured that a serious outcome is unlikely. Adults also get whooping cough, especially from their children, and get the same symptoms as children. The difficulty of early diagnosis and probability of missed cases reinforces the need to keep the incidence low through immunisation in order to protect infants, who are the most vulnerable...|$|R
40|$|A small {{outbreak}} of measles occurred after a 33 -year-old female aircrew (cabin) member presented at {{an emergency room}} with fever. Three members of the hospital staff were infected: a 42 -year-old man, a 33 -year-old woman, and a 26 -year-old woman. The first 2 patients had not been immunised, and the third had received 2 immunisations according to the Dutch National Immunisation Programme. Vaccination of the 2 sero-negative patients within 48 h after exposure with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) did not prevent the development of measles. Vaccination was deemed unnecessary in the third patient. No tertiary cases occurred. The same measles virus (genotype D 5) was detected by PCR and sequencing in all 4 patients. Measles remains a risk for hospital staff members who have not acquired natural immunity. The current policy of <b>immunising</b> <b>patients</b> within 72 h after exposure to measles may not be sufficient.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} morbilliform rash and fever in a population with high vaccination coverage for measles and rubella. Methods: Comprehensive laboratory investigation additional to routine oral fluid testing of children presenting to primary care physicians in East Anglia, England. Results: Laboratory confirmation of infection was obtained in 93 (48 %) of 195 children: parvovirus B 19 in 34 (17 %); group A streptococcus in 30 (15 %); human herpesvirus type 6 in 11 (6 %); enterovi-rus in nine (5 %); adenovirus in seven (4 %); and group C streptococcus in six (3 %) (four individuals tested positive for two agents).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To analyse the {{immunological}} {{interactions between}} the gut lymphoid tissue, synovium, and peripheral blood compartments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS [...] Patients with RA and AS and healthy controls were orally or parenterally immunised with an influenza virus vaccine. Antigen-specific antibody responses were measured at the single cell level by ELISPOT assay using lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood and from enzymatically dispersed synovial tissues. RESULTS [...] Both oral and parenteral immunisations induced antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells in the synovial tissue of patients with RA. Parenterally <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> with RA showed significantly decreased antigen-specific antibody responses in peripheral blood compared with patients with AS and with healthy controls. In contrast, oral vaccination evoked comparable peripheral blood antibody responses in all three study groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Despite a decreased immune responsiveness in the systemic compartment, the functional status of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with RA is intact. In addition, {{there is evidence that}} the lymphocytes in the inflamed joints are accessible for signals both from the systemic and mucosal compartments. The findings of immunological 'cross-talk' are relevant to future vaccination and tolerization procedures in patients with RA...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{anti-idiotypic}} {{monoclonal antibody}} 105 AD 7 mimics the tumour associated antigen 791 Tgp 72, expressed on 70 - 80 % of colorectal cancers. Phase I {{studies have shown}} that the vaccine is non-toxic, and a number of <b>patients</b> have been <b>immunised</b> prior to resection of their primary tumours.  AIMS—To assess lymphocyte activation at the tumour site by measuring expression of the α subunit of the interleukin 2  receptor (CD 25).  METHODS—Nineteen patients with primary colorectal cancer were immunised with varying doses of 105 AD 7 prior to resection of their primary tumours. Samples of normal bowel and tumour edge/centre from 16  patients were available for immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against CD 25. Samples from a matched control group were also stained. Fresh tumours from 14  immunised patients and 31  unimmunised control patients were disaggregated, and the lymphocytes obtained labelled for CD 25. Samples were analysed blindly by flow cytometry.  RESULTS—Median infiltration of lymphocytes expressing CD 25, measured immunohistochemically, was higher in trial patients, as was the ratio of tumour to normal bowel infiltration. Flow cytometric analysis of fresh tumour from <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> showed a significantly higher percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD 25 tumour infiltrating lymphocytes than their matched and unmatched controls.  DISCUSSION—The α subunit of the interleukin 2  receptor is increased on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, in <b>patients</b> <b>immunised</b> with the colorectal cancer vaccine 105 AD 7. This suggests a population of activated lymphocytes capable of targeting 791 Tgp 72 expressing tumour cells, such as circulating micrometastases. 105 AD 7 may have a role as adjuvant therapy in early stage disease.    Keywords: anti-idiotypic antibody; colorectal cancer; immunotherapy; 105 AD...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Retrospective case note review of all homosexual and bisexual men presenting to a genitourinary clinic as new patients during 12 months in 1988 and follow up review of notes to May 1990. SETTING [...] One department of genitourinary medicine, Middlesex Hospital. PATIENTS [...] 758 homosexual or bisexual men, of whom 207 started a course of hepatitis B vaccine in 1988. Case notes were unavailable for one patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The proportion of patients screened for hepatitis B virus markers, the proportion of susceptible <b>patients</b> <b>immunised,</b> the proportion completing the vaccine course, and the proportion rendered immune. RESULTS [...] 25 men had been previously tested for hepatitis markers; of the 732 not previously tested, 440 (60. 1 %) were screened for hepatitis B markers. 207 (69 %) of the 300 patients without hepatitis B serological markers started the vaccine course, and 141 (68 %) completed it, with 75 (84 %) of the 89 tested after immunisation being immune. An estimated 24 % of susceptible new patients were rendered immune {{as a result of}} the immunisation policy. Patients who presented with a further episode of a sexually transmitted disease were more likely to have been screened (25 % v 12 %, p less than 0. 0001) and immunised (31 % v 18 % p = 0. 02); those known or found to be positive for HIV antibody were more likely to have been screened (23 % v 14 %, p = 0. 047) but less likely to have been immunised (6 % v 17 %, p = 0. 004). CONCLUSIONS [...] The major failure was that in not screening; failure to <b>immunise</b> <b>patients</b> found to be susceptible and failure of compliance with the vaccine course contributed. Non-response to the vaccine was of minor importance. Improvements in vaccine delivery are required. IMPLICATIONS [...] Other providers should be encouraged to review their performance...|$|R

40|$|In late 1999, an {{outbreak}} of Bordetella pertussis occurred {{in a small town}} in North-West Western Australia. We undertook an investigation to describe the outbreak and to identify strategies to minimise the impact of future pertussis outbreaks in Australia. In November, people with respiratory symptoms were reviewed in an emergency pertussis clinic, which provided antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis. We conducted a school survey to enhance case ascertainment and followed up those attending the clinic by telephone. Fifty-nine cases of confirmed or probable B. pertussis infection were identified from 124 households (482 persons). Ages ranged from 5 months to 67 years, with children aged 9 to 11 years comprising 24 cases (41 %). Early missed diagnoses and a school camp in September attended by 2 symptomatic children appeared to facilitate spread of infection, with the outbreak peak occurring in November. From immunisation records, childhood vaccine coverage in this sample was estimated at 96 per cent. All 21 cases of pertussis among the group under 10 years of age were at least partially vaccinated. There was only one laboratory confirmed case in the high-risk, under one-year of age category. Even in <b>highly</b> <b>immunised</b> populations periodic pertussis outbreaks are inevitable reflecting a vaccine efficacy of about 80 per cent and waning immunity with increasing age. Prevention of pertussis outbreaks depends not only on high vaccination coverage among young children but also early diagnosis and management of cases and their contacts.

40|$|Hospitalisation {{and death}} from {{pertussis}} in <b>highly</b> <b>immunised</b> populations largely occurs {{before the first}} vaccination at 2 months. A Markov model was constructed to estimate the costs and health consequences of three strategies to reduce pertussis over the first 6 months of an infant's life. Earlier vaccination (at either birth or 1 month in addition to current practice) or vaccination of the parents soon after birth was compared with the current practice of vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months. The model was populated using data on the incidence and costs from Australia. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were used as the primary outcome measure. The cost to the Australian public health system {{was chosen as the}} economic perspective, and Monte-Carlo simulations were used to accommodate uncertainties in the variables. Vaccination at birth was estimated to cost (S. D.) an additional A$ 33. 21 (A$ 1. 60) per infant and to reduce cases, deaths and DALYs by 45 %. Vaccination at 1 month was estimated to cost an additional A$ 43. 24 (A$ 8. 98) per infant and to reduce morbidity by approximately 25 %. Parental vaccination at birth was the most expensive alternative, costing an additional A$ 73. 38 (A$ 4. 98) per infant and reducing pertussis morbidity by 38 %. The costs per DALY averted were A$ 330, 175 (A$ 15, 461) A$ 735, 994 (A$ 147, 679) and A$ 787, 504 (A$ 48, 075) for the birth, 1 month and parental vaccination strategies, respectively. Changing the estimated factor by which hospitalisations and deaths are under-reported, and the efficacy of early vaccination, had large effects on results. Parental vaccination at birth was most cost-effective where protection persisted for subsequent children.

40|$|AIMS [...] A {{series of}} {{patients}} with myeloma were investigated to assess whether immunological risk factors predisposing to serious infection could be identified. METHODS [...] Patients (n = 102) with predominantly plateau phase myeloma were monitored prospectively for infections. Immunological parameters including total non-paraprotein immunoglobulins and specific antibody titres were measured in all patients and compared with a control population of healthy individuals of a similar age; response to immunisation with Pneumovax II, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and IgG subclasses were measured in a subgroup of 41 patients. Other characteristics investigated for any association with infection included age, sex, paraprotein type, disease stage, and chemotherapy. RESULTS [...] Specific antibody titres to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were significantly reduced compared with the control population. Low antipneumococcal and anti Escherichia coli titres correlated with risk of serious infection and low anti-pneumococcal titres with severity of non-paraprotein immunosuppression. In 41 <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> responses to Pneumovax II, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were poor; IgG subclass levels were significantly reduced and a poor IgG response to Pneumovax II immunisation was {{associated with an increased}} risk of septicaemia and low IgG 2 levels. The overall serious infection rate was 0. 92 infections per patient year and was four times higher during periods of active disease (1. 90) compared with plateau phase myeloma (0. 49).

40|$|Amyloid is {{deposited}} in the walls of arteries and capillaries as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the brains of older individuals and of those with Alzheimer disease (AD). CAA in AD reflects an age-related failure of elimination of amyloid-beta (A?) from the brain along perivascular lymphatic drainage pathways. In the absence of conventional lymphatic vessel in the brain, interstitial fluid and solutes drain from the brain to cervical lymph nodes along narrow basement membranes in the walls of capillaries and arteries, a pathway that is largely separate from the cerebrospinal fluid. In this review {{we focus on the}} pathology and pathogenesis of CAA, its role in the aetiology of AD and its impact on immunotherapy for AD. The motive force for lymphatic drainage of the brain appears to be generated by arterial pulsations. Failure of elimination of A? along perivascular pathways coincides with a reduction in enzymic degradation of A?, reduced absorption of A? into the blood and age-related stiffening of artery walls that appears to reduce the motive force for lymphatic drainage. Reduced clearances of A? and CAA are associated with the accumulation of insoluble and soluble A?s in the brain in AD and the probable loss of homeostasis of the neuronal environment due to retention of soluble metabolites within the brain. Tau metabolism may also be affected. Immunotherapy has been successful in removing insoluble plaques of A? from the brain in AD but with little effect on cognitive decline. One major problem is the increase in CAA in <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> that probably prevents the complete removal of A? from the brain. Increased knowledge of the physiology and structural and genetic aspects of the lymphatic drainage of A? from the brain will stimulate the development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of A...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{anti-idiotypic}} {{monoclonal antibody}} 10 SAD 7 mimics the tumour associated antigen 791 T/ gp 72, present on approximately 80 % of colorectal cancer cells. A Phase I study using 10 SAD 7 in 13 patients with advanced colorectal cancer {{has shown that}} it is nontoxic, and conferred a survival advantage on patients who received it [Denton GWL 1994]. Aim. There were two aims of this work. The first was to assess whether. the survival advantage seen in the Phase I study was reproducible in a Phase II study. The second was to <b>immunise</b> <b>patients</b> with primary colorectal cancer, in a non-randomised adjuvant study, and explore further the immune responses generated. Materials and Methods. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer were recruited to a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled survival study. The first patient was recruited to this Phase II study in April 1994, and the last in October 1996. Four trial centres were used- Nottingham, Hull, Leeds, and Newcastle. Eligible patients had a life expectancy of 3 months, and none had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the preceding 1 and 3 months, respectively. Patients attended on 3 occasions, 6 weeks apart, receiving 10 µg of 10 SAD 7 /alum i. d. followed by 100 µg i. m. Venous blood was assayed for blood count and differential, liver function, urea and electrolytes, and CEA. Chest X-rays and CT scans were performed at trial entry and week 12 where possible. Dates of death were recorded following consultation with General Practitioner or referring clinician. In addition, patients with primary colorectal cancer were recruited to a non-randomised adjuvant study, whereby they received 10 SAD 7 before surgery. Venous blood samples were taken between immunisation and operation, and assayed for lymphocyte subsets. Samples taken from resection specimens were analysed immunohistochemically. Fresh tumours were in addition disaggregated, and separated TIL labelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, and analysed by flow cytometry. Control tumours were similarly labelled. All analysis was performed blind. Results. 162 patients were randomised to the Phase II study, between April 1994 and October 1996. 85 received 105 AD 7 and 77 placebo. The mean ages and sex-ratios {{of the two groups}} were comparable, as was the time from diagnosis of advanced disease to trial entry (172 v 179 days). Median survival from date on study was 124 and 184 days, in 105 AD 7 and placebo arms, respectively (p=O. 38). Survival from date of diagnosis of advanced disease was 456 and 486 days (p=O. 82). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy all prolonged survival in a multivariate analysis. Only one serious adverse event was seen in the 105 AD 7 arm, and this was felt unlikely to be attributable to the vaccine. Twenty-four patients were recruited to the adjuvant study. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumour sections from 16 patients showed increased infiltration of CD 4 and CD 8 expressing lymphocytes, relative to a well matched control group (p<O. 05). Infiltration of CD 4, CD 8 and CD 56 expressing lymphocytes combined was significantly higher, as was that of the mitochondrial antigen 7 A 6, expressed on cells undergoing apoptosis (p<O. 005). The activation marker CD 25 was also significantly increased (p<O. 05). Flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated tumours from 16 trial and 22 control patients, confirmed the increased expression of CD 25 on TIL in the 105 AD 7 group (p<O. 01). Peripheral blood phenotyping failed to show any significant increase in any lymphocyte subset, following immunisation. A separate analysis was performed comparing 2 year survival and recurrence in 23 <b>patients</b> <b>immunised</b> by the previous CRC Fellow, with 97 matched controls from the Trent Audit. No significant difference was seen between the two groups. Discussion. No survival difference was seen between patients receiving l 05 AD 7 and placebo, in the Phase II study. This suggests that any immune responses generated by l 05 AD 7 are insufficient to {{have a significant effect on}} tumour growth, in patients with advanced disease. Work has therefore focused on <b>immunising</b> <b>patients</b> with primary colorectal cancer. Patients receiving l 05 AD 7 prior to resection of their primary tumours, showed an increased number of activated lymphocytes, and apoptosis, at the tumour site, relative to a well-matched control group. The numbers in the survival analysis based on patients recruited by the previous CRC fellow, are insufficient to show whether any of these immunological changes confer a survival advantage. This question can only be answered in a large, prospective, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary colorectal cancer...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} epidemiology, primary care burden, and {{treatment}} of heart failure in Scotland, UK. Design: Cross sectional data from primary care practices participating in the Scottish continuous morbidity recording scheme between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000. Setting: 53 primary care practices (307 741 patients). Subjects: 2186 adult patients with heart failure. Results: The prevalence of heart failure in Scotland was 7. 1 in 1000, increasing with age to 90. 1 in 1000 among patients {{greater than or equal}} to 85 years. The incidence of heart failure was 2. 0 in 1000, increasing with age to 22. 4 in 1000 among patients {{greater than or equal to}} 85 years. For older patients, consultation rates for heart failure equalled or exceeded those for angina and hypertension. Respiratory tract infection was the most common comorbidity leading to consultation. Among men, 23 % were prescribed a beta blocker, 11 % spironolactone, and 46 % an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The corresponding figures for women were 20 % (p = 0. 29 versus men), 7 % (p = 0. 02), and 34 % (p < 0. 001). Among patients, 75 years 26 % were prescribed a β blocker, 11 % spironolactone, and 50 % an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The corresponding figures for patients &GE; 75 years were 19 % (p = 0. 04 versus patients < 75), 7 % (p = 0. 04), and 33 % (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Heart failure is a common condition, especially with advancing age. In the elderly, the community burden of heart failure is at least as great as that of angina or hypertension. The high rate of concomitant respiratory tract infection emphasises the need for strategies to <b>immunise</b> <b>patients</b> with heart failure against influenza and pneumococcal infection.

40|$|In {{the light}} of our observations, we have {{considerable}} sympathy for the view proposed by Jordan Holtzman that abnormal protein accumulation in Alzheimer's disease might be {{the product of an}} upstream abnormality of protein processing and that, although amyloid ? accumulates as a consequence, its presence is merely an epiphenomenon and thus other paradigms should be explored. Holtzman, and also Peter St George-Hyslop and John Morris, 1 consider the effect of our observations on the amyloid hypothesis. In our view it is important to distinguish between the amyloid hypothesis and the amyloid-? hypothesis. The term amyloid usually refers to proteins forming aggregates large enough to be histologically detectable with amyloid stains. Although, by pathological definition, amyloid ? is always present, in fact there is little direct evidence that it has a causal role in the pathogenesis of the common sporadic Alzheimer's disease, as opposed to the extremely rare familial disease. In our view, our observation that patients with little or no amyloid ? forming aggregates large enough to be detectable by immunohistochemistry continue to have progressive cognitive decline comes close to disproving the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, but leaves open the possibility that soluble or oligomeric amyloid ? has a role consistent with the amyloid-? hypothesis. The amyloid-?/amyloid hypothesis has been the prevalent hypothesis of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease for two decades; it deserves to be thoroughly tested. Patrick McGeer discusses the possibility that the antibodies generated in response to amyloid-? immunisation might stimulate complement activation with neurotoxic consequences. Although the mechanism he proposes is credible, we have insufficient evidence to support or refute it at present. However, {{it is worth noting that}} the tangles remaining after the plaques have been removed are not “ghost” tangles (ie, tangles remaining after the neurons in which they have formed have died), but are intraneuronal tangles in viable neurons, as typically seen in unimmunised Alzheimer's disease. In other words there is no evidence for “bystander lysis” of neurons. The plaque-associated tau-containing dystrophic neurites are indeed no longer present when the plaques have been removed, but at present we do not know whether this is because they have been removed by microglial phagocytosis or have resolved by a repair process. 2, 3 The resulting level of cognitive function might be the consequence of the balance between beneficial and harmful effects of immunisation on the brain. 4 However, it is worth noting that, although our study found no evidence that the <b>immunised</b> <b>patients</b> fared better in terms of cognitive function, there was no statistical evidence that they did any worse, therefore justifying further studies. We agree that, although amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice are very good models of both amyloid-? accumulation and the effects of immunisation on accumulated amyloid ?, 4 there are also crucial differences between human Alzheimer's disease and the mouse models and that, as a result, the models might not predict what occurs in human beings. The unexpected occurrence of encephalitis in some of the <b>patients</b> <b>immunised</b> with amyloid ? is a good example of this. 5 We declare that we have no conflict of interest. <br/...|$|R

Our aim {{was to assess the}} relation between A? 42 immune response, degree of plaque removal, and long-term clinical outcomes. Methods: In June, 2003, consent for long-term clinical follow-up, post-mortem neuropathological examination, or both, was sought from 80 patients (or their carers) who had entered a phase I randomised, placebo-controlled trial of immunisation with A? 42 (AN 1792, Elan Pharmaceuticals) in September, 2000. The follow-up study was completed in September, 2006. Plaques were assessed in terms of the percentage area of the cortex with A? immunostaining (A? 42 load) and in terms of characteristic histological features reflecting plaque removal. Survival of all 80 individuals until severe dementia or death was assessed with a Cox proportional hazard model.

The risk of sepsis can be reduced by <b>immunising</b> these <b>patients</b> and by prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis. The purpose of our study was to determine compliance with the international standards for the management of splenectomised patients in the Netherlands by investigating: (i) vaccination rates, (ii) the prescription of antibiotics and (iii) information in discharge letters. A retrospective review of the medical records and discharge correspondence of 609 splenectomy patients from 1997 to 2008 was performed. Data were collected from 28 hospitals. Adherence to vaccination guidelines and the prescription of antibiotics were assessed. It was found that 85. 4 % of post-splenectomy patients received pneumococcal vaccination, 39. 4 % received type B and 32. 3 % received meningococcal group C vaccination. Also, 12. 4 % of patients were discharged on prophylactic antibiotics. In less than 25 % of cases were adequate recommendations regarding post-splenectomy management given to the general practitioner (GP). In the Netherlands, compliance with recommendations for the management of patients after splenectomy is insufficient.

40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} annual risk of {{influenza}} infection {{in children with}} cancer and the immunogenicity of a trivalent split virus influenza vaccine in these children.  METHODS—Eighty four children with cancer were tested for susceptibility to the circulating strains of influenza virus in autumn 1995 and 1996. Non-immunised children were reassessed the following spring for serological evidence of natural infection. Forty two patients received two doses of influenza vaccine. These children were receiving continuing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or were within six months of completing chemotherapy.  RESULTS—Among the 84 children tested for influenza virus susceptibility only 8 % of patients were fully protected (antibody titres ⩾ 40) against {{all three of the}} prevalent influenza virus strains; 33 % were susceptible to all three viruses. Evidence of acquired natural infection was seen in 30 % of unimmunised <b>patients.</b> Among <b>immunised</b> susceptible <b>patients,</b> 66 % made some protective response to the vaccine and 55 % showed protective antibody titres to all three viral strains following vaccination. Older age was associated with increased response to the H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 vaccine components, but total white cell count or neutrophil count at immunisation, type of cancer, or length of time on treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia did not affect response.  CONCLUSIONS—Most children with cancer studied were at risk of influenza infection. A significant response to immunisation was seen, supporting annual influenza vaccination for children being treated for cancer. ...|$|R
40|$|The amyloid cascade {{hypothesis}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is testable: {{it implies that}} interference with Abeta aggregation and plaque formation may be therapeutically useful. Abeta 42 immunisation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice prevented plaque formation and caused removal of existing plaques. The first clinical studies of Abeta immunisation in AD patients (AN 1792, Elan Pharmaceuticals) were halted when some patients suffered side effects. Since our confirmation that Abeta immunisation can prompt plaque removal in human AD, we have performed a clinical and neuropathological follow up of AD patients in the initial Elan Abeta immunisation trial. In <b>immunised</b> AD <b>patients,</b> we found: a lower Abeta load, with evidence that plaques had been removed; a reduced tau load in neuronal processes, but not in cell bodies; and {{no evidence of a}} beneficial effect on synapses. There were pathological "side effects" including: increased microglial activation; increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy; and there is some evidence for increased soluble/oligomeric Abeta. A pathophysiological mechanism involving effects on the cerebral vasculature is proposed for the clinical side effects observed with some active and passive vaccine protocols. Our current knowledge of the effects of Abeta immunotherapy is based on functional information from the early clinical trials and a few post mortem cases. Several further clinical studies are underway using a variety of protocols and important clinical, imaging and neuropathological data will become available in the near future. The information obtained will be important in helping to understand the pathogenesis not only of AD but also of other neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein aggregation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: General {{practice}} immunisation audits do {{not always}} match the national rates recorded on the New Zealand (NZ) National Immunisation Register (NIR). AIM: To complete audits at one general practice for infants requiring the primary series of immunisations (6 -week, 3 -month and 5 -month vaccines) over a 12 -month period and compare findings with the NIR audit. METHODS: A manual and electronic practice management system (PMS) audit were compared with identical NIR audit parameters for completion of the 5 -month vaccination from 1 February 2011 to 1 February 2012. All three results were then combined with further sub-audits of the total practice newborn population to produce a multifaceted audit, identifying further eligible patients. The NIR database query tool was used to corroborate data on partially <b>immunised</b> and unimmunised <b>patients</b> identified. RESULTS: All three initial audits produced different results for vaccinated and eligible patients: NIR 31 / 36; PMS audit 39 / 43; manual audit 41 / 48.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: There {{is little}} {{information}} on the potential benefit of <b>immunising</b> all <b>patients</b> with chronic lung disease in the community against influenza. The clinical effectiveness and economic benefit was established of the influenza vaccination programme in a general practice based cohort of adult patients with chronic lung disease followed up during the 1995 / 96 influenza A epidemic. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study from October 1995 to March 1996. SETTING: The study was undertaken in the Utrecht General Practices Network with six large group practices, covering a total population of approximately 50, 000 patients in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Computerised medical records of 1696 patients with chronic lung disease aged over 18 years with an indication for vaccination according to the Dutch GP guidelines were reviewed. MAIN RESULTS: The overall attack rate of any complication, including all cause death, low respiratory tract infection, and acute cardiac disease was 15 %. Exacerbations of lung disease were most frequent (13 %). Death, pneumonia, and acute cardiac disease were mainly limited to patients > or = 65 years. No effectiveness of the immunisation programme could be established in patients 18 - 64 years (n = 1066), after controlling for baseline prognosis in multivariable logistic regression analysis. In vaccinees > or = 65 years (n = 630), the occurrence of any complication was reduced by 50 % (95 % CI 17, 70 %). The economic benefit was estimated at 50 Pounds per elderly vaccinee. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in the Netherlands immunisation of elderly patients with chronic lung disease against influenza is effective and cost-saving, hence these patients should be given high priority. More, preferably experimental, {{studies are needed to}} establish whether adult lung patients under 65 years in the community will also benefit from vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Progress in the {{development}} of therapeutic interventions to treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease has been hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Ab) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against Ab and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble Ab, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble Ab, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer <b>patients</b> <b>immunised</b> against Ab. Since, soluble Ab, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against A...|$|R

Cortex from 13 AD <b>patients</b> <b>immunised</b> with AN 1792 (iAD) and from 27 non-immunised AD (cAD) cases was immunolabelled for pro-apoptotic proteins implicated in AD pathophysiology: phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), activated caspase 3 (a-casp 3), phosphorylated GSK 3 β on tyrosine 216 (GSK 3 βtyr 216), p 53 and Cdk 5 /p 35. Expression of these proteins was analysed in relation to immunisation status and other clinical data. The antigen load of all of these pro-apoptotic proteins was significantly lower in iAD than cAD (p < 0. 0001). In cAD, significant correlations (p < 0. 001) were observed between: Cdk 5 /p 35 and GSK 3 βtyr 216; a-casp 3 and Aβ 42; p 53 and age at death. In iAD, significant correlations were found between GSK 3 βtyr 216 and a-casp 3; both spongiosis and neuritic curvature ratio and Aβ 42; and Cdk 5 /p 35 and Aβ-antibody level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{adjuvant}} vaccines {{against the}} pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus became available after an accelerated registration process, safety issues dominated the public debate. As {{part of the}} immunisation campaign, the Dutch government installed an active monitoring of possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs). As part of the monitoring we conducted an anonymous prospective cohort study to identify and quantify the occurrence of AEFIs related to pandemic vaccination among the population immunised in general practice. METHOD: Adults aged 60 years and older or persons with a risk-elevating medical condition recommended for vaccination in general practice were eligible for participation. After receipt of the first pandemic vaccine the administrator handed over an information flyer of the web-based monitoring program. The patient could sign up for study participation online. Within one week, three weeks and {{three months after the}} first immunisation questions were asked about demographics and health, immunisations, injections site reactions and labeled reactions as well as other possible new AEFIs. RESULTS: In all, 3569 participants filled in the first questionnaire. Corresponding figures for the second and third questionnaires were 3395 (95. 1 %) and 3162 (88. 6 %). Mean age was 58 years (SD 15) and 50. 1 % was female. Main indication was 60 years or older followed by presence of pulmonary or cardiovascular disease. Of all participants, 1311 (37 %) reported an AEFI. Unexpected serious reactions were not reported nor were there signals of possible new AEFIs. The occurrence of an AEFI was determined by gender, age and type of co-morbidity.

40|$|Hepatitis B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) {{vaccines}} elicit strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses when delivered as DNA or virus-like particles. When foreign antigens are coexpressed with HBsAg as a fusion protein, powerful antigen-specific CTL responses are achieved. Therefore, HBsAg {{is an attractive}} vaccine vector for delivery of disease-related foreign epitopes. The capacity to elicit CTL responses compares favourably when rHBsAg vaccines are delivered by DNA- rather than virus like particle (VLP) -modalities. Human papillomavirus (HPV) -associated carcinoma {{is the second most}} frequent cancer causing death in women worldwide. A major feature of the HPV lifecycle is the immortalisation of the squamous epithelium and neoplastic growth, a result of HPV E 6 and E 7 oncogene expression. E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins are essential to maintain a transformed cell phenotype and are present in all stages of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), which make them ideal targets for immunotherapeutic therapy. In this study, we have generated an HBsAg-based vaccine platform. Using splice overlap extension (SOE) -PCR the HPV- 16 E 6 and E 7 oncogenes were fused to HBsAg (E 7 HBE 6). In the process, E 6 and E 7 were mutated to eliminate potential oncogenicity and were codon optimised for enhanced expression. The effector and memory CTL response, as well as tumour protection and therapy afforded by immunisation with E 7 HBE 6 vaccine was evaluated in mice. The E 7 HBE 6 construct was evaluated for the potential to form VLPs. Insect cells expressed E 7 HBE 6 protein at low levels which appeared to form aggregates and did not demonstrate VLP formation. The formation of E 7 HBE 6 VLPs and E 7 HBE 6 protein were undetectable when expressed from two different mammalian cell lines. Observations within these experiments suggested that the E 7 HBE 6 protein maybe unstable. Understanding the CTL response interplay between E 6 and E 7, within the context of pE 7 HBE 6 is important for its application as a vaccine. Studies were conducted using DNA plasmid HBsAg-HPV vaccine (pE 7 HBE 6). We demonstrated that pE 7 HBE 6 DNA vaccine was immunogenic at a single low dose which was enhanced by boosting. Effector and memory CTL responses to E 6 and E 7 were maintained for 23 weeks post-immunisation. A maximal CTL response was achieved from a single dose at 30 - 100 μg with a significant response also detected from a single dose of 10 μg. When a dominant CTL epitope was eliminated from within pE 7 HBE 6, a subdominant epitope response was detected. The presence of a subdominant epitope enhanced the response to the dominant epitope, at the cost of a decrease in its own effector CTL response. The immunodominance effect was decreased by combining epitope knockout vaccines, allowing processing of E 6 and E 7 CTL epitopes in separate cells. Furthermore, administration of antigens at separate anatomical sites also interfered with immunodominance. Original antigenic sin was examined by the immunisation of HBsAg-experienced mice with recombinant pE 7 HBE 6 DNA vaccine. Prevention of the growth of HPV- 16 -associated subcutaneous TC- 1 tumour was achieved in 100 % of mice by immunisation with pE 7 HBE 6, compared to mice immunised with HBsAg wildtype DNA vaccine, all of which presented with tumour. When pE 7 HBE 6 was used as a therapeutic agent, a significant increase in survival and decreased tumour volume were demonstrated. In a TC- 1 tumour metastasis model, where mice were inoculated with TC- 1 intravenously, therapy was <b>highly</b> effective. Mice <b>immunised</b> with HBsAg-HPV DNA vaccines (either pE 7 HBE 6, or combined epitope knockouts) remained 100 % tumour free compared to mice immunised with HBsAg DNA, of which 80 % displayed lung tumours. The results from this study demonstrate that a HBsAg-vectored DNA vaccine encoding both HPV- 16 E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins can be used to provide protection and therapy against a tumour expressing HPV- 16 oncogenes. This study supports previously published studies that demonstrates an enhanced HPV-specific CTL response when both E 6 and E 7 are administered together {{in the context of a}} vaccine. These results have generic implications for the design and administration of DNA vaccines encoding chimeric antigens. The results of this study have specific implications for the design of HBsAg-based DNA vaccines delivering HPV antigens for the protection and therapy of HPV-associated squamous carcinomas. An effective therapeutic vaccine designed to treat HPV-associated cancers has the potential to dramatically reduce the burden of cervical carcinoma and associated death rate...|$|R
