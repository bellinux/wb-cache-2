50|$|Among his several discoveries which sparked {{important}} {{theoretical research}} programs was the Kuznets curve, an inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality {{and economic growth}} (1955, 1963). In poor countries, economic growth increased the income disparity {{between rich and poor}} people. In wealthier countries, economic growth narrowed the difference. By noting patterns of income inequality in developed and underdeveloped countries, he proposed that as countries experienced economic growth, the income inequality first increases and then decreases. The reasoning was that in order to experience growth, countries had to shift from agricultural to industrial sectors. While there was little variation in the agricultural income, industrialization led to large differences in income. Additionally, as economies experienced growth, mass education provided greater opportunities which decreased the inequality and the lower <b>income</b> <b>portion</b> of the population gained political power to change governmental policies. He also discovered the patterns in savings-income behavior which launched the Life-Cycle-Permanent-Income Hypothesis of Modigliani and Friedman.|$|E

40|$|The South African primary rebate {{is governed}} by Section 6 of the Income Tax Act (58 of 1962). This primary tax rebate entitles taxpayers to a tax-free <b>income</b> <b>portion</b> {{up to a certain}} level {{depending}} on the rebate amount (also referred to as the tax threshold). The concept of tax thresholds in a tax system in essence adhere to the first tax canon of Smith (1776 : 676), which suggests that individuals should pay taxes in proportion to each person’s ability to pay tax. The implication of this tax canon is that individuals who have a limited or no ability to pay tax should only be subject to pay tax in relation to their ability. Therefore, before tax can be levied, an amount for the necessities-of-life must be deducted from the taxpayer’s income (Vivian, 2006 : 85). The primary rebate system thus gives individuals a tax-free <b>income</b> <b>portion</b> which is supposed to first compensate for an individual’s necessities-of-life expenses or put differently the costs to survive. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to critically analyse and compare the fairness of the primary rebates in South Africa in relation to other countries. To meet the main purpose a comparison was done between South Africa’s primary rebate and related government grant programs to that of Brazil and Australia. It was found that South Africa rebate system creates significant vertical and horizontal unfairness and that it compares poorly to the fairer multiple rebate and government grant systems of Brazil and Australia. Accordingly it was recommended that the unified primary rebate system of South Africa is reviewed and brought in line with the multiple rebate systems implemented in countries such as Brazil and Australia.

40|$|AbstractScorpion envenoming and {{malnutrition}} {{are considered}} two important public health problems in Brazil, involving mainly children. Both these conditions {{are more common}} among the economically stratified lower <b>income</b> <b>portion</b> of the population, thus suggesting that these factors should be analyzed concomitantly. It is known that cardiorespiratory manifestations, as cardiac arrhythmias, arterial hypertension and hypotension, pulmonary edema and circulatory failure are the main “causa mortis” of scorpion envenomation. Additionally, there are evidences in the literature that deficiencies in dietary intake endanger the CNS and modify the cardiovascular homeostasis. Then, {{the objective of this}} work is to evaluate the protein malnourished effect on cardiovascular responses induced by tityustoxin (TsTX, an α-type toxin extracted from the Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom). Fischer rats (n =  20) were injected i. c. v. with TsTX and divided in control and malnorished groups, which were, respectively, submitted to a control and a low-protein diet. Arterial pressure recordings were done until death of the animals. Although both groups presented an increased mean arterial pressure after TsTX injection, this increase was smaller and delayed in malnourished rats, when compared to control rats. In addition, heart rate increased only in rats from the control group. Finally, malnourished rats had an increase in survival time (9 : 9 / 13. 5 vs. 15. 5 : 10. 5 / 18  min; p =  0. 0009).

A survey using semi-structured personal interviews was carried out to obtain data on cost savings of farm-grown products consumed, health benefits derived and costs incurred in managing and maintaining each farm. There were notable differences in crop- tree arrangement and management methods used by the farmers. An estimate of the amount of product that was consumed by the households was conditional on crop choices and intensity of effort and inputs and offsets from off-farm income. Informal arrangements for bartering food, and coconut and bamboo product sharing for community use, made precise valuation of these products difficult, but comparative values against local market prices were placed on marketable produce. Labour and other inputs between the farms were varied widely, depending able and determined byon the type of product. In addition to crops grown as a source of <b>income,</b> <b>portions</b> of farm products were grown specifically for home consumption, and some non-consumable products were exchanged between households.

In this sense, this study sought to estimate the impact of increased wages paid to domestic workers, through simulations with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. As such, one can observe the implications of recent increases in the relative wages of domestic workers in Brazil, considering two concurrent effects: i) the increase in the price of domestic work; and ii) the income gains of domestic workers. Thus, one can assess not only the immediate results on the demand for domestic services but also the effects triggered elsewhere in the economy. Hence, the results indirectly show the likely consequences of formalisation and the inclusion of domestic work under the aegis of labour rights. According to the simulations presented in this study, this would lead to increased <b>income</b> for a <b>portion</b> of the population, and higher costs attached to these services...|$|R
40|$|Background: in {{developed}} countries, disadvantaged groups have higher {{prevalence of obesity}} and its associated chronic diseases than do high income groups. This study aimed to investigate the association between the level of household <b>income</b> and food <b>portion</b> size for the top 20 most frequently consumed foods by adolescents and adults. Methods: {{data for this study}} came from the UK National Diet and Nutritional Survey (2008 – 11). Using a 4 day estimated food record, we calculated food portion size for 567 adolescents (11 – 18 years) and 992 adults (19 – 65 years). For each participant, average portion size for each food was calculated by dividing the total weight of the food by the frequency of consumption; then the average food portion size was calculated for each food for the whole sample. This method avoided portion sizes being skewed because of individuals who frequently consumed small or large <b>portions.</b> Levels of <b>income</b> were classified by household income per year: low (?£ 24 ? 999), middle (£ 25 ? 000 – 49 ? 999), and high (?£ 50 ? 000). Associations with food portion size were tested with multivariable regression models adjusting for sex and age (significance at p? 0 · 01). Findings: 205, 226, and 136 adolescents and 395, 379, and 218 adults were classified as having low, middle, and high household incomes, respectively. Adolescents from low income households consumed smaller portions of “tap water” than did those in high income households (by 52 mL, 99 % CI 7 – 97; p< 0 · 0001). Adolescents from middle income households consumed larger food portion sizes of “carbonated soft drinks” than did those from high income households (40 mL, 2 – 81; p= 0 · 01). Adults in low income households consumed larger food portion sizes of “cheese”, “mashed potato”, and “savoury sauces, pickles” (by 9 g [2 – 15], 25 g [2 – 15], and 12 g [7 – 43], respectively; p< 0 · 0001), and drank smaller portions of “tap water” (34 mL [3 – 71], p= 0 · 01) than did those from high income households. No significant differences were seen in food portion sizes between adults in middle and high <b>income</b> households. Interpretation: <b>portion</b> sizes of only a few foods differed by household income; nonetheless, these foods might contribute to inequalities in healthy dietary intake in both adults and adolescents.

40|$|Background: Diarrhea {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{childhood}} morbidity and mortality. Hospitalization for diarrhea can pose a significant burden to health systems and households. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic burden attributable to hospitalization for diarrhea among children less than five years old in Rwanda. These data can be used by decisionmakers to assess the impact of interventions that reduce diarrhea morbidity, including rotavirus vaccine introduction. Methods: This was a prospective costing study where medical records and hospital bills for children admitted with diarrhea at three hospitals were collected to estimate resource use and costs. Hospital length of stay was calculated from medical records. Costs incurred during the hospitalization were abstracted from the hospital bills. Interviews with the child's caregivers provided data to estimate household costs which included transport costs and lost <b>income.</b> The <b>portion</b> of medical costs borne by insurance and household were reported separately. Annual economic burden before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction was estimated by multiplying the reported number of diarrhea hospitalizations in public health centers and district hospitals by the estimated economic burden per hospitalization. All costs are presented in 2014 US$. Results: Costs for 203 children were analyzed. Approximately 93 % of the children had health insurance coverage. Average hospital length of stay was 5. 3 ± 3. 9 days. Average medical costs for each child for the illness resulting in a hospitalization were $ 44. 22 ± $ 23. 74 and the total economic burden was $ 101, of which 65 % was borne by the household. For households in the lowest income quintile, the household costs were 110 % of their monthly income.

With this view, present study was undertaken with the objective of understanding perception of dairy farmers about clean {{milk production}}. The study was conducted in six villages of Gadag district of Karnataka state. A total of 180 respondents were interviewed. Perceptions of the farmers regarding family manpower involved in dairy farming, personnel involved in milking, dairy income, intention to produce clean milk, price dependence for following clean milk production, reasons for following cleanliness measures in milk production, sale price received for milk and satisfaction for the price they received for milk were studied. Most of the dairy farmers expressed their willingness to follow clean milk production measures. Further, most of them were ready to follow such measures even if they were not paid more price for milk. Farmers practiced clean milk production measures mainly to follow regulations at the dairy co-operative society followed by to avoid spoilage of milk. Dairy farmers largely neglected impact of cleanliness on animals' udder and health, about milk contamination causing health hazards. Milking was mainly a domain of women. For over 80 % farmers, dairy farming provided a moderate <b>income</b> as <b>portion</b> of their total family income. Majority of the producers were not satisfied with price they were getting for milk. Hence, the study recommends, requisite facilities and guidelines from the agencies concerned are needed to be provided to the dairy farmers to adopt clean milk production practices.

The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary <b>income,</b> whereas a <b>portion</b> of the gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all gains on sales of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets {{it is necessary to}} tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on sales of {{depreciable assets}} again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of depreciable assets...|$|R
30|$|The simple model’s {{specific}} {{focus on}} labor market policies can help interpret the large accumulation {{in that period}} of negative financial imbalances by peripheral eurozone countries, largely mirrored by positive balances in Germany and other core countries. Part of these imbalances reflected investment patterns and capital intensity equalization, which influences pre-tax inequality directly if wealth is more unequally distributed than labor <b>income.</b> A larger <b>portion,</b> however, was accounted for by public and private consumption and housing expenditure patterns which, as discussed in Bertola (2013), plausibly reflected productivity convergence expectations. Labor policy’s productivity and risk effects are theoretically and empirically relevant to current accounts (Bertola and Lo Prete, 2012), and may also have played a role. In the aftermath of euro adoption, for countries where economic integration and better organization were expected to increase productivity {{it might have been}} sensible to trade some of that efficiency windfall for labor income security. Between 2000 and 2007, total factor productivity and inequality both increased in the core and declined in the periphery of the euro area (Bertola, 2013), and in the data analyzed in Table 1 not only the inequality but also the employment trajectories of peripheral countries are symmetric to those of core countries. While the stronger and more significant relationship between productivity and institutional quality indicators suggests that it would be misleading to focus narrowly on labor market policy developments, the latter may indeed have contributed to accumulation of non-contingent financial imbalances that did not play a risk-sharing role, and became problematic when expectations of institutional and productivity convergence failed to be realized. From this perspective, the crisis should symmetrically trigger labor policy reforms. In terms of the average welfare criteria studied in Section 2 above, for countries that need to improve international competitiveness and repay ex-post excessive debt it would be optimal to forego some security, and increase productivity. Implementation of such structural reforms is difficult, however, for at least two conceptually different reasons.|$|R

Descriptive statistics with the mean values for different socioeconomic characteristics were taken for various tehsils of the study area. The poverty estimates were 38 percent, 34 percent and 27 percent in the rural areas of districts of Attock, Rawalpindi and Chakwal, respectively while overall poverty in the area was 33 percent. The poverty head counts were found 26 percent, 26 and 37 percent in irrigated, irrigated plus rainfed and rainfed categories of the farmers, respectively. Socioeconomic characteristics of the poor and non- poor households were also estimated. Poor were found deprived with their access to basic necessities of life as compared to the non-poor households. Agricultural <b>income</b> shared major <b>portion</b> of annual <b>income</b> of the poor households while income from business was found major source of annual income of the non-poor households. Similarly, expenditure on food was higher for poor than non-poor. Agricultural productivity and profitability was lower in the poor farm households as compared with the non-poor households.

Rs. 4. 77 /M 3, Rs. 19. 82 /M 3, Rs. 12. 71 /M 3, Rs. 6. 81 /M 3, Rs. 9. 96 /M 3, Rs. 8. 37 /M 3 and Rs. 4. 02 /M 3 for wheat, maize rabi, gram, vegetable rabi, fodder rabi, groundnut, maize kharif, sorghum, millets, vegetable kharif and fodder kharif, respectively. The proper technical design, subsidies on pumping unit and water source development are some, of the crucial factors need to be addressed for the sustainable development of irrigation schemes. Family size was positively correlated with poverty while farm size, education above matriculation, and irrigation water was negatively associated with poverty. In rainfed agriculture, seed and fertilizers were found significantly affecting crop productivity where as land preparation and pesticide had positive effect on crop productivity in the Pothowar Plateau, Punjab Pakistan. However in the irrigated cultivation, improved seed, fertilizers, irrigation water and the use of pesticides were found with significant affects to crop productivity. The access to irrigation through small-scale irrigation schemes must be encouraged to increase crop production in order to alleviate poverty in the Pothowar Plateau. The land consolidation would improve the economies of scale for the installation of irrigation schemes and would also improve the agricultural productive potential of the Pothowar area. Interventions in population planning and education sectors were suggested to overcome the issue of povert...|$|R
40|$|National {{accounting}} and national accounts concepts {{have very strong}} links to business {{accounting and}} business accounts concepts, and economic theory. The current trend in national accounting work is {{to carry out the}} task based on a framework which functions as an integrated general purpose statistical information system. The principal constraints to this approach are data availability which {{is a function of the}} standard and serviceability of the country's national statistical system, and general conventional accounting principles. It is submitted that one of the important properties that a system of national accounts should possess is inherent flexibility in order to allow such a system to respond sensitively to developments in economic theory and specialized needs/demands. Even though the development of certain national accounting principles can be traced back to the seventeenth century, national accounting generally is a twentieth century invention, with the development of the SNA as a very major breakthrough. One of the SNA's most valuable contributions is its provision of a consistent and comprehensive framework in terms of national accounting concepts, definitions and principles. The application of the conventional national accounting principles to Tonga and other developing countries has been confronted with many conceptual and statistical problems. The existence of imperfect national price systems in developing countries has led many critics to question the validity of national income estimates for such countries. It has been submitted that such imperfection of national price systems has been essentially a function of constraints on commodity and factor movements. It is argued however that many such restrictions cannot be applied with significant force to the case of Tonga and that there exists great validity and usefulness in making national <b>income</b> estimation. Non-market <b>portion</b> of total production in the economy of Tonga is significant. Its estimation for national accounting purposes is faced with the conceptual problems of setting appropriate boundary of production and imputation. The recommendations of the SNA with regard to the former are endorsed for national accounting practice in Tonga with special attention to transactions such as the unilateral provisions of free and/or partially paid services by Tongans to government and church authorities. Due to the predominantly agricultural character of the Tongan economy and the existence of a partial subsistence sector, certain conceptual problems arising from the need to make clear distinctions between production and consumption, and saving and investment in accordance with the Keynesian framework are bound to prevail with regard to national accounting in the Kingdom. There are also the problems associated with any attempt to distinguish the various factor shares of national income. Recommendations and comments concerning possible means of minimizing these problems or perhaps putting such, problems into some balanced perspective, are presented. Statistical problems faced with national accounting work in Tonga are generally associated with the inadequacy and unreliability of basic national accounting statistics, and the shortage of appropriate material and human resources. While most of the statistical problems can be substantially alleviated by more liberal direction of resources to the process of data collection and national income estimation, some of the statistical problems like the conceptual problems would persist in Tonga as long as the general standard of the Kingdom's national statistical system is low and the general state of under-development prevails. A close scrutiny of the general performance and structure of the Tongan economy, current and anticipated future needs/demands for various national accounting statistical series, and current and anticipated future status of data availability, suggests that a system of national accounts for Tonga which could bring out the important economic characteristics and inter-relationships of important sectors in the economy would be considered as very desirable. With the increasing complexity of the Kingdom's economy and associated increasing diversity of needs/demands for appropriate statistical series, it is felt that a system of national accounts which offers greater disaggregation of important aggregates and which views the production sector at some component levels such as "Agricultural", "Non-Agricultural, Non-Financial" and "Financial" production sub-sectors even though it is a diversion from the general recommendations of the SNA, would merit a high level of serviceability. A system of national accounts which is essentially based on a system of sector accounts with the incorporation of the above stated partitioning of the production sector is therefore proposed for Tonga. The proposed system also consists of sets of supplementary tables and aggregative accounts which aim at providing essential supplementary information via the adoption of different classification systems or appropriate aggregations of information exhibited in the sector accounts. Issues concerning suggested future expansion of the proposed system to include appropriate input-output matrices and flow of funds tables and the need for a proper development and application of an appropriate social accounting matrix (SAM) for Tonga are also discussed. The proposed system of national accounts for Tonga is relatively comprehensive and possesses inherent flexibility which is a reflection of its primary inheritance from the SNA. Even though it might take some time before the proposed design can be implemented in full, its relative comprehensiveness would automatically serve a lot of useful purposes e. g. its explicit facilitation of attention to gaps in the existing data series. The implementation of the proposed system is regarded as a feasible long term project for the Tonga national statistical agency. The extent to which it can be implemented in the very near future given Government's acceptance, would depend heavily on the priority level the Tonga Government attaches or would attach to the task of developing and improving the Kingdom's national accounting system...|$|R
