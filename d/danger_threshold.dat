40|$|The recent {{scandal of}} poly implant {{prostheses}} (PIP), which {{were found in}} some cases to be made of non-medical grade silicone (as reported by the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks), had a great social impact. Thousands of patients asked for implant removal with significant costs for public health care systems. We analysed, by a multidisciplinary approach, sixteen different breast implants after explantation by using several analytical and structural techniques, such as Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), mass spectrometry equipped by ion coupled plasma (ICP-MS), gas-chromatography (GC-MS), and tensile testing. Traces of organic (fatty acid) and inorganic (Fe, Cr, Pt, Na, and other metals) substances were found in all samples, and, even if these values are under <b>danger</b> <b>threshold</b> levels, our study results highlight the possibility of bioaccumulation and tissue contamination, implying the need for continuous medical surveillance and monitoring of material agin...|$|E
