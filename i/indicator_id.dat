Performance indicators take center stage as tools that provide information for decision-making. This study investigates, from the perspective {{of organizational}} performance evaluation, the characteristics of performance indicators used in research {{in the fields of}} Management, Accounting and Tourism, from 2000 to 2008. The authors opted for a descriptive study with a qualitative and quantitative approach, and they identified 2, 646 articles containing the following words in their title, abstract or keywords: evaluation, performance, decision, measurement, performance evaluation and assessment. Of these, the authors selected the articles that had the words indicator, criterion, attribute, and measure, resulting in 85 articles, the contents of which were analyzed. The authors found that 61. 14 % of these articles contained the words performance <b>indicator</b> (<b>ID),</b> whereas 73 % did not include this concept. The indicators used, in general, had an economic and financial focus and were quantitative, being measured in ordinal terms. In general, the organizational performance indicators achieved their goal of aiding the decision making process, given that 76 % of the articles studied researched the benefits of using these indicators...|$|E
40|$|Background Iron {{deficiency}} (ID) anemia impacts {{the cognitive}} and motor development of children {{until the age of}} 10 years, despite receiving iron therapy. Early det ection of ID is recommended and serum ferritin has been proposed as an alternative <b>indicator</b> for <b>ID</b> det ection. Objective To assess th e diagnostic accuracy of serum ferritin for detecting ID in children below five years of age. Methods T his cross-sectional, diagnostic study was conducted in primary health care centers in Yogyakarta and Bantu!. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels were performed on children aged 6 - 59 months. A sTfR level of 2 : 8. 2 mg/L was used to define iron deficiency. T he best cutoff point for serum ferritin level use as a diagnostic tool was determined by receiver operator curve. Results T he prevalence ofID was 32 %. Mean h emoglobin levels in iron deficient and healthy children were 11. 7 (SD 0. 5) g/dL and 12. 2 (SD 0. 7) g/dL, respectively. T he sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of serum ferritin (< 12 ug/L) were 17 %, 93 %, and 56 %, respectively. Using a cut off of < 32. 4 ug/L, serum ferritin had sensitivity of 62. l % and specificity of 50. 8 %. Conclusions The diagnostic value of serum fe rritin levels is modestly capable of detecting ID. Therefore, serum ferritin should not be used as an alternative <b>indicator</b> for detecting <b>ID</b> in children below five years of age...|$|R

It is noted that the current socio-cultural identification processes in Ukrainian society take place {{in line with the}} social transformations and require significant individual efforts, as is a significant improvement of internal spiritual and moral and emotional qualities and moral values of each person. However, they are complicated choice of any cultural models for any period of time and doubts the authenticity of cultural traditions because of their adjustment to the interests of the masses. There is a need for socio-philosophical interpretation of the major features (markers and their components – identifiers) personal identification Ukrainian, which don’t contradict each other and contribu the splitting process identity. Identity (E. Erickson) is defined as a complex personality formation, which has a layered structure related to the three main levels of human nature: individual, personal and social. One of the current areas of study identity is its multi-partition and identify the leading marker. Defined as having two levels of identity – individual and collective. Individual level revealed through the personal and social aspects, the balance which provides the balance of identity sense, self-identity, according to the circumstances and possibilities. The parameters characterize identity as individuality, identity, community, integrity, solidarity, separability, value. Defining marker of national Ukrainian identity citizens have a positive perception of the nation, country and state.

40|$|Background The {{medical care}} chain around Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is complex, with many multidisciplinary challenges. The current {{quality of care}} is unknown. Outcome-oriented quality indicators {{have the potential to}} improve medical practice and evaluate whether innovations are successful. This is particularly interesting for the evolving care for people with DS and intellectual disabilities (ID). The aim {{of this study was to}} identify existing indicators for medical DS care, by reviewing the literature. Methods We systematically searched six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar) for studies concerning the development and implementation of quality indicators for DS and/or ID care, published until February 1 st 2015. The scoping review method was used, including systematic data extraction and stakeholder consultation. Results We identified 13 studies concerning quality <b>indicators</b> for <b>ID</b> care that obtained data originating from questionnaires (patient/family/staff), medical files and/or national databases. We did not find any indicator sets specifically for DS care. Consulted stakeholders did not come up with additional indicator sets. Existing <b>indicators</b> for <b>ID</b> care predominantly focus on support services. Indicators in care for people with ID targeting medical care are scarce. Of the 70 indicators within the 13 indicator sets, 10 % are structure indicators, 34 % process, 32 % outcome and 24 % mixed. Ten of the 13 sets include indicators on the WHO quality dimensions ‘patient-centeredness’, ‘effectiveness’ and ‘efficiency’ of care. ‘Accessibility’ is covered by nine sets, ‘equitability’ by six, and ‘safety’ by four. Most studies developed indicators in a multidisciplinary manner in a joint effort with all relevant stakeholders; some used focus groups to include people with ID. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first review that searched for studies on quality indicators in DS care. Hence, the study contributes to existing knowledge on DS care as well as on measuring quality of care.

40|$|The use of {{neutrophil}} left-shift parameters in {{the diagnosis}} of inflammatory and infective disease (ID) was evaluated. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), currently the best quantitative parameter of inflammation, {{was used as the}} gold standard. Of 292 patients, 230 (79 %) had a level of CRP of 1. 0 mg/dL or greater and were classified as having inflammation, whereas 62 (21 %) had normal levels. The neutrophil band count in each patient was determined by microscopic examination of 200 WBCs. The diagnostic value of the band count as an <b>indicator</b> for <b>ID</b> was evaluated in comparison to the WBC count, the neutrophil count, and the left-shift indicators of two automated hematologic analyzers, H* 1 Technicon (Bayer Technicon Instruments, Tarrytown, NY) and Coulter MAX M (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Fla). When receiver operating characteristics were used, the band count was superior to the immature to total neutrophil count (I/T) ratio, the total WBC count, and the neutrophil count. The sensitivity and specificity in identifying ID at designated cutoff points were as follows: band count of 20 % or greater of total WBC count (53 % and 79 %, respectively), I/T ratio of 0. 25 or greater (59 % and 63 %), total WBC count of 9. 6 x 10 (6) /mL or greater (68 % and 56 %), and neutrophil count of 8. 0 x 10 (6) /mL or greater (60 % and 58 %). The performance of the H* 1 Technicon left-shift flag was similar but slightly inferior to the band count (sensitivity, 44 %; specificity, 79 %), whereas the Coulter MAX M flags had a clearly higher sensitivity (79 %) and lower specificity (53 %). In addition, microscopic evaluation to determine the presence of reactive morphologic changes in neutrophils, such as toxic granules, Döhle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuoles, had a high sensitivity (80 %) but a low specificity (58 %) in predicting ID. The diagnostic value of both microscopic and automated neutrophil left-shift parameters as <b>indicators</b> for <b>ID</b> is limited. Morphologic changes in neutrophils, however, either have a high specificity (band count) or a high sensitivity (toxic signs) in predicting ID and therefore may be a clinically useful tool...|$|R
40|$|Preterm infants {{are at risk}} of iron {{deficiency}} (ID). Hepcidin has been suggested as a good additional <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID</b> in preterm infants, next to ferritin. In a prospective observational study, we analyzed serum hepcidin in 111 infants born after 32 + 0 to 36 + 6 [*]wk gestational age during the first 4 mo of life. Hepcidin concentrations decreased during the first 4 mo of life, and concentrations were lower in infants with ID compared to those without ID. Infants who developed ID at the age of 4 mo had already significantly lower levels of hepcidin at 1. 5 mo of age, while ferritin was already significantly lower at the age of 1 [*]wk. Hepcidin concentrations of late preterm infants decrease during the first 4 mo of life. This decrease, which parallels a decrease of ferritin concentration, we interpret as a physiological response, aiming to increase iron availability. Hepcidin concentrations are lower in infants with ID compared with those without ID, with a notable change already observed at 1. 5 mo of age. Hepcidin can be used as an early marker of ID, although an additive value of hepcidin over ferritin in the diagnosis of ID is not presen...|$|R

40|$|Background/PurposeIron {{deficiency}} (ID) is {{the most}} common cause of anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate patients with oral mucosa alterations as the initial manifestation of ID or ID anemia (IDA). MethodsSixty-four patients (50 IDA and 14 ID) with a wide range of sore mouth were diagnosed and treated. The oral and physical manifestations as well as iron studies and anemia classification based on the mean and heterogeneity of red cell size were assessed. ResultsID predisposed 64 patients to a high incidence of Candida infection (85 %) and showed a variety of oral manifestations including angular cheilitis (63 %), atrophic glossitis (AG; 59 %), pseudomembranous candidosis (44 %), erythematous candidosis (41 %), median rhomboid glossitis (5 %), chronic mucocutaneous candidosis (5 %), papillary hyperplastic candidosis (3 %), and cheilocandidosis (3 %). Others included pale oral mucosa (31 %), burning mouth (28 %), and recurrent oral ulcers (6 %). Colorectal cancers in two patients were diagnosed. The values of hemoglobin (Hb) in 64 ID patients varied from normal to life-threatening levels, but none had developed advanced systemic symptoms except fatigue. All had low serum iron and ferritin. Sixty (94 %) patients had transferrin saturation <  16 %; however, 19 (30 %) patients remained normocytic and 14 (22 %) patients were nonanemic. ConclusionThe study demonstrates that oral mucosa alterations accompanying oral candidosis are a sensitive <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID.</b> All oral changes can be successfully ameliorated by iron therapy plus antifungals when candidosis exists.

40|$|MSc (Nutrition), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background The {{potential}} {{dire consequences}} of iron deficiency (ID) and {{iron deficiency anaemia}} (IDA) on childhood development are of major public health concern. Many factors contribute to anaemia, ID being only one progressive factor. The prevalence of ID and IDA must be accurately determined before iron intervention strategies can be safely prescribed. There is continued uncertainty regarding the optimal approach to identifying and measuring <b>ID,</b> as <b>indicators</b> have different roles, explore different aspects of iron metabolism and cannot be directly compared. Furthermore, inflammation and infection have a confounding effect on the commonly applied indicator and acute phase reactant, serum ferritin (SF). In the public health setting, a suitable method to assess iron status in developing countries has to be inexpensive, standardised, established, easy to measure and its applications specific to identifying ID. Aim We conducted secondary analysis of screening data from three independent iron intervention studies to critically evaluate the indicators used to determine iron status in 6 - 11 -year-old primary school children from three South African provinces. Study design and methods A cross-sectional descriptive analysis {{was performed on the}} screening data collected in 2009 and 2010 during iron intervention studies in KwaZulu-Natal (n= 736), Northern Cape (n= 1045), and North West (n= 546). The three distinct study sites were analysed independently and collectively. Children’s haemoglobin (Hb), SF, transferrin receptor (TfR), zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured and body iron calculated. ID prevalence was compared using different methods (namely the single indicators SF, TfR and ZPP, body iron and the multiple criteria model), and the influence of inflammation on SF was considered. Literature suggests that the multiple criteria model provides a more complete assessment of iron status. The performance of single and body iron indicators were compared to the multiple criteria model (by assessing sensitivity, specificity and predictive values). Results Significant positive correlations between CRP (indicator of inflammation) and SF existed in all study sites and the combined sample (p < 0. 01). The mean SF concentration was substantially higher in subjects with inflammation than those without. A different SF cut-off to identify ID was applied to subjects with inflammation. The percentage of ID subjects varied using different indicators (4. 2 – 26. 5 % in KwaZulu-Natal; 4. 1 – 13. 4 % in Northern Cape; 7. 0 – 24. 4 % in North West; and 5. 4 – 15. 2 % in the combined sample). The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of alternate <b>ID</b> <b>indicators</b> varied within and between study sites, compared to the multiple criteria model. Conclusion Simply using Hb as an <b>ID</b> <b>indicator</b> is inaccurate. The vast differences between percentages identified as <b>ID</b> by different <b>indicators</b> is reason for concern. No consistent agreement appeared between single <b>ID</b> <b>indicators,</b> body iron and the multiple criteria model for ID identification after correcting for inflammation in primary school children. The global view of the multiple criteria model as the gold standard for estimating ID is debatable and potentially impractical at a public health level. Current evidence cautions against overestimating the prevalence of ID, as there is more associated harm than deficiency underestimation. This critical analysis has confirmed a need for research to identify a suitable, accurate and precise alternative to Hb as a tool in the South African public health setting. Furthermore, the impact of inflammation on iron status indicators, in particular SF, should be assessed in context to clearly set parameters for its use in nationally-representative nutrition surveys, the cornerstone of iron intervention strategies.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of iron deficiency (ID) among non-pregnant, reproductive-age US women significantly exceeds rates among males. In clinical practice ID screening relies on hemoglobin, a late-stage <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID.</b> As a single, low-cost laboratory test to diagnose ID before anemia develops is lacking, the study {{objective was to}} improve ID screening by identifying risk factors among non-anemic, iron-deficient reproductive age women. Cross-sectional data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 - 2010. Hemoglobin identified non-anemic women. ID was defined using the body iron formula, requiring ferritin and transferrin receptor values. Logistic regression assessed the association of sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive risk factors in an anemia-based conceptual framework with non-anemic reproductive age women (12 - 49 years) with ID, as well as subsets of younger (12 - 21 years) and older (22 - 49 years) women, recognizing that risks may differ by age. Among 6216 women, 494 had ID (prevalence was 8. 0 %, 95 % CI 7. 3 %, 8. 6 %). Among non-anemic younger women, 250 (8. 7 %, 95 % CI 7. 7 %, 9. 8 %) had ID, compared to 244 (7. 3 %, 95 % CI 6. 4 %, 8. 2 %) older women. Among younger women, menstruation for over 3 years was the only variable significantly associated with non-anemic ID (risk ratio 3. 18, 95 % CI 2. 03, 4. 96). No other significant risk factors were identified. Menstrual years was the only risk factor significantly associated with ID among non-anemic younger women.

The most suitable assay to detect iron deficiency in the presence of inflammation has not yet been defined. An <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID</b> unaffected by inflammation is needed, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) may be such an indicator. Objective To evaluate ID as a risk factor for febrile seizures in children with inflammation by sTfR measurements. Method We conducted an age-matched, case-control study, focused on children experiencing on acute illnesses at the time. Subjects were 80 children matched by age (40 in the case group with febrile seizures, and 40 in the control group who were febrile without seizures) aged 3 months to 5 years in Mohammad Hoesin Hospital, Palembang from February to August 2013. Subjects’ clinical data and sTfR levels were recorded. Risk factors were analyzed with odd ratios and 95 % confident intervals. The sTfR level cut-off point as a predictor of febrile seizures was also defined. Other risk factors were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression test. Results Mean sTfR levels were 41. 36 (SD 2. 04) nmol/L in the case group and 33. 09 (SD 1. 02) nmol/L in the control group. Multivariate analysis revealed ID and iron deficient anemia (IDA), as measured by sTfR levels, to be risk factors for febrile seizures (adjusted OR= 3. 9; 95 %CI 1. 41 to 10. 8; P= 0. 007 and OR 3. 27; 95 %CI 1. 21 to 8. 84; P= 0. 017, respectively).

40|$|Hemoglobin {{and zinc}} {{protoporphyrin}} (ZPP) tests {{are commonly used}} to screen for iron deficiency, but {{little research has been}} done to systematically evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these two tests. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of zinc protoporphyrin/heme (ZPP/H) ratio as a point-of-service screening test for iron deficiency among preschool-aged children by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of hemoglobin, ZPP/H ratio, and serum ferritin (SF). Also completed were assessments for the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency (ID), and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with indicators of ferritin models. This study was carried out with 95 children ages 3 to 6 y. Anthropometric measurements were assessed, and blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin, SF, transferrin saturation (TS), and ZPP. Anemia was common and the prevalences of anemia, ID, and IDA were 14. 7 %, 12. 6 %, and 5. 2 %, respectively. The ZPP/H ratio was strongly and significantly correlated with hemoglobin. And ZPP/H ratio was a more sensitive test for ID than hemoglobin or SF measurement, correctly identifying more than twice as many iron-deficient children (sensitivity of 91. 7 %, compared to 41. 7 % for hemoglobin and SF). However, ZPP/H ratio had lower specificity (60. 2 %, compared to 89. 1 % for hemoglobin or 96. 4 % for SF) and resulted in the false identification of more subjects who actually were not iron deficient than did hemoglobin or SF. Low hemoglobin concentration is a late-stage <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID,</b> but ZPP/H ratio can detect ID at early stages and can be performed easily at a relatively low cost. Therefore, ZPP/H ratio can serve as a potential screening test for pre-anemic iron deficiency in community pediatric practices...|$|R

The techniques for removing these substances from the subsurface environment is constantly being tuned and revised, and as such, the need for monitoring at such remediation sites is crucial. To find important correlations and hidden patterns between variables principle component analyses (PCA) and correlations matrixes were used on sets of field data from an existing remediation site in southern Sweden. Four important components were extracted in the following order; End products of dechlorination (EPD), second wave of dechlorination (SWD), first wave of dechlorination (FWD) and <b>indicators</b> of dechlorination (<b>ID).</b> The underlying pattern found in the data set was most likely derived from thermodynamic preference, explaining important correlations such as the correlation between iron and sulfate, the correlation between redox and degree of dechlorination.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{addition}} to structural domains, most eukaryotic proteins possess intrinsically disordered (ID) regions. Although ID regions often play important functional roles, their accurate identification is difficult. As human transcription factors (TFs) constitute a typical group of proteins with long ID regions, we regarded {{them as a}} model of all proteins and attempted to accurately classify TFs into structural domains and ID regions. Although an extremely high fraction of ID regions besides DNA binding and/or other domains was detected in human TFs in our previous investigation, 20 % of the residues were left unassigned. In this report, we exploit the generally higher sequence divergence in ID regions than in structural regions to completely divide proteins into structural domains and ID regions. Results The new dichotomic system first identifies domains of known structures, followed by assignment of structural domains and ID regions with a combination of pre-existing tools and a newly developed program based on sequence divergence, taking un-aligned regions into consideration. The system was found to be highly accurate: its application to a set of proteins with experimentally verified ID regions had an error rate as low as 2 %. Application of this system to human TFs (401 proteins) showed that 38 % of the residues were in structural domains, while 62 % were in ID regions. The preponderance of ID regions makes a sharp contrast to TFs of Escherichia coli (229 proteins), in which only 5 % fell in ID regions. The method also revealed that 4. 0 % and 11. 8 % of the total length in human and E. coli TFs, respectively, are comprised of structural domains whose structures have not been determined. Conclusion The present system verifies that sequence divergence including information of unaligned regions is a good <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID</b> regions. The system for the first time estimates the complete fractioning of structured/un-structured regions in human TFs, also revealing structural domains without homology to known structures. These predicted novel structural domains are good targets of structural genomics. When applied to other proteins, the system is expected to uncover more novel structural domains. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Efforts {{to improve}} {{maternal}} nutrition during pregnancy prompted an observational {{study of the}} occurrence of maternal iron deficiency and its laboratory diagnosis in almost 500 pregnancies. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, the biochemical and haematological iron indices of women (n= 492) attending a prenatal clinic in a Dublin maternity hospital were assessed at first booking (mean 15. 9 weeks), and after 24 weeks, and 36 weeks of gestation. Full blood counts were measured. Serum ferritin (SF), zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), and transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations were assayed and transferrin receptor index (sTfR-Index) was calculated. The occurrence of low values and their diagnostic values were considered. RESULTS: A high occurrence iron deficiency (ID) at first booking (SF< 12 mug/L) had increased over six-fold by 24 weeks, and all biochemical iron indices reflected progressive iron depletion right up to term. The WHO recommended anaemia "cut-off" (Hb< 110 g/L) was insensitive to biochemical iron deficiency at booking, missing over 90 % of the low SF values (SF< 12 mug/L) which were mostly associated with much higher Hb levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study {{stresses the importance of}} including a biochemical index of iron status in prenatal screening and supports SF as the best <b>indicator</b> of biochemical <b>ID</b> overall. sTfR was insensitive to iron deficiency in early pregnancy, whereas the sTfR-Index, as a ratio, has the potential to distinguish between ID and physiological anaemia, and may offer stability in the assessment of iron stores from early pregnancy to full term. A policy of early screening of both Hb and SF concentrations is recommended as the minimum requirement for surveillance of maternal iron status in pregnancy...|$|R

Background: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine treatment of iron deficiency (ID) due to its potential adverse neurodevelopmental consequences. Optimal testing to diagnose ID without anemia remains unclear. Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) {{has been found to be}} a valid and inexpensive <b>indicator</b> of <b>ID</b> but is not routinely collected in clinical practices. Evidence suggests that low-income children are at high risk for ID. Objective: To 1) describe the prevalence of ID as measured by ZPP in a low-income population, 2) describe the natural history of ZPP over time, and 3) examine the relationship between iron prescription and ZPP and implications for screening. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of data from the electronic medical records at Boston Medical Center from 1 / 1 / 02 to 12 / 31 / 10. Children with a baseline CBC drawn between age 8 - 18 months and routine screening results for CBC, lead, and ZPP at baseline and follow-up within 2 years were included. Children with sickle cell disease or elevated lead value (≥ 10 mcg/dL) were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between iron prescription and ZPP at follow-up. Results: Ofthe 2612 eligible children, 79 % were publicly insured and 65 % were Black. Overall, 48 % of these children had an abnormal ZPP level (≥ 35 mcg/dL). Among those with an abnormal ZPP at baseline (n= 1254), 18 % were prescribed iron. Improvement in ZPP was found in both groups. Iron prescription was significantly associated with improvement in ZPP (OR 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 0) and greater mean change in ZPP (p= 0. 01). In the multivariate analysis, the effect of iron prescription on improvement in ZPP was modified by hemoglobin level. Among those with abnormal ZPP and anemia at baseline (n= 189), interim iron prescription was significantly associated with ZPP improvement at follow-up (aOR 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 5. 0). Among children without anemia, iron was rarely prescribed and no significant association with ZPP improvement was found. Conclusions: ID, as measured by elevated ZPP, was common in this low-income population, the majority of whom showed improvement at follow-up. Iron prescription was significantly associated with ZPP improvement. Our data suggest that ZPP may be an appropriate method for screening for ID and monitoring response to therapy...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{field of}} digital disease detection, or epidem-ic intelligence, {{attempts}} to improve timely detection {{and awareness of}} infectious disease (ID) events. Early detection remains an important priority; thus, the next frontier for ID surveillance {{is to improve the}} recognition and monitoring of drivers (antecedent conditions) of ID emergence for signals that precede disease events. These data could help alert public health officials to <b>indicators</b> of elevated <b>ID</b> risk, thereby triggering targeted active surveillance and interventions. We believe that ID emergence risks can be anticipated through surveillance of their drivers, just as successful warning sys-tems of climate-based, meteorologically sensitive diseases are supported by improved temperature and precipitation data. We present approaches to driver surveillance, gaps in the current literature, and a scientific framework {{for the creation of a}} digital warning system. Fulfilling the promise of driver surveillance will require concerted action to expand the collection of appropriate digital driver data. Unusual infectious disease (ID) events occur when an underlying mix of antecedent epidemiologic drivers provide the necessary conditions for a pathogen to emerge in susceptible populations. These conditions may be driv-ing emergence through a wide variety of mechanisms, such as climate change, industrial development, ecosys-tem change, and social inequality (1). Public health policy has traditionally targeted well-described socioeconomic drivers, such as lack of sanitation, lack of hygiene aware-ness, and poor access to health care and disease preven-tion services (e. g., bed nets, vaccinations, and treatments), but researchers have increasingly evaluated the complex interactions among drivers related to globalization, politi-cal issues, human susceptibility, and biophysical environ-mental change (1 – 8) (Table). Whereas early ID research primarily focused on pathogen identification and specific disease ecologies (9), researchers are now exploring the multifactorial causes of emergence. No longer is the question “What causes Ebo-la? ” but rather, “Why does an Ebola outbreak occur at a particular time or location? ” As a result of this transition in research, global disease event data have grown.

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} (ID) {{during pregnancy}} {{has been recognized}} as {{a major cause of}} hypothyroidism and adverse health consequences in both mothers and children. Although urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in school-aged children is recommended as an <b>indicator</b> to assess <b>ID</b> in the general population, {{it may not be a}} good surrogate for directly assessing iodine status in pregnant women. Iodine supplementation of mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women has been recommended worldwide; however, long-term benefit and safety of iodine supplementation in this group is uncertain. Finally, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) may negatively affect thyroid function and pregnancy outcomes.          Objectives: 1) to measure UIC in pairs of pregnant women and their school-aged children living in the same household; 2) to investigate the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function, pregnancy and birth outcomes, and newborn development; 3) to evaluate the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG with thyroid function and pregnancy outcomes. Methods: 1) In a cross-sectional pilot study, UIC was measured in spot urine samples from pairs (n= 302) of healthy pregnant mothers and their school-aged children in Bangkok; 2) Arandomized controlled trial was conducted with 200 µg iodine per day or placebo given to mildly ID pregnant Thai women from 500 µg/L. Maternal thyroid function, thyroid volume and the prevalence of all thyroid dysfunction subtypes did not differ significantly between treatment groups during the study (p> 0. 05). At 6 -week postpartum, the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis (hyperthyroidism) was significantly lower in the iodine group (3 %) as compared to the placebo group (9 %) (OR: 95 %CI, 0. 17 : 0. 04 - 0. 70). There were no significant differences between newborn groups in thyroid function, thyroid volume, birth characteristics, UIC and NBAS score (p> 0. 05); 3) Pre-pregnancy BMI was a negative predictor of free thyroxine (fT 4) (β=- 0. 20, P< 0. 001) in early gestation (< 14 weeks). Compared to normal weight women, the prevalence ratio (95 % CI) of a low fT 4 in overweight women was 3. 64 (2. 08 – 6. 37) (P< 0. 01). In addition, secondary data analysis showed that overweight women had an 11 -fold higher risk of delivering a large for gestational age infant compared to normal weight women, while women who had excessive GWG were 5. 6 times more likely to deliver a macrosomic infant compared to women with normal GWG. Conclusion: 1) UIC in school-aged children should not be used as a surrogate for monitoring iodine status in pregnancy; 2) iodine supplementation (200 µg/d) in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant Thai women was effective in increasing iodine intakes into the adequate range but had no benefit on antenatal maternal thyroid function or newborn outcomes out to 6 weeks; however, it significantly reduced the risk of maternal postpartum thyroid dysfunction; 3) excess maternal body weight both before and during pregnancy may have adverse impacts on maternal thyroid function as well as birth weight. Therefore, maintaining normal body weight before and throughout pregnancy should be recommended...|$|R
