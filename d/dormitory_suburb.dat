5|$|The {{streets in}} Yarralumla are named after Australian {{governors}} and botanists. Most {{of the older}} streets in the suburb are laid out on an approximately rectangular grid with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburb,</b> there are no major through roads. Access {{to the rest of}} the city can be made from Adelaide Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street.|$|E

50|$|The {{valley is}} {{experiencing}} increasing urbanisation at both its {{eastern and western}} extremities. As commuters move into the area, its towns are becoming <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> and satellite towns of the Brisbane-Ipswich conurbation {{in the east and}} Toowoomba in the west. Urban planning measures have been implemented to preserve the good quality agricultural land and rural feel of the valley. Such measures largely confine future development to non-arable land on the slopes of the hills.|$|R
50|$|This {{early and}} {{prolonged}} reconfiguration of the American, and Australian, city around private transportation served to dramatically alter {{the course of}} city development within these countries. This is made most tangible through the generally accepted shape the man-made environment has taken {{in cities such as}} Melbourne, Los Angeles and Detroit, which cater to the needs of automobile ownership (i.e. sidewalks, grid city layout linked with <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs,</b> highways and private transport corridors, and the securing of land for car spaces).|$|R

J&J White's Chemical Works (later ACC Chrome & Chemicals) in Shawfield, {{which was in}} existence from 1820 to 1967, produced more than 70% of the UK's Chromate products including chromic acid, chromic oxide pigment, sodium and potassium chromate and dichromate. Today {{there is a significant}} legacy of soluble chromium (VI) waste in the area. Rutherglen, and most of the other towns encircling the city, are <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|Pinner is a London Underground {{station on}} the Metropolitan line in zone 5. The station was opened in 1885 {{as part of the}} Victorian {{expansion}} of <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs,</b> {{and was one of the}} stations included in the Metro-land project in the early 20th century. The site is served by several bus routes including links to the Hatch End railway station which was known as Pinner & Hatch End prior to 1920. Step free facilities were opened in 2008. Its adjacent stations are Northwood Hills (northbound) and North Harrow (southbound).|$|R
50|$|This part of Spring Hill was {{surveyed}} officially into suburban allotments in 1856, and {{was soon}} subdivided for closer residential settlement by speculative land owners. Along with Kangaroo Point and Petrie Terrace, Spring Hill was among the earliest of Brisbane's <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs,</b> attracting middle class residents to the high land along the ridges, and the working class to the hollows in between: Hanly's Hollow (between Wickham Terrace and Leichhardt Street), Spring Hollow (between Leichhardt Street and Gregory Terrace), and York's Hollow (to the north of Gregory Terrace - an area occupied {{by a number of}} brick-makers in the 1850s and 1860s).|$|R

50|$|North Tyneside {{lies in the}} {{coalfield}} {{that covers}} the South-East of the historic county of Northumberland. It has traditionally been a centre of heavy industry {{along with the rest}} of Tyneside, with for example the Swan Hunter shipyard in Wallsend, and export of coal. Today most of the heavy industry has gone, leaving high unemployment in some areas (over the borough, 3.2% compared to 2.7% for the UK). The borough is the 69th most deprived in England, out of 354. However some parts function as wealthy <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Newcastle, such as Tynemouth. Recent growth has come in the A19 corridor with new industrial estates and retail parks.|$|R
50|$|Despite these initiatives, housing {{standards}} in Sweden were low. After the Second World War a massive building project was undertaken {{to satisfy the}} housing shortage and improve standards. In 1965 the government announced the Million Programme — {{the building of a}} million new dwellings within ten years (with a population of 7.8 million). Entire <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> were built within a very short time. Land in many city centre areas was purchased and replanned in a modern and functional way to make room for offices. The enormous building projects were planned and led by large architects' offices. Often the quality of buildings and their design were of secondary importance to the delivery of such large numbers of projects.|$|R
50|$|Australian {{cities and}} urban centres, {{particularly}} capital cities, experienced significant growth after World War II, which was largely {{driven by a}} combination of rapid economic expansion, high birth rates and unparalleled levels of immigration, particularly from western Europe and, from the 1970s, south east Asia. Furthermore, increasing ownership of the motor car, combined with cheap fuel, resulted in an explosion in the urban form of many Australian urban centres. Many cities were rapidly transformed from modest, medium density centres, supported by public transport, to a suburban, car dominated city with large, residential <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs.</b> As a consequence, population and land use become increasingly dispersed. For example, in 1840 40% of Sydney's residents lived in suburbs, while by the 1960s this figure had risen to over 70%.|$|R

40|$|Pubblica (lit. Public Residential Construction), {{undergone}} {{over the}} last sixty years in Italy, have brought about new lines of thought with regard to places to live. The high cost of renewal and re-functionalization of the E. R. P. areas, the absence of services, which have transformed them into <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs,</b> have led us to rethink new urban environments as places possessing a sense of identity, in which to provide communal services and spaces for neighborly relations. Moreover, the social, economic and political dynamics {{of the last few}} years have modified not only life styles, but also the typology of householder, ever more sensitive to the quality of product and environmental issues. This contribution discusses several principles as a point of departure for a new Social Housing...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{residential}} sprawl and accompanying car dependence has become irreversible, {{to the point}} where the case for further investment in expensive urban public transport systems has been undermined. Investments in facilities such as LUAS are taking place in parts of the Greater Dublin Area with static or declining population. Bus-based public transport looks much better value for our capital city. At the same time, the Government’s planned decentralisation of 10, 300 public sector jobs will simply add to the existing rapid population growth of many towns - some of which are already <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> for Dublin - and will do nothing to reduce car dependency.

40|$|Home based {{businesses}} (HBB) {{are increasingly}} becoming {{an alternative to}} salaried employment. This research explores the potential for HBB to contribute significantly to the economic development of peripheral metropolitan centres. Without economic development, these centres remain <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs</b> with unresolved associated social and ecological issues. By mapping the diversity and limitations of HBB in the City of Casey, an outer suburban peripheral area of Melbourne, Australia, this study aims to evaluate what exists and the response by governments at all levels to further business development. This study finds {{that the role of}} government is restricted to broad initial start-ups, with no programs or support for the type of innovative HBB that need to be husbanded and encouraged to grow outside of the narrow confines of their home base...|$|R

50|$|However, many {{of these}} suburbs had turned into <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs,</b> a problem thought to be avoided in Vällingby by {{planning}} for approximately 10,000 work places for the 20-25.000 inhabitants, while the metro was {{to provide access to}} the commercial centre to some 80,000 people. Important influences came from the United Kingdom where both Labour and the Tories launched ambitious welfare programmes. The original plan for the area was designed by architect Sven Markelius who placed high-rise buildings near the metro stations with peripheral self-contained houses and green areas around it. While the Social Democrats are widely acknowledged for the realisation of Vällingby, other political parties and, not the least, private entrepreneurs actively took part in the planning process. Additionally, Vällingby became an important piece of propaganda used to spread an image of harmonic Swedish welfare all over the world.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about researching methods/testing {{approaches}} to inhabiting/existing in a post-growth Norrland, the collective term for Sweden’s most northerly counties. With neo-liberal capitalism lurching from crisis to crisis, modernity, progress {{and the state}} are in trouble. Small shops close, iconic buildings are constructed, agriculture, the most vital of industries, is collapsing and competition is the watchword. If peak-oil, the consumer culture and individualism combine to lead us into a dystopian slough, what is the alternative? This work aims to investigate and show the existing conditions that are producing {{the current state of}} affairs in Norrland, with emphasis on Röbäck, one of Umeå’s agricultural satellites cum <b>dormitory</b> <b>suburbs.</b> This research will provide the necessities for dreamed proposals about a possible post-growth future, integrating alternative views of technology and modes of living with the ethos of the common and our use of shared resources...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{section of}} Mountview House, a two-storeyed stone residence, {{is believed to}} have been erected in the 1860s for Brisbane foreman carpenter Daniel McNaught.
