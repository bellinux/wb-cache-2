25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for {{the thrust of the}} ideas he goes on to develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork is to prepare a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E

If he did not know of the nonconformity at acceptance, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> revoke <b>only</b> if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> prove <b>he</b> was reasonably induced by the difficulty of discovering the defect or by the seller's assurances. The buyer can revoke if (1) it occurs within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered; (2) before any substantial change in the goods not caused by their own defects; and (3) not effective until the buyer notifies the seller he is going to revoke. Upon revocation, the buyer can then cancel the contract and compel refund of the purchase price of the goods. In some states, the courts allow the seller to set off the price for the time the buyer kept the goods before the revocation.|$|R

Strange News from Another Star tells of the horror experienced by this youth who has volunteered to go to find flowers to bury the dead from an earthquake; flowers that are required during the ceremony of the burial of the dead, in this young man's world, to ease a smooth transition into the next life. In order to speed his journey, he is carried across the mountains by this giant bird, but finds himself in a land where war has left the dead unburied and uncared for, a brutal world, perhaps {{like that of the}} trenches of World War I, a world that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> believe is from his distant past.
