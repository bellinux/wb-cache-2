5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to <b>know</b> <b>everyone</b> else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an application}} of the S- 4 logic. There are two aims in this paper. Aim 1 is to check the relation between our model and the S- 4 logic. We 11 see the soundness and completeness of the S- 4 logic {{with respect to the}} model by using the concept of structure. Aim 2 is to prove avariation of no trade theorem in the model. 1 Introduction The word “knowledge ” and especialy “common knowledge ” plays avery important role in game theory.
