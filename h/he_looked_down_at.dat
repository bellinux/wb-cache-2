500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the setlist taped {{to the body of}} the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure {{he was going to do}} it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
2500|$|Henri Pélissier was {{the first}} French winner of the Tour de France since 1911, and ended a series of seven Belgian victories. Desgrange, {{who had been in}} a fight with Pélissier for three years, wrote [...] "The {{mountains}} seemed to sink lower, sunk by the victorious thrust of his muscle. More than a score of times on the most vicious gradients, hands on the tops of the bars, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the valley bottoms, like an eagle staring at his prey". The French victory was good for the organising newspaper l'Auto: the circulation increased to almost half a million copies, while it peaked at one million the morning after Pélissier's victory.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his feet, thoughtfully {{considering}} the proposition.|$|E
60|$|When she {{got home}} she was hurried up at once to her mother's room,--and there she found her father, alone. 'This is your game, is it?' said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... [At {{his slow}} gait, with his feeble smile, he comes in, and [...] {{standing}} by the window-seat beside the long dark coat that still [...] lies there, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> STRANGWAY with his lost eyes.] ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, she <b>looks</b> up at him, and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; {{my lungs}} is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is {{rattling}} dry!’ and coughs in confirmation horribly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her face, luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his table-desk, {{fingering}} the starry enameled vase.|$|E
60|$|Unclasping {{his arms}} and {{stepping}} back, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> himself.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} on a stool before the hearth, and {{clasping}} her fingers upon her knee looked thoughtfully into the embers of the fire. Presently she began to speak in a low, even voice, <b>he</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, his feet apart, his hand thrust backward towards the heat.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed a}} little, boyishly, as <b>he</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sad," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her; [...] "no, {{certainly}} not sad." [...] Her sweet, loving eyes were turned towards him, {{and she smiled}} softly as he answered her. The temptation was too strong even for the demure propriety of Mr. Arabin, and bending over her, he pressed his lips to hers.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ground, {{his voice}} tailing off into silence.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{his voice}} faltered somewhat, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a quick frown. Decidedly he was annoyed.|$|E

5000|$|So we {{get home}} and Tom's playing the vintage drum kit he'd bought way before we ever went to L.A. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bass drum and {{scratched}} on there is, 'El Dorado.' I swear to God, none of us did it. It had been there the whole time. It was the curse of El Dorado!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lydia smiled; but <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, {{did not see}} {{the smile}} because of her coronet of red hair, which seemed to flame in the sunlight. The {{obstruction}} was unsatisfactory to him; he wanted to see her face. He hesitated, and then sat down on the ground beside her cautiously, as if getting into a very hot bath.|$|R
60|$|Victoria {{glanced at}} him with {{interest}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Meader.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me like {{a father}} gazing tenderly at the wayward child.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a curly {{head and}} a sweet pretty face that he knew.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her thoughtfully. How pretty she had grown; and how {{mature and}} womanly.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry, for a moment, {{was serious}} enough. <b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her a little}} wistfully.|$|R
5000|$|Understatement {{often leads}} to litotes, a rhetorical {{construct}} in which understatement is used to emphasize a point. It is a staple of humour in English-speaking cultures. For example in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, an Army officer has just lost his leg. When asked how <b>he</b> feels, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his bloody stump and responds, [...] "Stings a bit." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her for {{a moment}} as he held her close to him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Ann and was {{surprised}} to see a joyless thoughtfulness upon her face.|$|E
60|$|The colour burned {{once more}} in his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his attire with dissatisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, I don't {{think that}} quite {{everybody}} is the worse," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] "There is one, at least, who is beyond taint, {{one who is}} good, and pure, and true, and who would love me as well if I were a poor clerk struggling for a livelihood. You would, would you not, Laura?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, smiling good-naturedly, {{a trifle}} sarcastically perhaps, and the frown {{on her face}} deepened.|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} speak, and while <b>he</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the mite of humanity, Kendall {{stepped into the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Lingard rose. His face cleared, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the anxious}} Babalatchi with sudden benevolence.|$|E
60|$|The Duke {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his cigar and then {{suddenly}} up again.|$|E
60|$|When {{the doctor}} came {{in some time}} later <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Aynsley before he turned to Ruth.|$|E
5000|$|Ernest: [...] "Spencer Tracy was {{the first}} actor I've seen who could just <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the dirt and command a scene. He played a set-up with Robert Ryan that way. <b>He's</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the road and then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at Ryan at just the precise, right minute. I tell you, Rob could've stood {{on his head and}} zipped open his fly and the scene would've still been Mr. Tracy's." ...|$|R
60|$|His smile faded. <b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her fixedly, as was {{sometimes}} his habit. Grave tenderness {{was in his}} tone.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{was taken}} aback. <b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, {{stroking}} his goatee, and marvelling at {{the ways of}} woman.|$|R
