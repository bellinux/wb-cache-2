The largest crocodile in captivity, {{known locally as}} Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} lakes in the region, and {{cities in the}} area <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> extensive park systems for recreation. Organized recreation includes the Great River Energy bicycle festival, the Twin Cities Marathon, and the U.S. pond hockey championships. Some {{studies have shown that}} area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, medicine is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of Rochester, as the University of Minnesota has joined other colleges and hospitals in doing significant research, and major medical device manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is Medtronic). Technical innovators have brought important advances in computing, including the Cray line of supercomputers.|$|E

[...] Infinite networks that are not constrained by real-world restrictions can <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> unphysical properties. [...] For instance Kirchhoff's laws can fail in some cases and infinite resistor ladders can be defined which have a driving-point impedance which depends on the termination at infinity. [...] Another unphysical property of theoretical infinite networks is that, in general, they will dissipate infinite power unless constraints are placed on them {{in addition to the}} usual network laws such as Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. [...] There are, however, some real-world applications. [...] The transmission line example is one of a class of practical problems that can be modelled by infinitesimal elements (the distributed element model). [...] Other examples are launching waves into a continuous medium, fringing field problems, and measurement of resistance between points of a substrate or down a borehole.|$|E

2500|$|However, it {{is known}} from experiments—most {{prominently}} from observed neutrino oscillations—that neutrinos do in fact <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> small mass, probably less than [...] This implies the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The currently most favoured extension is the so-called seesaw mechanism, which would explain both why the left-handed neutrinos are so light compared to the corresponding charged leptons, and why {{we have not yet}} seen any right-handed neutrinos.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{the real}} numbers with the {{standard}} Lebesgue measure are σ-finite but not finite. Consider the closed intervals [...] for all integers there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line. Alternatively, consider the real numbers with the counting measure, which assigns to each finite set of reals the number of points in the set. This measure space is not σ-finite, because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many points, {{and it would take}} uncountably many such sets to cover the entire real line. The σ-finite measure spaces <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> convenient properties; σ-finiteness can be compared in this respect to the Lindelöf property of topological spaces. They can be also thought of as a vague generalization of the idea that a measure space may have 'uncountable measure'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sport of}} scuba diving {{had its roots}} among the {{multitude}} of small enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just {{before and after the}} Second World War. After the invention of the [...] "aqualung" [...] by Cousteau and Gagnan, the first commercially underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s. As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations – notably the YMCA – began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime and began to codify what were believed to be the proper practises needed for this expanding amateur sport. The buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the [...] "never swim alone" [...] edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of harrowing diving incidents. The buddy system did indeed <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of diver certification during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as NAUI, PADI and BS-AC the practise of buddy diving solidified into one of the two main mantras of the sport: [...] "never hold your breath" [...] and [...] "never dive alone".|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} solo diving goes {{back a long}} way. The concept of buddy diving is {{relatively}} new. Freedivers traditionally dived alone or with a surface attendant {{to assist with the}} harvest. Early diving bells were often only large enough for a single occupant. When surface supplied diving was developed, it was common to only have one diver unless the work to be done required more, and this tradition continues to the present, although there is now usually a standby diver and the working diver is in constant communication with the surface control crew.
