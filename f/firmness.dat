5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and <b>firmness</b> (agraha) engenders and {{therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, <b>firmness</b> and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the <b>firmness</b> of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
25|$|In grading {{lumber and}} {{structural}} timber, knots are classified {{according to their}} form, size, soundness, and the <b>firmness</b> {{with which they are}} held in place. This <b>firmness</b> is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.|$|E
25|$|The {{consistency}} index (CI) indicates the consistency (<b>firmness)</b> of a soil.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{government}} efforts, {{some investors}} {{have criticized the}} government's lack of <b>firmness</b> in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.|$|E
25|$|A third {{generation}} MagneRide suspension system {{is also available}} which works by magnetising iron particles inside the suspension fluid to quickly adapt shock absorber <b>firmness</b> to road changes.|$|E
25|$|Phallus-shaped {{vegetables}} and fruits, such as bananas or zucchini {{have even been}} used as dildos. Any object of sufficient <b>firmness</b> and shape could be hypothetically used as a dildo.|$|E
25|$|Alleging {{problems}} with the <b>firmness</b> of its lateral walls, the parochial church of Cedros was demolished in September 1945, and a new temple constructed: it was consecrated on 18 June 1954.|$|E
25|$|Gold was {{the symbol}} of the divine or {{celestial}} light, the glory of God. Silver was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness. Brass symbolized hardness, strength, and <b>firmness.</b> Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.|$|E
25|$|Salt also {{is added}} to secure the soil and to provide <b>firmness</b> to the {{foundation}} on which highways are built. The salt acts to minimize the effects of shifting caused in the subsurface by changes in humidity and traffic load.|$|E

25|$|Yet Alexander {{could also}} rely on Hephaestion for <b>firmness</b> and resolve. When his {{policies}} {{had led to}} a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.|$|E
25|$|These {{form part}} of the coat of arms of the La Salle family of Rheims, France. There are three bent bars of {{inverted}} V shapes. Chevrons are symbols of <b>firmness</b> and constancy indicating {{that we should have}} ZEAL in carrying out our tasks and the courage never to give up.|$|E
25|$|High-end, {{chrome plated}} steel dildos {{are also popular}} in the BDSM scene. Some users prefer them because of their hardness, <b>firmness,</b> durability, {{electrical}} conductance (see erotic electrostimulation), and low friction, especially when {{used in conjunction with}} lubricant. Because they are heavy, they can be used to exercise vaginal PC muscles.|$|E
25|$|The <b>firmness</b> of the suspension, {{and thus}} {{the quality of the}} ride, was {{gradually}} softened through the years as well, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. Interestingly, a heavy-duty suspension was offered optionally on later first generation Toronados, which included the original torsion bar springs that were used on the 1966.|$|E
25|$|Peach {{breeding}} has favored cultivars {{with more}} <b>firmness,</b> more red color, and shorter fuzz on the fruit surface. These characteristics ease shipping and supermarket sales by improving eye appeal. However, this selection process has not necessarily led to increased flavor. Peaches {{have a short}} shelf life, so commercial growers typically plant a mix of different cultivars to have fruit to ship all season long.|$|E
25|$|Sébastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, {{so it has}} a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of {{this voice}} type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training. Sébastien's voice is {{distinguished}} by its clear and bright timbre, the pectoral resonance and <b>firmness</b> in voice projection. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to B4.|$|E
25|$|While most rice is bred for crop {{quality and}} productivity, there are {{varieties}} selected for {{characteristics such as}} texture, smell, and <b>firmness.</b> There are four major categories of rice worldwide: indica, japonica, aromatic and glutinous. The different varieties of rice are not considered interchangeable, either in food preparation or agriculture, so as a result, each major variety is a completely separate market from other varieties. It is common for one variety of rice to rise in price while another one drops in price.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{directed}} the first Union expedition to Ship Island, off the Mississippi Gulf Coast, in December 1861, and in May 1862 commanded {{the force that}} conducted the capture of New Orleans after its occupation by the Navy following the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. In the administration of that city he showed great <b>firmness</b> and political subtlety. He devised a plan for relief of the poor, demanded oaths of allegiance from anyone who sought any privilege from government, and confiscated weapons.|$|E
25|$|Teddy {{proceeds}} to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with <b>firmness,</b> politely exhorts {{the girl to}} return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.|$|E
25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an {{electric}} power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper <b>firmness.</b> Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|E
25|$|For his <b>firmness</b> and energy, he {{was also}} known as the Exterminator of the Pames of Querétaro. In Nuevo Santander he was accused of murdering the Indians and taking slaves. He faced a court case where he was charged with {{illegally}} using Indian labor in his textile mills and using the port of Santander to bring in English contraband. However, in the period 1770-1775 there were {{more than twice as many}} deaths among the Indians as in the 22 years he governed.|$|E
25|$|Comandante general Simón Elías González, was {{nominated}} governor and military command {{was given to}} Colonel J.J. Calvo, whose <b>firmness</b> had earned well-merited praise. The state {{was in the midst}} of a war with the Apaches, which became the focus of all their energy and resources. After a review of the situation, Simón Elías González declared that the interests of the territory would be best served by uniting the civil and military power, at least while the campaign lasted. He resigned under opposition, but was renominated in 1837.|$|E
25|$|The shape, size, position, symmetry, spacing, <b>firmness,</b> {{and amount}} of sagging of {{individual}} women's breasts vary considerably. Manufacturers' bra size labeling systems vary {{from country to country}} because no international standards exist. Even within a single country, one study found that the bra label size was consistently different from the measured size. As a result, about 25% of women have a difficult time finding a properly fitted bra. Some women choose to buy custom-made bras due to the unusual size or shape of their breasts.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has {{established}} the following grades for Florida oranges, which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit: US Fancy, US No. 1 Bright, US No. 1, US No. 1 Golden, US No. 1 Bronze, US No. 1 Russet, US No. 2 Bright, US No. 2, US No. 2 Russet, and US No. 3. The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), <b>firmness,</b> maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. Fancy, the highest grade, requires the highest grade {{of color and}} an absence of blemishes, while the terms Bright, Golden, Bronze, and Russet concern solely discoloration.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} {{and weight of}} the breast vary widely among women. A small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500grams (1.1 pounds) or less, and a large breast can weigh approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds) or more. The tissue composition ratios of the breast also vary among women. Some women's breasts have varying proportions of glandular tissue than of adipose or connective tissues. The fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density or <b>firmness</b> of the breast. During a woman's life, her breasts change size, shape, and weight due to hormonal changes during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.|$|E
25|$|A Treaty of Friendship {{was signed}} between Italy and Libya in 2008 in Benghazi. The treaty {{provides}} for the closure of colonial contentious, upon investments from Italy for 5 bln € in 20 years in infrastructure in Libya; for the mutual commitment not {{to act in a}} hostile way (criticised as not legally compliant with Italy's NATO obligations). Libyan Dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi subsequently visited Rome in June, July and August 2009, sparkling controversies for his initiatives and speeches. The Berlusconi government was criticised for the lack of <b>firmness</b> toward the Libyan autocracy and the lack of requests of respect of human rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build <b>firmness</b> and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the <b>firmness.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is not}} too much to say that, from the end of 1759 to the end of 1761, the unshakable <b>firmness</b> of the Russian Empress was the one {{constraining}} political force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and {{that the only way to}} bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of a Prince-Elector.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen {{alone or in}} combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and <b>firmness</b> and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.|$|E
25|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor, {{as well as}} the progesterone receptor, {{have been}} detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, <b>firmness,</b> and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased ground substance between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging.|$|E
