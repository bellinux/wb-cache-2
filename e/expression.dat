40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to survey the {{presence}} of folk <b>expressions,</b> i. e. proverbs, proverbial <b>expressions,</b> wellerisms and familiar <b>expressions,</b> {{in some of the}} realistic children’s books by Astrid Lindgren. The purpose also includes the study of the contextual and pragmatic functions of the <b>expressions</b> as well as how the <b>expressions</b> are integrated into the text by the change of the formulaic standard structure. The contextual and pragmatic function concern when, how and why the <b>expressions</b> are used and who the users of the <b>expressions</b> are. The questions at issue are: What kind of folk <b>expressions</b> occur in the children’s books by Astrid Lindgren? What contextual and pragmatic functions do the <b>expressions</b> have? How are the <b>expressions</b> integrated into the text? To be able to answer the questions, folk <b>expressions</b> were excerpted from the books with the help of close reading. The contextual and pragmatic functions of the <b>expressions</b> were determined by analysing the communicative context, the senders and the receivers of the <b>expressions,</b> the senders’ purpose in using the <b>expressions.</b> Furthermore, the changes {{in the structure of the}} <b>expressions</b> were analysed in order to determine how the <b>expressions</b> were integrated into the text. The result shows that the 52 folk <b>expressions</b> found in general are used in dialogues between adults as senders and children as receivers. The senders use the <b>expressions</b> mainly to comment on anything or anyone with the purpose to explain, i. e. a didactic purpose. The majority of the <b>expressions</b> have not changed their formulaic standard structure, and the <b>expressions</b> that have changed are used as allusions, paraphrases or ellipses of folk <b>expressions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Reduced {{function}} of NMDA receptors {{play a role}} in schizophrenia. This diminished {{function of}} NMDA receptor may be correlated with the reduced <b>expression</b> of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2b), which has also been linked to schizophrenia. TBR1, in complex with the protein, CINAP, is responsible for regulating transcription of the NR2b gene. It was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced TBR1 and CINAP <b>expression</b> may be responsible for the reduced <b>expression</b> of the NR2b subunit observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics. However, TBR1 and CINAP <b>expression</b> were not significantly reduced in the postmortem brains, suggesting that synthesis and processing of NR2b via TBR1 is not responsible for reduced NR2b <b>expression</b> in schizophrenics.|$|E

This paper gives an outline of comparative <b>expressions</b> and additional <b>expressions</b> with those two directionals.

40|$|Most {{research}} on facial <b>expressions</b> focuses on static, ‘emotional’ <b>expressions.</b> Facial <b>expressions,</b> however, {{are also important}} in interpersonal communication (‘conversational’ <b>expressions).</b> In addition, communication is a highly dynamic phenomenon and previous evidence suggests that dynamic presentation of stimuli facilitates recognition. Hence, we examined the categorization of emotional and conversational <b>expressions</b> using both static and dynamic stimuli. In a between-subject design, 40 {{participants were asked to}} group 55 dierent facial <b>expressions</b> (either static or dynamic) of ten actors in a free categorization task. <b>Expressions</b> were to be grouped according to their overall similarity. The resulting confusion matrix was used to determine the consistency with which facial <b>expressions</b> were categorized. In the static condition, emotional <b>expressions</b> were grouped as separate categories while participants confused conversational <b>expressions.</b> In the dynamic condition, participants uniquely categorized basic and sub-ordinate emotional, as well as several conversational facial <b>expressions.</b> Furthermore, a multidimensional scaling analysis suggests that the same potency and valence dimensions underlie the categorization of both static and dynamic <b>expressions.</b> Basic emotional <b>expressions</b> represent the most eective categories when only static information is available. Importantly, however, our results show that dynamic information allows for a much more fine-grained categorization and is essential in disentangling conversational <b>expressions...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that Japanese {{conditional}} <b>expressions</b> often require particular modal <b>expressions</b> in the sentence-final position.

This fact may cast doubts about the generality of the "conception level" often used in the study of the Japanese conditional <b>expressions.</b> In addition, by contrasting Japanese and Ainu, it is shown that yakun is the most important among the Ainu conditional <b>expressions</b> since it has extremely wider usage corresponding to that of at least three different conditional <b>expressions</b> of Japanese. 北大文学研究科北方研究教育センター公開シンポジウム「サハリンの言語世界」. 平成 20 年 9 月 6 日. 札幌...|$|R

Using our definition of frozen <b>expressions</b> we assembled 4798 frozen <b>expressions</b> which we classified using lexical and semantic criteria.

Examples of subcategories for the positive dimension were those frozen <b>expressions</b> which expressed abundance, success, knowledge, etc., and for the negative dimension those frozen <b>expressions</b> which express failure, difficulties, rage, disinterest, death, etc. We found that the frozen <b>expressions</b> with negative dimension had more subcategories and outnumbered the frozen <b>expressions</b> with positive dimension.
