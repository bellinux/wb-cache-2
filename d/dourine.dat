50|$|Τrypanosoma equiperdum is {{a species}} of {{excavate}} parasites that causes <b>Dourine</b> or covering sickness in horses and other animals in the family equidae. Genetic analyses have revealed T. equiperdum to be a derivative of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis. Unlike T. brucei, T. equiperdum is spread primarily via sexual transmission, an adaptation that has allowed it to escape beyond {{the range of the}} tsetse fly and attain a cosmopolitan distribution. Mother-foal transmission has also been documented. Τhe donkey shows no symptoms but is a carrier of this parasite. Can be found in genital organs and secretions.|$|E
5000|$|This {{lack of a}} cure or {{vaccine is}} a {{definite}} problem in the equine industry, especially in developing countries where equines are highly valuable for both agriculture and transportation. <b>Dourine</b> is considered an endemic problem in developing countries, where over sixty percent of equines {{in the world are}} located. The protocol for this disease, as stated by OIE, currently stands at slaughter of seropositive animals. [...] This is not an economically feasible option for many people who depend on horses for their livelihood. Therefore, it is crucial to continue research in this field and develop a viable vaccine.|$|E
5000|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America [...] ), <b>dourine</b> and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions [...] "assassin bug", [...] "cone-nose bug", and [...] "kissing bug") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dourine</b> is {{a unique}} disease {{in the sense that}} it has no known vectors or fomites {{existing}} in the natural world, other than members of the equine family, including donkeys, mules, and horses. [...] In a laboratory setting, Trypanosoma equiperdum has been manipulated to adapt to and proliferate in other species, such as dogs, rabbits, mice and rats, but this has never been observed to occur naturally and without scientific manipulation. Although this limits spread of the disease because it is restricted to the equine population alone, the organism has developed complex mechanisms over time to better equip itself for prolonged survival in the equine species. This parasite efficiently evades the host animal's immune system through the use of variable surface glycoproteins or VSGs. These VSGs allow the organism to constantly manipulate and change the surface structure of its proteins, which means it is constantly being presented to the immune system as a new foreign organism and this prevents the body from mounting a large enough immune response to eradicate the disease. In this sense, Trypanosoma equiperdum is a very efficient organism; it may infect less species than other diseases, but it infects and survives very efficiently within its specified hosts.|$|E
5000|$|An {{article in}} The Saturday Evening Post, {{published}} on April 17, 1954, while Reckless {{was still in}} Korea, resulted in a campaign by American supporters to get the Marines to bring her to the United States. An executive at Pacific Transport Lines, Stan Coppel, read the article and offered to let Reckless ride free {{on one of his}} company's ships from Yokohama to San Francisco. Prior to her departure for America, a ceremony, including a band, for Reckless' rotation to the United States was held during half time of a football game between the Marine Corps and Army. Reckless left Korea for Japan aboard a 1st Marine Aircraft Wing transport plane. She then sailed from Yokohama on October 22 aboard the SS Pacific Transport, due in San Francisco on November 5, 1954. A typhoon delayed the ship's arrival until the evening of November 9. Reckless and her caretakers stayed aboard until the next morning. Reckless got sick during the storm and was once knocked out of her stall onto the deck by the storm, which happened {{near the end of the}} trip. [...] I was surprised at her beauty and intelligence, and believe it or not, her esprit de corps. Like any other Marine, she was enjoying a bottle of beer with her comrades.

40|$|Classification of the causative agent <b>Dourine</b> is a {{parasitic}} {{venereal disease}} of equines {{caused by the}} flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma equiperdum of the order Trypanosomatida. Variable strain pathogenicity has been described but, for unknown reasons, no parasite strain of T. equiperdum has been isolated in any country of the world since 1982 {{and most of the}} strains currently available in national veterinary diagnostic laboratories are related to Trypanosoma evansi. One hypothesis asserts that T. equiperdum does not exist as a separate species and the disease condition “dourine ” is actually a host-specific immune response to either Trypanosoma brucei equiperdum or T. evansi infection. A more recent study of kinetoplast DNA proposes that T. equiperdum, along with Trypanosoma evansi, are subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei. Definitive categorisation of <b>Dourine</b> is pending. Resistance to physical and chemical action This agent does not survive very long outside its hosts and is not transmitted by fomites, therefore, parameters associated with resistance to physical and chemical actions (i. e. temperature, chemical/disinfectants, and environmental survival) are not meaningful. EPIDEMIOLOGY <b>Dourine</b> is the only trypanosomosis that is not transmitted by an invertebrate vector and also differs from other trypanosomes in that it is primarily a tissue parasite that rarely invades the blood. <b>Dourine</b> is transmitted during breeding or infected mares may occasionally pass infection to foals.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} from August 2005 to January 2007 to determine prevalence and distribution of <b>dourine</b> in horses and to investigate the occurrence of clinical and carrier cases in donkeys and mules in the Arsi-Bale highlands.

The questionnaire indicated that <b>dourine</b> is a major health problem of equines in the Arsi-Bale highlands. Though <b>dourine</b> is commonly observed throughout the year, it has a seasonal character and occurs mostly during the breeding season from June to late September. Serological screening of 646 horses showed a seroprevalence of 184 (28 %), 161 (25 %) and 125 (19 %) for card agglutination test for trypanosomosis, LATEX and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Risk factors were parity number, previous history of abortion and body condition score. No trypanosomes could be detected by Giemsa staining or by haematocrit centrifugation technique. Ten puppies inoculated with blood samples, genital washes and oedematous fluids remained parasitologically negative. Different characteristic signs of <b>dourine</b> were observed. During the genital stage, mares showed vaginal oedema, discharge and presence of depigmented scars over the external genitalia. In stallions, oedema of the scrotum and prepuce, prepucial and urethral discharge, and ulceration of the genital mucosae mainly of the penile were observed.

40|$|Background: Trypanosoma equiperdum causes <b>dourine</b> via sexual {{transmission}} in Equidae. T. equiperdum is classified under the subgenus Trypanozoon {{along with the}} T. brucei sspp. and T. evansi; however, the species classification of Trypanozoon remains a controversial topic due to {{the limited number of}} T. equiperdum reference strains. In addition, it is possible that some were misclassified T. evansi strains. Thus, there is a strong need for a new T. equiperdum strain directly isolated from the genital mucosa of a horse with a clinically-and parasitologically-confirmed <b>dourine</b> infection. Methods: Trypanosomes isolated from the urethral tract of a stallion with suspected <b>dourine,</b> were directly cultivated using soft agarose media at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO 2. For molecular characterization, 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 8 maxicircle DNA regions were amplified by a PCR and their sequences were determined. To analyze the ratio of the kinetoplastic/akinetoplastic population, the kinetoplasts and the nuclei of trypanosomes were subjected to Hoechst staining and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Results: In addition to the clinical symptoms and the molecular diagnosis, this stallion was definitively diagnosed with <b>dourine</b> by the detection of trypanosomes in the urethral mucosa. These results strongly suggested that the isolated trypanosome was true T. equiperdum. T. equiperdum isolated from the urethral tract was adapted in vitro using soft agarose media. Based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis of 18 S rRNA and ITS, this T. equiperdum isolate was classified into the Trypanozoon clade. In a PCR of the maxicircle DNA region, only NADH-dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 5 was amplified. Clear kinetoplasts were observed in most of the T. equiperdum isolates. In contrast, most culture-adapted T. equiperdum were of the akinetoplastic form. Conclusion: We concluded that our isolated trypanosome was the first confirmed case of T. equiperdum in Mongolia and named it "T. equiperdum IVM-t 1 ". T. equiperdum IVM-t 1 was well adapted and propagated in soft agarose media, which indicates that this culture method is useful for isolation of T. equiperdum from horses with <b>dourine...</b>|$|E
40|$|During its 20 th {{annual meeting}} in Paris in May 1999, the OIE (World {{organisation}} for animal health) Ad Hoc Group on Non-Tsetse Transmitted Animal Trypanosomoses expressed the following concerns about dourine: the discrepancies {{in some of the}} results of the complement fixation test (CFT), which is the only international diagnostic test officially recognised by the International Organisation for the Transportation of Equidae; the persistence of suspected cases of <b>dourine</b> in some Asian, European and African countries; the impossibility of differentiating Trypanosoma equiperdum from Trypanosoma evansi and of isolating new strains of T. equiperdum from clinical cases that have appeared in various parts of the world since 1982. In the light of these concerns, it was decided, in agreement with the Directorate of the Federal Veterinary Services of Russia in Moscow, to perform comparative trials on the value of CFT/dourine at the OIE Reference Laboratory for <b>dourine</b> in Moscow (The All-Russian Research Institute of Experimental Veterinary Medicine) using reagents (antigens and sera) from seven countries with extensive experience in the field of <b>dourine</b> diagnosis, namely, South Africa, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. It is thanks to the successful co-operation of these countries that the trials were made possible. Results showed an overall concordance and were submitted for consideration to the OIE Biological Standards Commission, the commission which is in charge of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. These trials serve as a starting point for further study, particularly in the following areas: the isolation of new strains of T. equiperdum from clinical <b>dourine</b> cases; the identification of specific markers for T. equiperdum which would make it possible to differentiate it from among the other species within the subgenus Trypanozoon; the experimental infection of horses with newly isolated T. equiperdum strains to compare their pathogenicity with those currently used in national diagnostic laboratories and with that of T. evansi; phylogenetic studies; the proposal and validation of new, internationally recognised diagnostic test(s) for <b>dourine.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

In addition, there are no reports on drug discovery, because no drug screening system exists for this parasite. A new T.  equiperdum strain was recently isolated from the genital organ of a stallion that showed typical symptoms of <b>dourine.</b> In the present study, we adapted T.  equiperdum IVM-t 1 from soft agarose media to HMI- 9 liquid media to develop a drug screening assay for T.  equiperdum. An intracellular ATP-based luciferase assay using CellTiter-Glo reagent and an intracellular dehydrogenase activity-based colorimetric assay using WTS- 8 tetrazolium salt (CCK- 8 reagent) were used {{in order to examine}} the trypanocidal effects of each compound. In addition, the IC 50 values of 4 reference trypanocidal compounds (pentamidine, diminazene, suramin and melarsomine) were evaluated and compared using established assays. The IC 50 values of these reference compounds corresponded well to previous studies involving other strains of T. equiperdum. The luciferase assay would be suitable for the mass screening of chemical libraries against T.  equiperdum because it allows for the simple and rapid-evaluation of the trypanocidal activities of test compounds, while a simple, inexpensive colorimetric assay will be applicable in developing countries for the evaluation of the drug sensitivity of epidemic trypanosome strains...|$|E

40|$|Diagnosis {{and control}} of <b>dourine</b> is {{strongly}} based on serological evidence, but knowledge of the humoral response of horses during infection is limited. In this study we developed a chemiluminescent immunoblotting (cIB) assay to characterise the Trypanosoma equiperdum antigen pattern recognised by IgGs from naturally or experimentally dourine-infected horses and analyse the kinetics of IgG humoral response following the infection. One compounding factor is that sera from uninfected animals often cross-react with T. equiperdum antigens. Development of the cIB assay {{was based on the}} hypothesis that serum IgGs from healthy and infected animals recognise different T. equiperdum antigen patterns. We used sera from 8 naturally infected horses which had recovered from Italian outbreaks and 2 experimentally infected mares. In addition, sera from 10 healthy control animals, eight of which were CFT positive but IFA negative for <b>dourine,</b> were collected from disease free regions. Sera were compared by the complement fixation test (CFT), indirect immune fluorescence (IFA) and the cIB assay. cIB analysis revealed that IgGs from infected horses, in contrast to IgGs from healhty horses, specifically recognise a T. equiperdum antigenic profile with low molecular weight bands ranging between 16 and 35 kDa. A time course experiment indicated that IgGs specific for the 16 - 35 kDa parasite protein fraction appear 17 days post-infection. The cIB assay confirmed all ten infected animals as positive and all controls as negative.

Diminasan((R)) at doses from 3. 5 mg/kg to 28 mg/kg and Cymelarsan((R)) at doses of 0. 25 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg body weight failed to cure any of the mice, indicating a clear dose dependent relationship in the mean time of relapse observed in mice. Indeed, mice treated with lower doses relapsed after a shorter time than mice treated with higher doses. However, mice treated with Cymelarsan((R)) at doses of 1. 0 mg/kg and 2. 0 mg/kg body weight were cured and no parasitemia was observed for 60 days. The efficacy of Cymelarsan((R)) was also tested in horses. Two groups of horses containing two animals each were infected with T. equiperdum 834 / 940 Dodola strain and treated with Cymelarsan((R)) at a dose rate of 0. 25 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg, respectively. Cymelarsan((R)) at 0. 25 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg body weight cleared parasitemia within 24 h post treatment {{and none of the}} animals were found to show relapse throughout the 320 days of observation. The sensitivity of the particular trypanosome strain to Cymelarsan((R)) was also supported by the relative improvement in the mean PCV levels of horses following treatment. A statistically significant difference (p< 0. 01) in the mean PCV levels of horses treated with Cymelarsan((R)) was observed between day 20 at peak parasitemia and days 40 as well as 60 of observation. The mean PCV levels of horses in the control group progressively decreased within the first 60 days of post infection. Two of the horses in the control group developed chronic form of <b>dourine</b> manifested by genital as well as nervous signs with progressive loss of body condition within 320 days post infection.

40|$|In nearly 50 per cent. of the cases, virulent {{trypanosome}} virus inoculated {{directly through}} the stomach wall of rats failed to infect these animals. The percentage of infections after inoculation {{of this kind}} seemed to vary with the virus. Surra of India {{proved to be the}} most virulent, and caderas the least. Nagana and <b>dourine</b> occupied intermediate positions. The rats that escaped infection showed no trace of immunity when tested with small quantities of the same virus between the twelfth and the twenty-eighth days after the intra-stomachal inoculations. The majority of the rats tested for immunity with surra of India and nagana seemed to have acquired, instead of an immunity, a certain hypersensitiveness to infection. Five of the seven nagana rats died before their controls. The results of testing the vitality of the trypanosomes of caderas, <b>dourine,</b> and nagana introduced directly into the stomachs and intestines of living rats seem to show that both motility and virulence are usually lost in less than two hours. Surra of India proved exceptionally resistant to the harmful influences of the stomach, for in one case, surra trypanosomes introduced into the intestines were found to be sluggishly motile in the stomach one hour and fifty-five minutes later, and in another instance, surra parasites injected into the stomach were found, when removed from that organ two hours later, to be actively motile and infectious...|$|E
40|$|These {{results show}} that the South African strain of <b>dourine</b> like the chronic form of the disease in other {{countries}} is not readily transmitted to laboratory animals. But where the invasive power of the strain has been boosted by serial blood passage in equines it is easily transmitted to rabbit testicles and to white rats provided the rats are splenectomised. The rabbit-adapted parasite remains localised and shows little tendency to enter the blood stream. In the splenectomised white rat, the parasites rapidly increase in virulence and are soon adapted to normal white rats. The strain has been passaged over 50 times in normal white rats. Guinea pigs and rabbits, are resistant. The strain differs in this respect from our imported one which is virulent for these animals. What part bartonellosis plays in rendering splenectomised rats susceptible to the disease is not known. Both the rabbit-testicle and rat-adapted parasites were indistinguishable morphologically from the original strain, and from our imported strain. An antigen prepared from the rat strain gave the same results as our routine antigen when tested against sera from normal and <b>dourine</b> infected horses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a seroepidemiological survey of trypanozoon infection in horses carried out between September 2007 and June 2008. The survey was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of anti-trypanozoon antibodies in 880 serum samples collected randomly from selected horse-breeding districts of the Bale highlands of Ethiopia. The seroprevalence of trypanozoon infection was found to be 173 (19. 66 %) and 140 (15. 91 %) for the CATT/T. evansi and LATEX/T. evansi tests, respectively. The high seroprevalence of trypanozoon infection strongly indicates that the infection is endemic. Neither test can differentiate between anti-trypanozoon antibodies caused by infection with T. equiperdum (the causative agent of <b>dourine)</b> and those of T. evansi (the causative agent of surra). The findings of the present study suggest that field-applicable screening serological tests such as the CATT/T. evansi and LATEX/T. evansi could be useful for epidemiological studies and the control of trypanozoon infection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|African trypanosomiases, {{including}} the human disease {{referred to as}} 'sleeping sickness' and the animal diseases such as nagana, surra and <b>dourine,</b> are neglected vector-borne diseases that after years of research still need improved diagnosis and chemotherapy. Advances in proteomics offer new tools to define biomarkers, whose expression may reflect host-parasite interactions occurring during the infection. In this review, the authors first describe the current diagnostic tools used to detect a trypanosome infection during field surveys, and then discuss their interests, limits and further evolutions. The authors also report on the contribution of molecular diagnostics, and the recent advances and developments that make it suitable for fieldwork. The authors then explore the recent uses of proteomics technology to define host and parasite biomarkers that allow detection of the infection, the power and constraints of the technology. The authors conclude by discussing the urgent {{need to use the}} biomarkers discovered in order to develop tools to improve trypanosomiasis control in the near future. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosomes cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in man and domestic animals in Africa, Latin America and Asia. In the Trypanozoon subgenus, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense cause human African trypanosomiasis, while T. b. brucei, T. evansi and T. equiperdum are responsible for nagana, surra and <b>dourine</b> in domestic animals, respectively. The genetic relationships between T. evansi and T. equiperdum and other Trypanozoon species remain unclear {{because the majority of}} phylogenetic analyses have been based on only a few genes. In this study, we have conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on genome-wide SNP analysis comprising 56 genomes from the Trypanozoon subgenus. Our data reveal that T. equiperdum has emerged at least once in Eastern Africa and T. evansi at two independent occasions in Western Africa. The genomes within the T. equiperdum and T. evansi monophyletic clusters show extremely little variation, probably due to the clonal spread linked to the independence from tsetse flies for their transmission.

40|$|The {{complement}} fixation test (CFT), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared in their application to the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma equiperdum infection in 43 horses. The CFT remains a reliable test for <b>dourine,</b> especially in countries where {{other members of the}} subgenus Trypanozoon do not occur. The IFAT is a Good 'back-up' test, but, requiring skilled operators it has the disadvantage of making it labour intensive, and interpretation of results subjective. This makes it more suited to small numbers of samples. The ELISA is suitable for large numbers of samples and could readily be used in routine diagnostic procedures. The CATT could be of value in field situations, although it {{does not appear to be}} as sensitive as the CFT. Its possible application under these conditions should be further investigated.
