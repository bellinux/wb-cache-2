5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.|$|E

5|$|Spores are {{elliptical}} or oblong in shape, smooth, inamyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of 3.5–4.5 by 1.5–2.5 µm. The use of {{scanning electron microscopy}} <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> L.periphragmoides (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar—a small indentation in {{the surface of the}} spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma.|$|E
5|$|Telopea oreades {{is one of}} five {{species from}} southeastern Australia that make up the genus Telopea. No {{subspecies}} are recognised. It has been difficult to distinguish from the similar T.mongaensis, but microscopic analysis <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> T.oreades has features termed sclereids while T.mongaensis does not. The two are sister species, and their next closest relative is the Tasmanian waratah (T. truncata).|$|E
5|$|The monastery, {{which is}} next to the River Washford, would have been {{surrounded}} by gardens, fishponds, orchards, barns, guesthouses, stables, a farmyard and industrial buildings. The abbey grounds were defended by a water filled moat and a gatehouse. Excavation <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> a large stone cross, like a market cross, stood {{just west of the}} main building.|$|E

Scanning electron microscopy <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> C.ruber (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar—a small indentation {{in the surface}} of the spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are six-spored.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> many unpublicized structural {{problems at the}} mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, {{the ground}} of Queen Maud Land is {{dominated}} by Precambrian gneiss, formed c.1 to 1.2Ga, before {{the creation of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks, formed c.500 to 600Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In the farthest western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> without the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> {{for the most part}} the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> {{it is more likely}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Inspection under {{infrared}} <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> {{the panels}} were heavily reworked during {{a number of}} revisions. The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen did not record {{any of his}} works. However, three younger {{contemporary}} conductors who {{had worked}} with him, Thomas Jensen, Launy Grøndahl, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first LP recording of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete Carl Nielsen Edition <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} note is that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> {{the very same}} workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
30|$|Literatures {{pertaining}} to drainage morphometry <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> parameters such as total stream length and watershed area {{are very much}} useful for understanding the mean annual runoff character in a drainage watershed. The analysis of total stream length data and watershed area data <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> for watersheds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 36.|$|R

5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was first}} {{occupied}} {{at the end}} of the Early Preclassic period. The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. These first houses were built with floors made from river cobbles and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles. Pollen analysis <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate maize and other plants. Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Fold Way is also {{reflected}} in the group's initiatory system, which has seven grades through which the member can gradually progress. Theses are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal. The group <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees, and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with a slab {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) wide, with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> <b>that</b> flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.|$|E
