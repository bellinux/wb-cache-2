However, the description of <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> has not drawn a widely consensus all the time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the demand and price characteristics for lamb in the US and Oregon. The primary objective was to estimate coefficients for three variables in a demand function for lamb, and these variables were the production of lamb, the production of substitute meats, and an income factor. Two secondary objectives were to determine the influence of imported mutton on the price of lamb, and to consider the future trend in the price of lamb. The analysis consisted of two parts, the development of a single equation demand function for lamb and the formation of a structural model of the sheep industry. In both cases the price of lamb was taken as a dependent variable, and price flexibility coefficients were estimated for the other variables. The <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the production of lamb was estimated to be 0. 88 in the single equation and - 1. 22 in the structural model. The structural flexibility was considered to be the best estimate as the validity of this coefficient did not depend on the assumption that the quantity of lamb produced was determined independently of the price. There were indications that the current price of lamb did influence the quantity produced. The conclusion reached was that the price was slightly flexible to changes in lamb production. The <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the production of substitute meats was - 1. 11 in the single equation and - 1. 18 in the structural model. The high <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> indicates that the level of production of substitute meats is important in determining the price of lamb. The <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the income variable was + 0. 20 in the single equation and + 0. 42 in the structural model. Both estimates show a positive inflexible relationship with the price. To evaluate the impact of imports on the price of lamb it was found necessary to estimate the annual production of mutton in the US, as no data give this information directly. A variable for the total quantity of mutton was included in the single equation demand function. The price decline associated with the increase of imports was estimated to be small. Although the total quantity of mutton increased by 39 percent between 1958 and 1959, over 93 percent of the decline in price was attributed to other variables. The <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the production of lamb in Oregon was estimated to be - 0. 54. This indicates a greater inflexibility of the lamb price than was found for the US. A higher flexibility of the price was associated with the production of lamb in California. This indicated that California provides an important outlet for the marketing of lamb from Oregon. The production of substitute meats and the income variable have expanded consistently throughout the period of the analysis. The net effect of these two variables was estimated from the structural model to cause a decrease in the price of lamb of 0. 67 /cwt each year. However, the model indicates that producers tend to reduce the size of the breeding flock in response to a decline in price. This reduction and the decrease in the size of the lamb crop that would follow are expected to partially offset the price decline. The conclusion reached is that lamb prices can only be maintained at the present level if the size of the breeding flock decreases...|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of surface waves (SASW) method is an in-situ seismic method used {{for determining the}} thickness and elastic properties of soil and pavement. The SASW method is fast and economical to perform since no boreholes are required. The method is suitable for sites where the use of large equipment is difficult or where sublayer conditions {{make it difficult to}} perform other seismic tests. The SASW method is also ideal for preliminary field investigations to be conducted prior to more detailed site investigation, and for quality control and monitoring of ground improvement. The purpose of this research was to improve the SASW method by incorporating multi-mode propagation in the backcalculation procedure. In order to facilitate the investigation carried out in this study, two computer programs were developed to simulate SASW tests (and also Steady-State surface wave tests) and to calculate theoretical dispersion curves. The program for calculating theoretical dispersion curves was based on the root-searching procedure used in existing backcalculation methods. The computer programs developed in this study were used in a case study to demonstrate difficulties encountered by existing methods in dealing with multi-mode situations. It was shown that: (i) wavelength filtering criteria used by existing methods yield inconsistent (i. e. erroneous) dispersion curves when more than one propagation mode participate in the wave field, and (ii) backcalculation procedures based on root-searching cannot identify predominant propagation modes and hence fail to yield accurate results in the case of multi-mode propagation. Two developments were made in the present study to overcome the above difficulties. First, a new wavelength filtering criterion was adopted. In this criterion, the dispersion data point for a particular frequency is rejected (i. e. filtered out) if the values of phase velocity obtained from two different receiver-to-receiver spacings are not in close agreement. In this manner, inconsistencies that might result in the dispersion due to multi-mode propagation are avoided. Second, a new procedure to calculate the theoretical dispersion curve was developed. This procedure is based on the maximum vertical <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> (at each frequency) of the theoretical layered model. Unlike root-searching methods, the maximum vertical <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> method easily identifies predominant propagation modes. A computer program was developed in this study for backcalculation of SASW data based on the <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> method. Least-squares optimization using the down-hill simplex method was also implemented in this program to automate the backcalculation process. The accuracy of the above proposed procedures was demonstrated using SASW field tests. The shear wave velocity profiles obtained using the procedures developed in this study are in good agreement with those obtained from other in-situ seismic tests. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Integration limits in expressions of Equation 8 are from 0 to α for depth of crack and the limits for width are not specified (Figure 1 b). The limits of integration on width depend on the open part of the crack, which can be obtained from the sign of SIF along the crack edge. The negative sign of SIF indicates compressive stress and the closed crack condition and positive sign indicates tensile state of stress and open crack condition. Accordingly, depending on the instantaneous state of forces acting on the crack element, the SIF is influenced, which influences the stiffness coefficients.

The presence of cracks causes changes in the physical properties of a structure and its dynamic response characteristics. The monitoring of the changes in the response parameters of a structure has been widely used for the assessment of structural integrity, performance and safety.

Dispersion curves were drawn for all the sites. The maximum wavelength (lambda(max)), the maximum depth (d(max)) up to which exploration can be made and the frequency content of the signals depends on the site stiffness and the value of S. A stiffer site yields greater values of lambda(max) and d(max). For stiffer sites, an increase in S leads to an increase in lambda(max). The predominant time durations of the signals increase from stiffer to softer sites.

40|$|The {{harmonic}} vibration of {{a machine}} is an undesirable effect of rotating out-of balance mass within the system. It may influence the machine operation by create unwanted noise and resulting excess wear. However the vibration of the machine can be suppressed by attaching vibration absorber whose natural frequency is tuned to be equivalent to the excitation frequency of the machine. Almost vibration absorber is only effective at particular forcing frequency. A way of overcoming this problem is by designing an adaptive tuned vibration absorber which could adapt itself in response to changes in excitation frequency of machine.

The fine contents are much higher, and relatively comparable to Eucalyptus tereticornis in terms of curl index and kinks per mm...|$|R
40|$|Plum (Prunus domestica) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} species of fruit trees in Asia and South-East Europe. There are large quantities of fruit wood trees without suitable usage in world. The aim of this research was to examine biometrical and chemical properties of the plum wood and its application in the pulp and paper industry. Five normal plum trees were randomly selected from Shahriyar province, Iran. A log cut down at stem (breast height) and branch for each of trees. The pith parts of cross-section were removed to examine the chemical (according to the TAPPI standard) and biometrical properties (according to the Franklin method). Results indicated that there were significant differences between stem and branch samples in fiber diameter and lumen diameter. Types of wood (branch and stem) had not significant differences on the chemical properties and fiber length, cell wall thickness and morphological properties. Among all of studied properties, the lignin, cellulose, fiber diameter, fiber lumen diameter, cell wall thickness and <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> in branch wood is higher than stem wood. Although Runkel and flexibility coefficients of stem and branch fibers are lower than the accepted standard, but because of closing amount of lignin, extractive composition and fiber length to hardwood species, it can solve some of the problems of the lack of raw materials for paper production...|$|E
40|$|Sudan is {{endowed with}} a great {{diversity}} of tree species, nevertheless the use of wood resources has traditionally concentrated on a few number of them, Despite the richness of Sudan in most basic factors required to establish forest-based industries, it still almost entirely depends on imports to satisfy its needs of the products of such industries like pulp, paper, fiberboard,…etc. The present study was carried out to investigate some wood properties of Balanites aegyptiaca and to assess its suitability for pulp, paper and flooring industries. The wood materials were collected from the Blue Nile, North Kordofan, South Kordofan and White Nile states. Some anatomical, physical and mechanical properties were investigated, and their results {{were used to determine}} the suitability of the selected tree species for pulp, paper and flooring industries. Fiber length, diameter, lumen diameter and double wall thickness were measured and the data were used to obtain the Runkel ratio, slenderness ratio and coefficient of suppleness (or <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient).</b> Wood density and hardness strength were determined. The results revealed that the wood anatomical, mechanical and physical properties of the study species may qualify it for pulp, paper and flooring industries. The results may encourage the establishment of such forest-based industry in Sudan. This would not only reduce imports, but it would also provide an economic incentive to the forestry and industrial sectors of Sudan...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the fiber dimensions, physical and chemical properties of the bast and without bast stalk of Sahel-Variety of cotton stalk, required samples were prepared and studied. The results showed that fiber and lumen diameter and  cell wall thickness of  without bast stalk fibers were greater than those of bast fibers, while bast fibers were longer. Thus, this fibers can be classified as short and medium length fibers respectively. Data showed that the Length/ Diameter ratio and Runkle ratio of the bast fibers were greater than those of without bast stalk fibers, and <b>flexibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> in without bast stalk fibers was greater. Stalk with higher diameter had less bast proportion. Oven-dried density and swelling and shrinkage values of thicker stalks were greater than those of thinner ones, but apparent and basic densities,as well as porosity in thinner stalks were higher. Chemical Properties of bast and without bast stalk were respectively as follow: cellulose 39. 27 % and 48. 3 %,lignin 23. 93 % and 21. 89 %,extractives 6. 06 % and 3. 23 %, ash content 6. 36 % and 1. 85 %,one percent sodium hydroxide solubility 48. 35 % and 21. 275 % and hot water solubility 19. 48 % and 9. 68 %. These indicate that without bast stalk fibers are more suitable than bast fibers for pulp production, but bast fibers are preferred in terms of fiber length...|$|E

The originality of the present contribution lies in the construction {{and the study of}} generalized shrinkage operators, whose goal is to identify structured significance maps. These generalize Group LASSO and the previously introduced Elitist LASSO by introducing more <b>flexibility</b> in the <b>coefficient</b> domain modeling. We study experimentally the performances of corresponding shrinkage operators in terms of significance map estimation in the orthogonal basis case. We also study their performance in the overcomplete situation, using iterative thresholding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{lot of good}} {{properties}} of étale cohomology only hold for torsion coefficients. We use ultraproducts respectively enlargement construction to define a cohomology theory that inherits the important {{properties of}} étale cohomology while allowing greater <b>flexibility</b> with the <b>coefficients.</b> In particular, choosing coefficients ∗Z/P∗Z (for P an infinite prime and ∗Z the enlargement of Z) gives a Weil cohomology, and choosing ∗Z/lh∗Z (for l a finite prime and h an infinite number) allows comparison with ordinary l-adic cohomology. More generally, for every N∈∗Z, we get a category of ∗Z/N∗Z-constructible sheaves with good properties...|$|R
40|$|For {{straight}} or {{spiral bevel}} gears of nominal spherical involute design, the resultant total force vector transmitted by the gear mesh, {{in the absence of}} friction, lies in the plane of tooth contact. This force vector can be characterized by three scalar components, two orthogonal force components lying in the plane of contact and the resultant moment taken about the nominal center of the zone of contact. Equations for these three generalized force components are derived. The equations are expressed in terms of tooth pair/gear body stiffnesses, bearing/bearing support <b>flexibility</b> influence <b>coefficients,</b> the shaft input torque, deviations of the tooth running surfaces from perfect spherical involute surfaces, and bearing centerline offsets from the positions occupied by the base cone axes of the perfect involute bevel gear counterparts to the actual gears under consideration. Inertial forces arising from transverse and axial vibrations of the gear bodies are assumed to be negligible in comparison with the bearing support reaction forces...|$|R
