25|$|The Mitre 10 Cup {{competition}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} times. There {{have been up}} to three Divisions, with promotion/relegation between the two bottom divisions. Since 2006 there have been semi-finals and a final in each Division. Winners receive four competition points; if the game was a draw two points are awarded to each team. The Rugby union bonus points system is also used, where any team scoring four or more tries or losing by less than seven points receives an extra competition point. The top four teams {{at the end of}} the round-robin phase then played semifinals – the first placed team hosting the fourth team, and the second team hosting the third team. The two winners played the final at the home ground of the top surviving seed.|$|E
25|$|The {{immigrant}} population in Bergen <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 {{people with a}} non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western {{immigrant population}} in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also {{in relation to the}} total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of Poles in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.|$|E

25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> number of {{times over the years}} but the airport was wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council until 2004 when it was sold to a {{consortium}} led by Wolverhampton Airport operators City Hopper Ltd (CHAL), who operated it until May 2008 when Balfour Beatty purchased MAR Property's 95% stake; Blackpool Borough Council having retained 5%. The remaining 5% is held by Blackpool Borough Council. During 2014 Balfour Beatty claimed to be looking for a buyer for the airport and then after just one month announced that it was to close the Airport. On 15 October 2014, the airport's terminal and Air Traffic Control provision was closed with the last scheduled flights to Dublin & Isle of Man leaving in the late afternoon. In November 2014, the former company formed a new company called Squires Gate Airport Operations Ltd and the airport reopened once again in December 2014 for non-commercial operations.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Honda CR-Z {{received}} a minor refresh. It {{received a}} {{change to the}} front and rear bumper, as well as a slightly revised interior. It also gained the EX-L trim from the refresh with a small increase in price. The base price LX trim starts at $20,295 with a manual transmission, and $20,945 with a continuously variable transmission or CVT. The EX trim increased to $22,140 with a manual transmission, and $22,790 with a CVT. The new EX-L trim starts at $24,440 with a manual transmission, and $25,090 with a CVT. The refresh <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> few colors as well. The North Shore Blue Pearl color changed to the Aegean Blue Metallic color, the Crystal Black Pearl color has changed to the Jet Black color, and Premium White Pearl has changed to Ivory Pearl. On the EX trim, the secondary interior red color has changed to orange. The CR-Z also gained a few new wheel designs for the refresh. Honda had previously confirmed that a second generation of the CR-Z was under development, possibly for the 2018 model year.|$|E
25|$|For some time, {{especially}} {{through the}} work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting {{as a method of}} shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, {{such as the use of}} sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> <b>A</b> past may still be suggested for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{shooting}} lasted {{nearly twenty}} consecutive hours, {{and it was}} exhausting for Kalomira and for the team that worked {{under the guidance of}} director Kostas Kapetanidis. The director decided to focus {{on the face of the}} young performer and so chose to do the shoot in a studio and not outdoors. Sometimes alone, sometimes flanked by dancers, Kalomira danced and sang while wearing clothes selected from the collection of J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez. In some scenes of the video, impressive objects with bright colors such as a red Ducati motor bike, a huge disco ball, and big letters with the title of the song were used. The choreography was by Svitailof Ivan and the styling was George Segredaki and Constantine Koutsomichou while the hair and make-up were overseen by Dimitris Giannetos. Through the video clip, Kalomira reveals another side of: sexy, feminine, charming but always innocent and sweet in a quick clip of the montage. In the video edition, the song <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> lot. On March 14, 2008, NET exclusively aired the official Eurovision video clip of Secret combination during their evening news at 20:00 CET. International fans were able to watch through a satellite broadcast on ERT World. Critical reaction to the song was mostly positive.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> great deal from when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] {{be involved in the}} music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.

500|$|Homer's {{behavior}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} times through {{the run of the}} series. He was originally [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further explored. In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious about how he was perceived by others. In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as executive producer (seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001), he became more of [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf". Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset [...] now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck." [...] Fans have dubbed this incarnation of the character [...] "Jerkass Homer". At voice recording sessions, Dan Castellaneta has rejected material written in the script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is [...] "boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose." [...] When editing The Simpsons Movie, several scenes were changed or otherwise toned down to make Homer more sympathetic.|$|E

[...] Jon Bershad of Mediaite commented, [...] "It’s as tense and exciting as expected." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author [...] "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist". Joe Flint of Los Angeles Times commented about changes in the media industry since Carter's prior book The Late Shift, [...] "The only difference is that the media world <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> lot then, and while [...] "The Late Shift" [...] had a lot of inside dirt and drama that was news to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote, [...] "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: the guy with the best contract, wins", and called the book, [...] "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher". Writing for ABC News, journalist Sheila Marikar commented, [...] "Bill Carter's new book, 'The War for Late Night,' reveals what happened behind the scenes, the expletives that were hurled during closed-door discussions, the roller coaster that O'Brien, Leno, and their cohorts rode during that tumultuous time." ...|$|E
