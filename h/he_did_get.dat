Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions.

According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E

In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest.

5|$|The local batsmen {{were unable}} to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his {{opponent}} had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.N- However, he was often effective when <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> an opportunity.|$|E

25|$|His {{statistics}} on his international debut tour to New Zealand {{were not very}} impressive, as he got two wickets {{at the cost of}} 48 runs apiece, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> five wickets quite cheaply on Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa. Nevertheless, Morkel was picked for the Africa squad to play Asia in the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup, but withdrew due to injury. He appeared however for Africa the following series, in 2007, and made history in the second game when he opened the bowling with his brother Morné, the first time two brothers have done so in ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|Hodge {{was dropped}} after only five {{tests in the}} team, and only three tests after scoring his double century against South Africa. The {{selectors}} stated that {{the decision was made}} {{on the back of a}} poor Pura Cup season by Hodge, averaging around 25 for the summer when the team was selected (he finished the season with an average of 33.3). The decision was unpopular amongst Victorian fans, particularly since his replacement, Damien Martyn, had averaged only 23.7 in the same Pura Cup season. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> back, however, albeit more than two years later, when included in Australia's squad that toured the West Indies in May/June 2008.

25|$|With every Essex batsman except number 11 Steyn (run out for 0) scoring {{in double}} figures, Essex showed a real team effort, with in-form opener William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 as Essex {{got into a}} {{relatively}} comfortable lead of 142. Leicestershire fought back well on the third day, though, having lost Maddy before stumps {{on the second day}} to be 57 for 1. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman all passed 30, and Claude Henderson chipped in with a fine 55 from number 9, as Leicestershire made their way to a lead of 190. Only Gough showed consistent threat, taking four wickets for 60, while Steyn again became too inconsistent - he conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> the wickets of Robinson and Ottis Gibson.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} summer, {{he finally}} made his first-class debut against Somerset, albeit for Cambridge University rather than Worcestershire. He failed twice with the bat and bowled only four overs, and three further {{games for the}} university brought little change in his fortunes. Nevertheless, Worcestershire selected him to make his first-team debut on 23 June in the local derby against Warwickshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup. Despite his county's 12-run victory, it was a personal anticlimax: Boyns neither batted nor bowled. Three days later <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> to bat against Gloucestershire in the Gillette Cup, but was lbw to Procter for a duck. One day later still, he turned out against Surrey in the John Player League, but once more {{did not get a}} turn at the crease.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Somerset Second XI in 1999 and his List A debut for Somerset Cricket Board in the 2000 NatWest Trophy. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Somerset against West Indies 'A' in 2002 {{and made his}} Championship debut in 2003. He made more appearances in 2005 and was particularly valuable in one day games. In 2006 he became a regular member of the team. His maiden first-class century was 146* against Derbyshire at Derby in 2005. His best bowling in first-class cricket is 3-23 against Sri Lanka 'A' in 2004. Although he did not score a century in 2006 <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> seven Championship scores over 50 and was the leading fielder with 15 catches. He was released by Somerset in November 2009 when his contract expired.|$|E

Leicestershire surpassed their first innings score with five wickets in hand the second time around, though, before Gough and Napier dug out two wickets to have them 228 for 7. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman had all passed 30, and Claude Henderson paired up with Ackerman to add 96 for the eighth wicket – the second-highest partnership of the match, as Leicestershire {{made their way to}} a lead of 190. Gough was the only bowler to take more than two wickets, ending with four for 60, while Steyn conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> the wickets of Robinson and Gibson.|$|E

25|$|A low-scoring {{first day}} of cricket at Lord's {{included}} two batting collapses, first from Australia and then from England who got their go at batting just before tea. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and after Steve Harmison had shaken up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers, in particular one that had Justin Langer on the elbow, a procession of wickets began. Matthew Hoggard was inaccurate, but the early swing under the cloud suited him, and the ball that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> on line swung between bat and pad to smash into Matthew Hayden's off stump. Australia still scored quickly, helped by aggressive field placings from England, but Harmison got the reward for short and pacy bowling when Ricky Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer, who had looked immaculate all morning and taken on the bowlers, was next to depart, Michael Vaughan getting reward with his bowling changes as Andrew Flintoff lured Langer into an expansive pull to Harmison at square leg. And when Simon Jones was brought on in the 16th over, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn gone for 2. Another man came and went before lunch, Michael Clarke, and Australia were five down after the first session of play.|$|E

500|$|In early 1849, {{according}} to a letter written by Longacre the following year, the chief engraver was approached {{by a member of}} the Mint staff, warning him that another officer (plainly Peale) sought to have the engraving work done outside of the Mint, making Longacre redundant. [...] The outside engraver in question was Frenchman Louis Bouvet, whom Patterson had prepare a design for the half eagle, though it was not adopted. [...] Longacre's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar, at some cost to his health, as he later related.

500|$|Bangladesh lost wickets {{at regular}} {{intervals}} {{at the start of}} their innings; {{by the end of the}} 38th over, they had lost five wickets. Rahim joined Siddique after the fifth wicket fell, and the pair batted patiently together to see their side through to force the match into its final day. The partnership continued to battle during the fifth morning of the match, and Siddique reached his first Test century, coming from 262 deliveries. Shortly after, Prior failed to take a difficult catch, but Siddique did not capitalise on the mistake, adding no more runs before he was caught in the slips shortly after lunch. The bowler, Swann, swore at Siddique as he walked off the pitch, something he later apologised for, saying that it was [...] "a testament to him that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> everyone frustrated." [...] Rahim was bowled by Swann four overs later, and despite a late assault by Naeem Islam, who scored three fours and three sixes before being becoming Swann's 10th victim of the match, England won by 181 runs. Swann, who took five wickets in each innings, was the first English off spinner since Jim Laker in 1956 to take 10 wickets in a match. His performance in the match led to him rising to second place in the ICC Test bowling rankings.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E
