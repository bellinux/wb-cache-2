5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Quyllur Rit'i also attracts {{visitors}} {{from outside the}} Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} middle-class mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims. There has also been a rapid <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that it is becoming too commercialized. The pilgrimage and associated festival were inscribed in 2011 on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E
5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E

The current article reports on a recent study into direct selling that accounts for around 500, 000 "independent contractors" at any one time, albeit, in this case, operating often as part of an invisible economy, though linked with household-name direct selling companies. With the advent of more large companies, such as the recently privatised utilities, using direct selling as a distribution format, there is a strong case for achieving a wider understanding of the dynamics of this system. ...|$|R
5|$|From 1000 onwards, {{references}} to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians have interpreted this {{as evidence of}} a sudden {{increase in the number}} of castles in Europe around this time; this has been supported by archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950 Provence was home to 12castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, {{led by the}} Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{in which}} the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the {{university}} began {{to be separated from}} the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.|$|E
5|$|There were {{advances}} in manufacturing, {{especially in the}} South and West. Despite some French attacks, the war created much coastal prosperity thanks to the huge expenditure on shipbuilding during the war, and the South-West also became a centre for English piracy against foreign vessels. Metalworking continued to grow, and in particular pewter working, which generated exports second only to cloth. By the 15th century pewter working in London was a large industry, with a hundred pewter workers recorded in London alone, and pewter working had also spread from the capital to eleven major cities across England. London goldsmithing remained significant but saw relatively little growth, with around 150 goldsmiths working in London during the period. Iron-working continued to expand and in 1509 the first cast-iron cannon was made in England. This {{was reflected in the}} rapid <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> iron-working guilds, from three in 1300 to fourteen by 1422.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the largest}} {{political}} {{divisions of the}} Song known as circuits (lu) {{there were a number}} of prefectures (zhou), which in turn were divided into the smallest political units of counties (xian); there were about 1,230 counties during the Song period. The prefect during the early Northern Song was the prime official of local government authority, who was the lowest regional official allowed to memorialize the throne, was primary tax collector, and head magistrate over several magistrates within his jurisdiction that dealt with civil disputes and maintaining order. By the late Northern Song, the <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> counties with different proportions in population under a prefect's jurisdiction decreased the importance of the latter office, as it became more difficult for the prefect to manage the counties. This was part of a larger continuum of administrative trends from the Tang to Ming dynasties, with the gradual decline of importance of intermediate administrative units—the prefectures—alongside a shift of power from central government to large regional administrations; the latter experienced progressively less influence of central government in their routine affairs. In the Southern Song, four semi-autonomous regional command systems were established based on territorial and military units; this influenced the model of detached service secretariats which became the provincial administrations (sheng) of the Yuan (1279–1368), Ming (1368–1644), and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties. The administrative control of the Southern Song central government over the empire became increasingly limited to the circuits located in closer proximity to the capital at Hangzhou, while those farther away practiced greater autonomy.|$|E

Religious television is widely used by evangelical groups, but other religions using television broadcasting is also growing, such as Jewish groups broadcasting on the Odyssey. The audience for religious television is still mainly white, middle-class, evangelicals but, that is also changing as there {{is an increase in}} young Catholic viewers and Spanish-language religious television.
