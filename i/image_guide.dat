5000|$|Flexible borescopes {{suffer from}} pixelation and pixel {{crosstalk}} {{due to the}} fiber <b>image</b> <b>guide.</b> Image quality varies widely among different models of flexible borescopes depending {{on the number of}} fibers and construction used in the fiber <b>image</b> <b>guide.</b> Some high end borescopes offer a [...] "visual grid" [...] on image captures to assist in evaluating the size of any area with a problem. For flexible borescopes, articulation mechanism components, range of articulation, field of view and angles of view of the objective lens are also important. Fiber content in the flexible relay is also critical to provide the highest possible resolution to the viewer. Minimal quantity is 10,000 pixels while the best images are obtained with higher numbers of fibers in the 15,000 to 22,000 range for the larger diameter borescopes. The ability to control {{the light at the end}} of the insertion tube allows the borescope user to make adjustments that can greatly improve the clarity of video or still images.|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: Biopsy of palpable breast masses can be {{performed}} manually by palpation guidance or under imaging guidance. Based on retrospective studies, <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy is considered more accurate than palpation guided breast biopsy; however, these techniques have not been compared prospectively. We conducted this prospective study to verify the superiority and determine the size of beneficial effect of <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy over palpation guided biopsy. Methods: Over a period of 18 months, 36 patients each with palpable breast masses were randomized into palpation <b>guided</b> and <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> breast biopsy arms. Ultrasound was used for image guidance in 33 patients and mammographic (stereotactic) guidance in three patients. All biopsies were performed using 14 gauge automated core biopsy needles. Inconclusive, suspicious or imaging-histologic discordant biopsies were repeated. Results: Malignancy was found in 30 of 36 women in palpation guided biopsy arm and 27 of 36 women in <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy arm. Palpation guided biopsy had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 46. 7, 100, 100, 27. 3 per cent, respectively, for diagnosing breast cancer. Nineteen of 36 women (52. 8 %) required repeat biopsy because of inadequate samples (7 of 19), suspicious findings (2 of 19) or imaging-histologic discordance (10 of 19). On repeat biopsy, malignancy was found in all cases of imaging-histologic discordance. <b>Image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy had 96. 3 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity. There was no case of inadequate sample or imaging-histologic discordance with <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that in palpable breast masses, <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy was superior to palpation guided biopsy in terms of sensitivity, false negative rate and repeat biopsy rates...|$|R

50|$|Imageline, also {{image line}} or <b>image</b> <b>guide,</b> is a planar form of {{dielectric}} slab waveguide. It {{consists of a}} strip of dielectric, often alumina, on a metal sheet. In this format, there is no dielectric substrate extending in all horizontal directions, only the dielectric line.

It shows promise for use at the higher microwave frequencies, around 100 GHz, {{but it is still}} largely experimental. For instance Q factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive severely detract from this figure.

The cytologic results were divided into four categories (inconclusive, benign, suspicious and malignant. Pathologic results were also divided into two categories (benign, malignant) and additional statistical analysis was conducted to find te cut-off point between benign and malignant cytologic results. Following cytologic results were obtained: 7. 98 percent inconclusive, 67. 83 percent benign, 10. 97 percent suspicious, 13. 22 percent malignant.

40|$|International audienceA {{wide variety}} of three {{dimensional}} (3 D) measurement systems that can extract shape information's with sub millimetric accuracy {{is available in the}} industry. However, they generally are of macroscopic size and measuring on confined areas is not feasible. To miniaturize such systems, the step proposed is the integration of flexible image guides combined with compact optical probes. This miniaturization process is tested on an active stereoscopic measurement system. In the projection channel of the system, a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) generates structured binary patterns from an incoherent white light source and injects them into a first <b>image</b> <b>guide.</b> Then, a compact optical system projects the pattern on the measurement area. The same configuration principle is applied to the acquisition channel and allows the capture of the measurement area through a second <b>image</b> <b>guide</b> and finally to a digital camera. In this miniaturized system, image guides have lower resolution than in standard imaging devices. Indeed they are equivalent of 70 k pixels devices to compare to the almost 800 k pixels of the DMD and camera. That implies lower axial and lateral resolutions and consequently the shape reconstruction method must be carefully chosen. In this paper, several reconstruction strategies such as tuning the projected patterns frequency and also phase-shfit versus gray code based methods were compared considering the best axial resolution criteria. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
