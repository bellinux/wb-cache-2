Richard McDonald and George Dexter, the sign contractor who fabricated the first arches, recalled that Dexter {{came up with}} the idea and added them to the plans. Charles Fish, who did the working drawings and aided Meston in the design, attributes the idea to his familiarity with the form from a school project in which he used structural parabolas for a hangar.

50|$|The 2000 Baku {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} November 25 at 22:10 (18:10 GMT) local time, measuring 7.0 on the Richter {{scale in the}} epicentre and three minutes later followed by a quake measuring 5.9.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the epicentre was in the Caspian Sea, 25 km to the south-southeast of Baku. The earthquake was felt as far away as e.g. Tbilisi, 600 km northwest of the epicentre, Makhachkala and the Karabudakh and Isberbas settlements in Dagestan. It is assumed that the earthquake was triggered by active tectonic motion on the border of two major sections of the earth crust - the Turansk plate and the Kopedag-Caucasian <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> motion area.

50|$|Poured {{entirely in}} concrete, the Miami Marine Stadium {{consists}} of a dramatically cantilevered <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> roof supported by eight big slanted columns anchored in the ground through the grandstand. A huge horizontal beam tied them all together. A cut in the seating arrangement allowed spectators to appreciate the full height of the posts, which were pushed {{as far back as}} possible to permit unobstructed views over the watercourse. This concept was presented by one of the project's architects, Hilaro Candela to be original, however the idea was synonymous to several other well-established stadiums throughout Latin America and Europe, including the Florence Stadium designed by Pier Luigi Nervi, built 1932, the Baseball and Soccer stadiums in Cartagena, Colombia, by Guillermo Gonzalez Zuleta in 1947 and The University Stadium in Caracas designed by Carlos Raul Villanueva, built in 1950. The Miami Marine Stadium bears striking resemblance to the more elegant horse-racing Hipódromo de la Zarzuela in Madrid, Spain, designed by Carlos Arniches Moltó and Martín Domínguez in 1934-1935.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1980s, the {{capacitors}} in DRAM cells were co-planar with the access transistor (they were constructed {{on the surface}} of the substrate), thus they were referred to as planar capacitors. The drive to increase both density, and to a lesser extent, performance, required denser designs. This was strongly motivated by economics; a major consideration for DRAM devices, especially commodity DRAMs. The minimization of DRAM cell area can produce a denser device (which could be sold at a higher price), or a lower priced device with the same capacity. Starting in the mid-1980s, the capacitor has been moved above or below the silicon substrate in order to meet these objectives. DRAM cells featuring capacitors above the substrate are referred to as stacked or <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> capacitors; whereas those with capacitors buried beneath the substrate surface are referred to as trench capacitors. In the 2000s, manufacturers were sharply divided by the type of capacitor used by their DRAMs, and the relative cost and long-term scalability of both designs has been the subject of extensive debate. The majority of DRAMs, from major manufactures such as Hynix, Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics use the stacked capacitor structure, whereas smaller manufacturers such Nanya Technology use the trench capacitor structure (Jacob, pp. 355-357).|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{diagnostics}} {{and virtual}} imaging of damages in complex structures like <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> {{can help reduce}} the inspection time for guided wave based NDE and integrated SHM. <b>Folded</b> <b>plate</b> or box structure {{is one of the}} major structural components for increasing the structural strength. Damage in the <b>folded</b> <b>plate,</b> mostly in the form of surface breaking cracks in the inaccessible zone is a usual problem in aerospace structures. One side of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> is attached (either riveted or bonded) to adjacent structure which is not accessible for immediate inspection. The sensor-actuator network in the form of a circular array is placed on the accessible side of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate.</b> In the present work, a circular array is employed for scanning the entire <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> type structure for damage diagnosis and wave field visualization of entire structural panel. The method employs guided wave with relatively low frequency bandwidth of 100 - 300 kHz. Change in the response signal with respect to a baseline signal is used to construct a quantitative relationship with damage size parameters. Detecting damage in the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> by using this technique has significant potential for off-line and on-line SHM technologies. By employing this technique, surface breaking cracks on inaccessible face of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> are detected without disassembly of structure in a realistic environment...|$|E

40|$|General {{strategy}} for developing finite elements of general geometric shape explained on quadrilateral <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structure element ensuring invariance properties {{is presented in}} this paper. The basic idea of this strategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the element geometry and performing the element integration in a mapped biunit square. For defining the approximation functions a suitable local Cartesian coordinate system defined from the directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular contravariant base vectors is used. The origin of the local coordinate system {{is located at the}} element centroid (centre of gravity). Hybrid and boundary finite elements of reduced Trefftz type for analysing the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structures are also presented. The <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structure element is a combination of a plate bending element and a plane stress element. ...|$|E
