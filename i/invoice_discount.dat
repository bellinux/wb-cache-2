5000|$|Factoring is not {{the same}} as <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> (which is called an {{assignment}} of accounts receivable in American accounting - as propagated by FASB within GAAP). Factoring is the sale of receivables, whereas <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> ("assignment of accounts receivable" [...] in American accounting) is a borrowing that involves the use of the accounts receivable assets as collateral for the loan. However, in some other markets, such as the UK, <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> is considered to be a form of factoring, involving the [...] "assignment of receivables", that is included in official factoring statistics. It is therefore also not considered to be borrowing in the UK. In the UK the arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. In the UK, the main difference between factoring and <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> is confidentiality. Scots law differs from that of the rest of the UK, in that notification to the account debtor is required for the assignment to take place.

50|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} difficult for SMEs to obtain traditional finance from banks. Alternative options are <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> or factoring, whereby the company borrows against its outstanding invoices, with the ability to obtain funds as soon as new invoices are created. It is often questioned which option is best for your business - factoring or discounting - and the answer depends on how the business wants to be perceived by customers. With factoring, the finance company charges interest on the loan until the invoice is paid, as well as fees, and the finance company takes ownership of the debtor ledger and uses its own credit control team to secure payment. With <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting,</b> the business maintains control of its own ledger and chases debts itself.|$|R

Supply chains today are complex networks where members are heterogeneous (companies of several industrial sectors such as manufacturing, finance and logistics). These complex networks have to perform as a unique body; therefore, {{they need to be}} perfectly synchro- nised. In order to ensure continuous process monitoring and transparency, as well as accurate infor- mation flows, it is necessary to extend the electronic business relationship between manufacturers and their suppliers (B 2 B applications) towards those service providers, whose activities affect the quality of cooperation between business partners. [1] The FLUID-WIN research project targets business-to-business (B 2 B) manufacturing networks and their interactions with the logistics and financial service providers (FSP). The FLUID-WIN platform ensures the seamless integration of 3 rd party service providers with their manufacturing networks, based on easy-to-use electronic services, with the innovative B 2 (B 2 B) approach. FLUID-WIN research project aims to develop a platform which can seamlessly integrate and transfer data among all the various partners in order to enhance the competitiveness of the whole business sector in Europe and to make the business processes as efficient as possible.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how introducing economic variables into a credit scorecard improves the predictive power of that scorecard. Such a scorecard can forecast default rates accurately, even when economic conditions change. This means we {{can develop a}} single-step approach to estimate the point-in-time probabilities of default (PDs), which are required by the Basel Accords' banking regulations. A one-step approach has several advantages over the more standard approach, which involves first estimating scores with no economic variables, then segmenting the portfolio by score bands and estimating the PD per segment. To build such a scorecard, we decompose it into the population odds and weights of evidence. We show that economic variables model {{the dynamics of the}} population odds part of the scorecard, which leads to an improvement in prediction. We then apply this extension to credit scoring to a real problem in <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting.</b> This is when banks lend to small businesses using the invoices that the businesses have issued as collateral. There is a significant volume of such lending, but it is not often addressed in the literature. The scorecards used to assess the risk of default of such small businesses are very similar to the behavioral scorecards used to assess default risk in lending to consumers. The results show that modeling the population odds by economic variables is very effective, but there is little improvement in the scorecard's performance if we model the dynamics of the weights of evidence by adding interactions between the economic variables and the performance characteristics of the borrowing fir...|$|R
30|$|SME and Special Programs Department of Bangladesh Bank defines Small and Medium Enterprise as the {{business}} firm of service, business and industrial sector {{which is not}} a public limited company and rationed with its fixed assets other than land and building (not above BDT 3 200 million) and has limited employed manpower (not above 150). For the development of SME sectors, access to finance is vital. As SME entrepreneurs raise complain in many cases for the high rate of interest, Bangladesh Bank is committed to ease SME finance. SME finance is the funding of enterprises which represents a key function of {{the business}} finance market. The major functions of this market are supplying, acquiring and pricing of capital for SMEs. Generally, the business finance market supplies capital in the form of loan, credit and asset-based financing; say, factoring or <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting</b> and an enterprise can borrow fund in the form of bank loans from formal and informal financial institutions (FIs) to operate its business. A business finance market or credit market can be imperfect for asymmetric information that leads to credit rationing of a business. Asymmetric information makes credit market costly and difficult for banks to obtain correct information of borrowers (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981). In Bangladesh, we may classify the credit market into two ways, like rural and urban. A sizable part of the rural credit market is informal involving lending generally at the short term that includes traditional non-institutional ways of accumulating and extending capital. The major sources of informal lending are friends, relatives and kin members, landlords, neighbors, shopkeepers, marketing intermediaries, money lenders and other local income groups.|$|R

40|$|The Basel II accord regulates {{risk and}} capital {{management}} requirements {{to ensure that}} a bank holds enough capital proportional to the exposed risk of its lending practices. Under the advanced internal ratings based (IRB) approach, Basel II allows banks to develop their own empirical models based on historical data for probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). This thesis looks at some examples of modelling LGD and PD. One part of this thesis investigates modelling LGD for unsecured personal loans. LGD is estimated through estimating Recovery Rate (RR, RR= 1 -LGD). Firstly, the research examines whether it is better to estimate RR or Recovery Amounts. Linear regression and survival analysis models are built and compared when modelling RR and Recovery Amount, so as to predict LGD. Secondly, mixture distribution models are developed based on linear regression and survival analysis approaches. A comparison between single distribution models and mixture distribution models is made and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Thirdly, it is examined whether short-term recovery information is helpful in modelling final RR. It is found that early payment patterns and short-term RR after default are very significant variables in final RR prediction models. Thus, two-stage models are built. In the stage-one model short-term Recoveries are predicted, and then the predicted short-term Recoveries are used in the final RR prediction models. Fourthly, macroeconomic variables are added in both the short-term Recoveries models and final RR models, and the influences of macroeconomic environment on estimating RR are looked at. The other part of this thesis looks at PD modelling. One area where there is little literature of PD modelling is in <b>invoice</b> <b>discounting,</b> where a bank lends a company a proportion of the amount it has invoiced its customers in exchange for receiving the cash flow from these invoices. Default here means that the invoicing company defaults, at which point the bank cannot collect on the invoices. Like other small firms, the economic conditions affect the default risk of invoicing companies. The aim of this research is to develop estimates of default that incorporate the details of the firm, the current and past position concerning the invoices, and also economic variables.

40|$|Factoring {{contract}} {{is a new}} phenomenon, compared to earlier forms of commerce in juridical circulation. Factoring is a method used by a firm to obtain cash when available cash balance, held by the firm, is insufficient to meet current obligations, and accommodate its other cash needs, such as new orders or contracts. The use of factoring to obtain the cash, needed to accommodate the firm’s immediate cash needs, will allow the firm to maintain a smaller ongoing cash balance.

Many businesses have cash flow that varies. A business might have a relatively large cash flow in one period, as well as a relatively small cash flow in another period. Because of this, firms find it necessary to both keep a cash balance on hand, and use such methods as factoring, in order to enable them to cover their short term cash needs in those periods in which these needs exceed cash flow...|$|R

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 4. 5 million businesses employing less than 250 {{people in the}} UK, providing a total of 13. 7 million jobs, equating to half the private sector workforce in 2011. However, while such Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are of importance, it is their durability that can be considered of greater significance. The precarious nature of SME existence has been well documented. Only about 65 % of small businesses are still trading after {{the first three years}} of initial start-up. After five years, fewer than 45 % of businesses will have survived. Put simply, small firms are more likely to die than larger firms. Indeed, other than size per se, the higher likelihood of death is what distinguishes small from large firms. However, multiple failures can be experienced as the springboard for later success (provided learning takes place). Much of the research into small firms has focused on their failure. The danger of this approach is that it identifies what has gone wrong, but may fail to discover what they need to get right. The approach of the current study, then, is to focus on the triggers that lead to SME success, as a way of highlighting more effective strategy decisions for firms themselves, and to inform better policy decisions for government.
