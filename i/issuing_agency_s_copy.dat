A situation when one company sells its product {{at a very}} low price, intending to illegally drive competitors out of the market. Aim {{of this paper is}} to discuss mentioned issues in transport sector and to explain methods of solving predatory cases according to the newest guidelines of the European Commission, national competition au- thorities and national courts. Market delineation, dominance determination and predation cost analysis is discussed. Not only theoretical aspect of predatory behaviour and its impact on competition but also a detection of predatory pri- cing by authorities is discussed. Special attention to the specifics of transport sector is given. The core of this paper is an analysis of STUDENT <b>AGENCY,</b> <b>s.</b> r. o. case from year 2008, when mentioned company was accused of predatory pricing on their bus line Praha-Brno.

In this paper we generalize the problem to complete equipartite graphs K_(n:m) and show that K_(xyzw:m) can be decomposed into <b>s</b> <b>copies</b> of a 2 -factor consisting of cycles of length xzm; and r copies of a 2 -factor consisting of cycles of length yzm, whenever m is odd, s,r≠ 1, (x,z) =(y,z) = 1 and xyz≠ 0 4. We also give some more general constructions where the cycles in a given two factor may have different lengths. We use these constructions to find solutions to the Hamilton-Waterloo problem for complete graphs...|$|R

40|$|The federal role in precollege science, technology, engineering, and {{mathematics}} (STEM) education is receiving increasing attention {{in light of}} the need to support public understanding of science and to develop a strong scientific and technical workforce in a competitive global economy. Federal science agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), are being looked to as a resource for enhancing precollege STEM education and bringing more young people to scientific and technical careers. For NASA and other federal science agencies, concerns about workforce and public understanding of science also have an immediate local dimension. The agency faces an aerospace workforce skewed toward those close to retirement and job recruitment competition for those with science and engineering degrees. In addition, public support for the <b>agency</b> <b>s</b> missions stems in part from public understanding {{of the importance of the}} <b>agency</b> <b>s</b> contributions in science, engineering, and space exploration...|$|R
