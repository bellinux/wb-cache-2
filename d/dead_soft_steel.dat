500|$|Thorium metal has a {{bulk modulus}} (a measure of {{resistance}} to compression of a material) of 54GPa, {{about the same as}} tin's (58.2GPa).

Thorium is about as hard as <b>soft</b> <b>steel,</b> so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.|$|R
5000|$|Half-hard wire is {{slightly}} stiffer than <b>dead</b> <b>soft</b> wire. Half-hard wire is excellent for making tight, angular bends, for making loops in wire, and for wrapping wire around itself. However, {{it is not}} very useful for making spirals.

40|$|Many {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the electrical resistance of soft annealed metals is usually smaller than that of metals in their hard, cold worked state. By annealing cold-worked metals, the electrical resistance decreases to a minimum and then increases upon continued annealing at higher temperatures.

This was produced with a rose engine which laid down a circular pattern of symmetrical design onto a piece of <b>soft</b> <b>steel.</b> This was then partly cleared to leave a square shape and an area in the centre was further cleared {{in the shape of}} Queen Victoria's head ready for engraving.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>soft</b> wire is {{extremely}} soft and pliable. It {{can be easily}} bent and is excellent for making rounded shapes such as spirals. It is also excellent for wrapping wire around beads {{to make them look}} as though they are encased. The disadvantage of using soft wire is that the finished piece can be bent out of shape if not properly handled.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated <b>dead</b> <b>soft,</b> half-hard, or hard, where <b>dead</b> <b>soft</b> is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|R

50|$|As {{a safety}} {{precaution}} steel targets {{must be made}} out of hardened steel, which is more resistant to plastic deformation than regular, <b>soft</b> <b>steel.</b> For steel targets, the steel should have a Brinell value of 500 or more. One American producer of steel targets claims to only use steel with a hardness greater than 500, most often between 515-540. They also claim that the steel gets too brittle if higher Brinell values are used. Hardened steel are available in different Brinell values or thicknesses, and stainless variants are also available. A common trademark in USA for hardened steel is AR500.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} simplify the {{treatment}} of coolant in production systems, the superfinishing characteristics under the condition of water-solution type coolant are investigated experimentally. This type of coolant is inferior to an oil type coolant in removing chips from the stone because of its poor permeability. Electrolytic in-process dressing is applied to promote the self-dressing of diamond stone. As work materials, alumina which is sintered under atmospheric pressure and <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> (equivalent to 0. 15 % carbon steel) are used. The results obtained are as follows. Electrolytic in-process dressing {{makes it possible to}} use the coolant of water-solution in superfinishing. The suitable conditions in electrolytic in-process dressing depend on the machinability of work materials. The <b>soft</b> <b>steel</b> whose chips are easy to make a loading on the working surface of stone needs the stronger dressing. A concentration of some percent is sufficient for a coolant to maintain its essential properties. The electrolytic in-process dressing is more effective for harder or finer stone, because it can control the cutting ability of the stone...|$|R
