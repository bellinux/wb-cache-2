5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The {{aftermath}} of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> force in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{had come}} to regret his trade of Urban Shocker to the Browns. In St. Louis, the spitballer Shocker <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> his own as a starter, racking up four {{straight}} 20-win seasons in the years 1920-23 and leading the American League with 27 wins in 1921 and strikeouts the following year, when he won 24 games. Shocker was reacquired for Bullet Joe Bush, Milt Gaston and Joe Giard in December 1924.|$|E
5000|$|Here {{is another}} example of the Absurd from his writings: [...] What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> {{existence}} in time, that God <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> existence, <b>has</b> been born, has grown up. etc., <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, inasmuch as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.—Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210 ...|$|R

5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, {{for no other reason}} than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> being.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in various locations across Nottingham, United Kingdom including James Spence's house and The Bodega club night venue. This was because the band's producer, Sanderson <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contractual issues with the land owner of his recording studio. The album was critically acclaimed, praised for both its increased accessibility, sonic development and {{the increased use of}} Eva Spence's singing. However, the album performed poorly commercially, failing to chart or make significant sales in upon its release.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 2010, Dickov {{signed for}} Leeds United {{until the end}} of the season. It was {{initially}} thought that MLS side Toronto had beaten Leeds to Dickov's signature, however United eventually won the race for the Scot. Leeds also had to receive special dispensation from FIFA to sign Dickov due to the fact he had already played for two clubs this season, the maximum permitted. Dickov was named on Leeds' bench against Brentford and made his debut for Leeds when he came on as a late substitute. Made his impact as a Leeds player by getting booked immediately, scrapping with Brentford winger Ryan Dickson before the ball <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> play.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> question {{and the need for}} mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E

5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, the precinct {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake flood prevention work. The part of this land between {{the river and the}} Grand Union Canal was developed by the Town Council into a public space known as Abbey Park, which was opened by King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales) in 1882.|$|E
5|$|The NK 9th Division's {{infantry}} {{crossing of}} the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company, north of A Company. There the North Koreans assaulted in force, signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles. The company held its positions {{only a short time}} and then attempted to escape. Many of the men moved south, a few of them coming into A Company's ridge line positions near Agok during the night. Most of C Company moved {{all the way to the}} 25th Division positions south of the Naktong. On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> its lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates were valuable prizes but the Royal Navy only acquired Medée, {{which it}} took into service as HMS Medee, which it never commissioned but instead {{used as a}} prison ship {{for a few years}} before selling her in 1805. The frigates <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> port shortly before the Peace of Amiens and thus were deemed surplus to Navy requirements. The ships and their stores and equipment were sold privately; the proceeds from the sale were paid as prize money in February 1803. The British crews also benefited from head-money, a financial award for each French sailor captured during the engagement.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|In April 1337, Montagu was {{appointed}} to a diplomatic commission to Valenciennes, to establish alliances with Flanders and the German princes. In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing {{the greatest number of}} soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers. In September of that year he was made Marshal of England. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, this office <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the hands of Norfolk's daughter Margaret. The king did not trust the office with her husband, so he decided instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu. Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and when he left the Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the Earl of Derby. The earl had earlier voiced concerns about the costly alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Hitler <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> power, he {{had started}} to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able to stay ahead of Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with the tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop. The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.|$|E
