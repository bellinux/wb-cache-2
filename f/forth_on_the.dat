5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line, but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army <b>forth.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die with the others. At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E

25|$|Vijaya {{was made}} the prince-regent by his father, {{but he and}} his band of {{followers}} became notorious for their violent deeds. After their repeated complaints failed to stop Vijaya's acts, the prominent citizens demanded that Vijaya be put to death. King Sinhabahu then decided to expel Vijaya and his 700 followers from the kingdom. The men's heads were half-shaved and they were put on a ship that was sent <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea. The wives and children of these 700 men were also sent on separate ships. Vijaya had his followers landed at a place called Supparaka; the women landed at a place called Mahiladipaka, and the children landed at a place called Naggadipa. Vijaya's ship later reached Lanka, in the area known as Tambapanni, on the same day Gautama Buddha died in northern India. Those who believe that Vijaya set out from the west coat of India (i.e. Sinhapura was located in Gujarat) identify the present-day Sopara as the location of Supparaka. Those who believe that Sinhapura was located in Vanga-Kalinga region identify it with places located off the eastern coast of India. For example, S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar speculates that Supparaka might have been same as Sumatra.|$|E

[...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars {{could be seen in}} the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 26, 2008, Sánchez {{announced}} to her readers {{that the recent}} problems accessing her blog {{appeared to be a}} deliberate action on the part of government censors to block access to her blog and the other blogs on the desdecuba.com website.

500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} {{going to be on}} top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams thought {{it would be better to}} start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 59th Street Bridge.|$|E

500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities. Beyoncé noted that the album displayed [...] "sides of [...] {{that only a few}} people had seen", adding that [...] "all of us want happiness... sometimes {{you have to take the}} insecurities to get to the secure place. And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
