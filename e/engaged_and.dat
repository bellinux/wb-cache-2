5|$|On {{the early}} morning flight to Fornebu, Lent <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> shot down a Norwegian Gloster Gladiator. While the Ju52s {{transporting}} the German paratroops came under heavy fire, Lent's Rotte engaged the enemy ground positions. Lent's starboard engine caught fire, forcing him to land immediately. With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.|$|E

These forces were to be <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> thus prevented from coming to the aid of the Vilnius garrison.|$|E

5|$|Wittmann drove towards Villers-Bocage {{and along}} the road, the Rifle Brigade troops {{attempted}} to reply with PIAT anti-tank weapons and a 6-pounder anti-tank gun but, as the Tiger drew closer, panic set in and the riflemen looked for cover. The brigade vehicles were set on fire by machine guns and high-explosive shells, but few casualties were inflicted. At {{the east end of}} Villers-Bocage, Wittmann <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> knocked out three M5 Stuart light tanks of the 4th CLY Reconnaissance Troop.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named Alligator Reef. Her crew failed to refloat the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of Alligator final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, and his name was used as a rallying cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted {{until the end of the}} year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E

5|$|C Squadron, {{leading a}} brigade group, {{advanced}} towards Gambut {{on the morning}} of 23 November. On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the Matilda tanks to lead the column. C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E

In an effort to stem these depredations against American shipping several United States Navy warships were dispatched to hunt down French privateers.

Enterprise had been sent out to the Caribbean Sea in March 1800 with orders to cruise against French shipping in the region. Enterprise had already previously <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> defeated several French privateers when on the night of 24 October she sighted the privateer Flambeau off the leeward side of Dominica.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{fight with}} Joseph, Faye disappears to South Africa. Joseph and {{consultant}} Linden Cullen travel there to find her, and discover that Faye has a young son, Archie, who has Lowe syndrome. He has been kidnapped by his father, Faye's first husband Lucas, and Joseph is forced to operate on him to save his life. Faye and Joseph go on to become <b>engaged,</b> <b>and</b> marry at his family home. When Archie's nurse Lauren accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye is arrested for his murder when post-mortem results prove inconclusive, and is suspended from work. She is acquitted when Lauren confesses, and fights with the nurse, who attempts suicide. Faye is able to make her peace with Lauren, but is unable to fully forgive her. In the aftermath of Archie's death, Faye and Joseph grow apart, and she develops romantic feelings for Linden.|$|E
5|$|Following entreaties {{from the}} Greek polis of Tarentum in 281 BC, Pyrrhus, {{the king of}} Epirus in {{northern}} Greece, invaded Italy with an army of 25,500 and 20 war elephants. The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the Roman Republic, which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of Magna Graecia. Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia. Adding these forces to his own from Epirus, he <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum in 280 BC. The Epiriote victory caused a number of native {{groups such as the}} Samnites and the Lucanians, who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus. Subsequently, Pyrrhus advanced towards Rome and at the Battle of Asculum he vanquished another Roman army.|$|E

Swiss Alpine scenery inspired several poems, {{some of which were}} later published. In 1924 she met Walter Beck, a naturalised German employed by his family's cosmetics firm. The couple became <b>engaged,</b> <b>and</b> enjoyed regular weekends together, signing hotel registers as a married couple using false names.|$|E
