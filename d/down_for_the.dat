5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons.

5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay.
