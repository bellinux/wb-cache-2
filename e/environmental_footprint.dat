40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are {{to conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation into the theoretical and methodological aspects of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and into the disciplinary relationship with the latest science in defining planetary boundaries for human activities. Main conclusions are as follows: (1) <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> are measures of anthropogenic pressure or impact on the planet's environment irrespective of their precise units and dimensions; (2) <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> are classified into the inventory-oriented footprints and impact-oriented footprints, which offer two competing paradigms for footprint indicators; (3) integrating the impact-oriented footprints provides policy makers with a unified approach to assessing overall environmental impacts and has a broader scope of applicability than life cycle assessment; (4) life cycle assessment cannot {{be interpreted as a}} versatile tool for accounting for all possible <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints,</b> although the footprint community has indeed learned and borrowed much from it; (5) latest science in planetary boundaries is found to complement <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> in assessing <b>environmental</b> sustainability that is a critical prerequisite for the economic and social pillars of sustainable development; and (6) the sustainability gap between the converted footprint and boundary metrics plays a central role in understanding the national performance on individual and collective environmental issues...|$|R
40|$|While {{in recent}} years both <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and {{planetary}} boundaries have gained tremendous popularity throughout the ecological and environmental sciences, their relationship remains largely unexplored. By investigating the roots and developments of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries, this paper challenges {{the isolation of the}} two research fields and provides novel insights into the complementary use of them. Our analysis demonstrates that knowledge of planetary boundaries improves the policy relevance of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> by providing a set of consensus-based estimates of the regenerative and absorptive capacity at the global scale and, in reverse, that the planetary boundaries framework benefits from well-grounded footprint models which allow for more accurate and reliable estimates of human pressure on the planet's environment. A framework for integration of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries is thus proposed. The so-called footprint-boundary environmental sustainability assessment framework lays the foundation for evolving environmental impact assessment to environmental sustainability assessment aimed at measuring the sustainability gap between current magnitudes of human activities and associated capacity thresholds. As a first attempt to take advantage of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries in a complementary way, there remain many gaps in our knowledge. We have therefore formulated a research agenda for further scientific discussions, mainly including the development of measurable boundaries in relation to footprints at multiple scales and their trade-offs, and the harmonization of the footprint and boundary metrics in terms of environmental coverage and methodological choices. All these points raised, in our view, will {{play an important role in}} setting practical and tangible policy targets for adaptation and mitigation of worldwide environmental unsustainability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The European Commission (EC) has {{developed}} a reference method for organisation <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> (OEF) in support of improving the sustainability of production and consumption. This methodological development was guided by four core criteria. Specifically, it was deemed necessary that the method provides for a (1) multi-criteria, (2) life cycle-based approach that considers all organisational and related activities across the supply chain, (3) provides for reproducibility and comparability over flexibility, and (4) ensures physically realistic modelling. Methods Here, we review a subset of existing organisation <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> methods. We evaluate key areas of convergence (very limited!) and divergence between these methods, {{and the extent to}} which the methodological specifications they provide satisfy the four aforementioned criteria for the EC OEF method. On this basis, we specify where and why the EC OEF method necessarily diverges from and/or goes beyond the reviewed methods. Results and discussion We found little consistency between the reviewed methods, and few instances where our four criteria for the EC OEF method were satisfied. We specify the methodological norms for the EC OEF method for, among other things, definition of the unit of analysis (the organisation) and reference flow; organisation and analytical boundaries; cut-off criteria; impact categories and models; allocation solutions; and data quality. We further provide a rationale for each norm, in particular why they diverge from the various options presented in the reviewed methods. Conclusions In order to satisfy the four core criteria, the EC OEF method diverges from/goes beyond the reviewed methods in a variety of important respects. We suggest that the end result represents a significant advance in the standardization of life cycle-based organisation <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|While {{designing}} the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted {{over how to}} build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive [...] "V" [...] shape.

This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands, through {{what is now called}} the Eagles Nest Wilderness. After the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the thermal {{properties}} of asphalt binders and aggregate materials were characterized in terms of the specific heat capacity (C) for energy consumption and <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> of hot mix asphalt (HMA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA). Asphalt mixes produced using low-C aggregate are found to be more energy-efficient and environmental friendly, irrespective of the binder type and construction technology. Therefore, different fractions of aggregate blends were replaced with the aggregate provided from a low-C source or sustainable source. Analysis of energy consumption clearly indicated that the specific energy and <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> decrease linearly as the low-C aggregate content increases. The amount of energy saving realized in the asphalt industries by the use of low-C aggregate is significant on a national scale in China. In this regard, China was chosen as a case study. Analysis of fuel requirement clearly indicated that the production of WMA using high thermal sensitivity aggregate can yield significant energy saving sufficient to fuel 44, 007 to 664, 880 Chinese households per year. Therefore, use of low C aggregate in asphalt mix production can be adopted as a strategy to produce WMA and HMA...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The European Commission (EC) is {{currently}} developing a reference methodology for organisation <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> (OEF) {{in support of}} improving the sustainability of production and consumption. This methodological development is guided by four core criteria. Specifically, the methodology will provide for a (1) multi-criteria, (2) life cycle-based approach that considers all organisational and related activities across the value chain, (3) provides for reproducibility and comparability over flexibility, and (4) ensures physically realistic modelling. METHODS: Here, we review a subset of existing organisation <b>environmental</b> <b>footprinting</b> methods. We identify key areas of convergence and divergence between these methods, {{and the extent to}} which the methodological specifications they provide satisfy the four aforementioned criteria for a harmonised EC OEF methodology. On this basis, we specify where the EC OEF method must necessarily diverge from and/or go beyond the reviewed methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We specify recommended methodological norms for, among other things, definition of the unit of analysis (the organisation) and reference flow; organisation and analytical boundaries; cut-off criteria; impact categories and models; allocation solutions; and data quality management. We further provide a rationale for the recommended alternative requirements to be adopted for EC OEF compliant studies.
