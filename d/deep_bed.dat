Twenty four animals in the growth phase were distributed in a randomized block design in three treatments: T 1 - concrete floor, T 2 - <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> with wood shaving, and T 3 - <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> with coffee husks. The behavioral study {{was carried out by}} observing the animal behavior for an uninterrupted period of eight hours throughout seven weeks. The proportions of time spent in each behavior were characterized using the frequency histogram composition. Environmental (IBGTH), physiological (rectal and skin temperature and respiratory rate) and performance (weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion) parameters were measured in animals during the period. The production systems of <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> showed higher values of IBGTH. There was no effect of production systems evaluated on the performance parameters. Rectal temperature was higher in animals reared on <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> with coffee husks in relation to the concrete floor.

The activities of each experimental group were registered daily at 08 : 00, 11 : 00 and 15 : 00 hours; as well the individual activities of 5 pigs per treatment. The animal behavior {{before and after the}} pigs reached 50 kg life weight (growing and fattening phases) were determined. An effect of the animal density on the animal behavior of pigs was observed. The treatment with lower animal density (1. 5 m 2 /animal) showed the highest both percentage of pigs eating during the feeding hours andresting pigs after fed. Pigs established three well differentiated areas of the <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> substrate: dirty area,humid area and resting area independently of animal density or substrate density. Additionally, the pigs established fed and resting areas. In conclusion, the <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> system using empty fruit branches of oil palm offers well animal welfare and allows pigs to determine favorable behavior during the growing-fattening phase...|$|R

40|$|Variability in the {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} seagrass-associated fish assemblages was examined at different depths in a temperate bay in southern Australia. Depth differences in seagrass-associated fish assemblages are poorly known but this information is critical given that seagrass loss can occur at specific depths depending on the cause. Overall, 69 species of fish from 26 families were recorded, with higher species richness in shallow than <b>deep</b> <b>beds,</b> with 12 species found only in <b>deep</b> <b>beds</b> and 22 species found only in shallow beds. While the total fish abundance (i. e. abundance of all species recorded) varied between years and seasons, {{and to some extent}} between sites, it was significantly higher in shallow than <b>deep</b> seagrass <b>beds</b> in the majority of cases. Although there was some variation between sites, seagrass tended to be longer and have a higher biomass in shallow than <b>deep</b> <b>beds</b> during both spring and autumn throughout the study. A positive relationship between seagrass biomass/length and total fish abundance/species richness was apparent. Assemblage structure tended to be distinct at each depth, with the largest species recorded in shallow seagrass. Large numbers of small schooling fish, such as atherinids, dominated in shallow seagrass but were not found in deep seagrass. Loss of seagrass could therefore have varying implications for distinct assemblages found at different depths...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} different bedding depths on the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the bedding material used to raise pigs during growing and finishing. The experiment was conducted in two pens housing 5 pigs from 60 to 145 days of age, with rice husk beddings 0. 50 or 0. 25 m deep. Four lots of pigs (replicates) were raised over time in each bedding depth: each bedding was used by two consecutive lots. Bedding samples were collected quarterly to determine the most probable number (MPN) of thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Contents of N, P, K, C, organic, mineral and dry matter, C:N ratio and pH were also determined. The MPN of thermophilic bacteria was higher for the 0. 50 m than for the 0. 25 m bedding (p < 0. 05). The compost of 0. 25 m <b>deep</b> <b>bedding</b> had a higher N, P and K content than that from the 0. 50 m bedding (p < 0. 05).

This parrot had the old Creole gentleman living with it who owned the island, and whom it had brought from New Orleans.

For no reason under the sun they were afraid of him; perhaps they thought he resented their parleys with the parrot.

6000|$|The {{first effect}} of this humid wind is to clothe Sikkim with forests, that make it moister still; and however {{difficult}} it is to separate cause from effect in such cases as those of the reciprocal action of humidity on vegetation, and vegetation on humidity, it is necessary for the observer to consider the one as the effect of the other. There is no doubt that but for the humidity of the region, the Sikkim Himalaya would not present the uniform clothing of forest that it does; and, on the other hand, that but for this vegetation, the relative humidity would not be so great.* [Balloon ascents and observations on small mountainous islands, therefore, offer the best means of solving such questions: of these, the results of ballooning, under Mr. Welsh's intrepid and skilful pioneering (see Phil. Trans. for 1853), have proved most satisfactory; though, from the time for observation being short, and from the interference of belts of vapour, some anomalies have not been eliminated. Islands again are still more exposed to local influences, which may be easily eliminated in a long series of observations. I think that were two islands, as different in their physical characters as St. Helena and Ascension, selected for comparative observations, at various elevations, the laws that regulate the distribution of humidity in the upper regions might be deduced without difficulty. They are advantageous sites, from differing remarkably in their humidity. Owing partly to the indestructible nature of its component rock (a glassy basalt), the lower parts of Ascension have never yielded to the corroding effects of the moist sea air which surrounds it; which has decomposed the upper part into a <b>deep</b> <b>bed</b> of clay. Hence Ascension does not support a native tree, or even shrub, two feet high. St. Helena, on the other hand, which can hardly be considered more favourably situated for humidity, was clothed with a redundant vegetation when discovered, and trees and tree-ferns (types of humidity) still spread over its loftiest summits. Here the humidity, vegetation, and mineral and mechanical composition reciprocate their influences.] ...|$|E

The most prevalent lesions were heel/sole bruising (7. 1 %), heel/sole erosion (10. 8 %), heel flaps (8. 4 %) and toe erosion (11. 6 %). Pigs were kept on either solid (41 %), partly slatted (28 %) or fully slatted (31 %) floors.
