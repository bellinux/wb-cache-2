5000|$|When the <b>fin</b> <b>keeled</b> {{and lifting}} keel HEOLs have raced each other, the <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> {{model has been}} shown to only have a slight edge. In low or no wind conditions, the {{windward}} appendage that is the lifted keel of the twin keel model adds slight drag. In strong wind conditions, the difference is even smaller, and an astute twin keel crew can [...] "take" [...] a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> crew if the <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> crew becomes momentarily lax.|$|R
50|$|Once motion {{has been}} established, the motion {{itself can be}} {{controlled}} {{with the use of}} other fins.

2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full <b>keels,</b> long <b>keels,</b> <b>fin</b> <b>keels,</b> winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R

50|$|The V-12 Hispano {{engine was}} {{mounted in the}} nose behind a large {{radiator}} fitted with vanes to control the engine temperature. The engine mounting {{and the rest of}} the fuselage structure was built from molybdenum-chrome steel tubes. Behind the engine, which had a metal cowling, the outer fuselage form was set by wooden frames and stringers, then covered in fabric. The two open cockpits were in tandem, with the pilot just aft of the upper wing and the observer close behind. His position was equipped for wireless and photography as well as with a pair of flexibly mounted machine guns. The pilot controlled two more fixed guns which fired through the propeller disc. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a narrow chord, rectangular tailplane mounting broader, blunt ended, balanced, separate elevators. Its much larger, rounded vertical tail had a broad-chord fin and generous, balanced rudder which extended to the <b>keel.</b> <b>Fin</b> and tailplane were braced together with twin parallel wires on each side.|$|E

As a result, the final performances of the yacht are also influenced by the structural behavior of the fin. For this problem we study and compare a suite of different MDO formulations. The optimal design problem is finally tackled considering a Global Optimization (GO) problem within a MDO framework. MDO both includes difficult theoretical and computational aspects, determined by the simultaneous solution of different disciplines affecting each other, and by the related solvers involved all at once in the convergence of the overall optimization framework. We first introduce and describe some MDO approaches from the literature. Then, we consider our MDO scheme where we deal with the GO box constrained problem min_a R. In general, the objective function f(x) is non-linear and non-convex and, in simulation based design approaches, also costly. We also assume that the solution of the problem requires the use of a derivative-free method since the derivatives of f(x) are unavailable and/or the function must be treated as a ‘black-box’ (see [30] and [23], [40]). Within this framework we study some globally convergent modifications of the evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm [24], suitably adapted for box-constrained optimization. To this purpose we adopt both the theory described in [27] for exact methods, and the generalized PSO scheme [10], which includes the standard PSO scheme. Finally, we report our numerical experience for the design of the sailing yacht elastic <b>keel</b> <b>fin...</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a formulation for multidisciplinary design optimization of vessels, subject to uncertain operating conditions. The formulation couples the multidisciplinary design analysis with the Bayesian approach to decision problems affected by uncertainty. In the present context, the design specifications {{are no longer}} given {{in terms of a}} single operating design point, but in terms of probability density function of the operating scenario. The optimal configuration is that which maximizes the performance expectation over the uncertain parameters variation. In this sense, the optimal solution is “robust” within the stochastic scenario assumed. Theoretical and numerical issues are addressed and numerical results in the hydroelastic optimization of a <b>keel</b> <b>fin</b> of a sailing yacht are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} is presented for efficient simulation-based Multidisciplinary Robust Design Optimization (MRDO) of steady fluid-structure interaction problems, affected by uncertainty. The {{focus is on}} a racing-sailboat <b>keel</b> <b>fin,</b> subject to stochastic operating conditions. The elastic deformation of the fin, induced by hydrodynamic loads, cannot be neglected while evaluating the hydrodynamic performances, thus a fully coupled hydroelastic problem is considered, including fluid mechanics (CFD) and structural analysis (FEM). The multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) identifies the steady multidisciplinary state by numerical iterations. Stochastic operating conditions are given in terms of probability density function of the yaw angle. The objective function is the expected value of the fin efficiency over the stochastic operating conditions, whereas the design variables pertain to the fin geometry. Distributions of the relevant outputs are evaluated using uncertainty quantification methods (UQ), requiring {{a large number of}} multidisciplinary analyses (MDA). Solving the MRDO problem represents a challenge from the algorithmic and computational viewpoints, requiring: (1) a minimization algorithm, (2) a UQ tool and (3) simulation-based MDAs. Herein, the MDA is solved with a variable level of coupling between the disciplines involved; the UQ is carried out using the Monte Carlo method with a variable level of accuracy; the design optimization is solved using subsequent design of experiments (DoE), thin-plate spline metamodels, and particle swarm optimizations (PSO). Results are compared to benchmark solutions, given by fully coupled MDA, fully convergent UQ and optimization without metamodels, showing a close agreement and requiring the 50 % of the benchmark computational cost...|$|E

50|$|Bilge keels {{are often}} fitted to smaller sailing yachts.

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length <b>keel,</b> a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|R
