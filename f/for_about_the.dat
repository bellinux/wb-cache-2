5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom on vinyl in mid-December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later. A gatefold cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> price of a single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.|$|E

5|$|Business Spur Interstate 75(BS I-75) is a {{business}} spur running through Bay City following {{a section of the}} current routing of M-25 through town. Formerly a full business loop numbered Business Loop Interstate75 (BL I-75), it followed what is now M-84 back to end at I-75/US23 at exit160 south of downtown. The business route also follows streets that previously were numbered Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23). The spur starts at exit162 on I-75/US23 at the same interchange where M-25 and US10 end. BS I-75 runs concurrently along M-25, and <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first , the spur is a four-lane freeway bounded by residential subdivisions on either side. In Bangor Township, the freeway ends and BS I-75/M-25 splits into a one-way pairing of Thomas Street (eastbound) and Jenny Street (westbound). These two three-lane streets continue along a residential area {{on the west side of}} Bay City. East of intersections with Henry Street, the opposing sides of traffic merge back together near Veterans Memorial Park to cross the Saginaw River on the four-lane Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the eastern side of the river, BS I-75/M-25 splits again into the one-way pairing of the three-lane McKinley Street (westbound) and 7th Street (eastbound). Just three blocks east of the river, BS I-75 ends at the intersections with M-84 (Washington Avenue) in downtown Bay City. On average each day in 2013, 11,678vehicles use the business loop east of the M-13 junction, and 29,391vehicles do so west of the M-84 junction, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching <b>for</b> <b>about</b> , <b>the</b> battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker, so Allen ordered his men to pull back and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered his men to pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Standing at the North Kamloops station, {{the train}} is {{actually}} facing north and will be travelling north, {{at least in a}} northerly direction, <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> next six hours. The train follows the North Thompson River for much of the way, crossing it several times. The scenery changes gradually from the dry, rolling plateau – though miles of irrigation soften the starkness – to the lusher, evergreen forests farther north. Narrow valleys bordered by mountains on both sides feature farmlands, pastures, forests, logging camps, and small communities. Clearwater and Blue River are two such communities where the Canadian has flag stops. Near Clearwater, the train crosses the Clearwater River. The Monashee Mountains lie to the east for much of the way to Valemount.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} {{settlement}} by the British in 1625, through history {{the economy of}} Barbados was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using indentured labour mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton crops were first introduced. The island, facing {{a large amount of}} competition from the North American colonies and the neighbouring West Indian islands, switched to the crop of sugar cane. Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled Jewish community which immigrated into Barbados from Dutch Brazil during the mid-17th century. The introduction of sugar cane became the single best move for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the Netherlands. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production caught up in geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 20th century and to this day.|$|E

500|$|The Parthians largely {{adopted the}} art, architecture, {{religious}} beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed Persian, Hellenistic, and regional cultures. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of}} its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions.

The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris (south of modern Baghdad, Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals.|$|E

[...] In 1929, Hergé began The Adventures of Tintin comic strip <b>for</b> , <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exploits of fictional young Belgian reporter Tintin. [...] Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union to act as anti-socialist propaganda for children (Tintin in the Land of the Soviets), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (Tintin in the Congo), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (Tintin in America). On 24 November 1932, Le Petit Vingtième published a fictional interview with Tintin in which the reporter {{announced that he would}} travel to China via Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, and Indochina. This plotline resulted in Tintin in the Orient, the first part of which was an Adventure set in Egypt, Arabia, and India that Hergé later titled Cigars of the Pharaoh.
