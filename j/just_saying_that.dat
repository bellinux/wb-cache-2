500|$|So ... {{what have}} you listened to for a good time that isn't, after all, a 'traditional' song? Still playing the Mike Oldfield records, huh? Still {{whipping}} Yessongs on for a good time? Wanna count on one hand {{how many people have}} fun at a Sonic Youth gig? I'm not supporting The Choirboys, old man, I'm <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist cocksucker puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer {{in the middle of his}} 47-minute opus [...] "The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig-God" [...] and belts out the chords to [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] is the day I'll join you at the footlights of post-modernism.|$|E
2500|$|The figure {{shows an}} example of allochiria in the clock drawing of a patient with hemispatial neglect. The patient omitted {{the left side of}} objects when drawing a clock. [...] Even though the patient could {{verbally}} express that the clock face has a left side, he or she would fail to notice that the drawing was incomplete. This implies that drawing tasks can {{play an important role in}} differentiating the specific impairment of the brain lesion, and not <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> a patient has dementia.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{says the}} text from Ecclesiastes should [...] "awaken you to concern about yourself." [...] "The {{thought of the}} Creator is youth's most {{beautiful}} splendor" [...] and the Preacher [...] "is not <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> you can think about your Creator, but he admonishes you to do it; {{and if you are}} young, whether you are joyful or dejected; whether you are carefree or discouraged, whoever you are, it is nevertheless to you, precisely to you, that he is speaking, you to whom the admonition applies ...|$|E

2500|$|In a well-ordered set, every {{non-empty}} subset contains a distinct smallest element. [...] Given the axiom of dependent choice, this {{is equivalent to}} <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the set is totally ordered {{and there is no}} infinite decreasing sequence, something perhaps easier to visualize. In practice, the importance of well-ordering is justified by the possibility of applying transfinite induction, which says, essentially, that any property that passes on from the predecessors of an element to that element itself must be true of all elements (of the given well-ordered set). [...] If the states of a computation (computer program or game) can be well-ordered {{in such a way that}} each step is followed by a [...] "lower" [...] step, then the computation will terminate.|$|E
2500|$|The song is one out {{of three}} Elliott-produced records on After the Storm, {{commissioned}} by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album Under Construction (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album All Eyez on Me the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This {{is the end of the}} road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record." [...] Commenting on the recording process, she added: [...] "She [...] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she could care less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Democratic {{critics of}} Bush {{suggested}} that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media's reporting on Bush's National Guard service. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, {{suggested that the}} memos might have originated with long-time Bush strategist Karl Rove. McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, [...] "I {{can tell you that}} nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents," [...] he said. [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I would ask Karl Rove the same question." [...] McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, Ralph E. Reed, Jr., had [...] "a known history of dirty tricks," [...] and he asked whether Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant Roger Stone. At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: [...] "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away." [...] After being criticized, Hinchey responded, [...] "I didn't allege I had any facts. I said this is what I believe and take it for what it's worth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaspin {{was happy}} with the settlement, but {{nevertheless}} agreed with one of O'Brien's points—that his show {{had no time to}} grow: [...] "Could it have grown? Absolutely... We just couldn't give him the time." [...] Zucker, in an interview with Charlie Rose, defended his strategy but noted that both shows were a mistake. Zucker, who had known O'Brien since their days at Harvard and was very close friends with Ross, was too very disappointed with how events played out, although he viewed it necessary. Leno, in an attempt to repair his public perception, granted an interview with Oprah Winfrey on January 25; he stripped himself of any blame for O'Brien's disappointment, noting that it was all about ratings, and also confirmed that he told a [...] "white lie" [...] in 2004 when he guaranteed The Tonight Show to O'Brien. In a reference to a 2007 Super Bowl commercial starring Letterman and Winfrey (the two had feuded for years prior), Letterman, Leno and Winfrey all appeared in a spot airing during Super Bowl XLIV in February 2010. The ad—Letterman's idea—was the first time the late-night hosts had met since their own 1992 debacle. In it, Letterman and Leno sit on opposite sides of Winfrey watching the game; Letterman deems it [...] "the worst Super Bowl party ever" [...] due to Leno's inclusion, and Winfrey tells him to [...] "be nice", resulting in a quip from Leno: [...] "Oh, he's <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> 'cause I'm here." [...] The clip stirred a Web frenzy, with commentators speculating that Leno had been [...] "green-screened" [...] into the picture.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like that, you always have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow! Very, very impressive.” ...|$|E
