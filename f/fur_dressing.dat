5000|$|Human {{beings have}} been wearing fur since the {{beginning}} of time. There is evidence that Ötzi, the Iceman, was wearing a pelt when he met his demise 5000 years ago. [...] In classic antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans all used fur or pelts in clothing. [...] In Western Europe, beginning in the 11th Century, luxury furs such as ermine, mink, sable, and chinchilla were reserved for the royalty, nobility, high ranking clergy, and the bourgeoisie. [...] Fur and the access to it became a way of sublimating the lower classes in the 16th and 17th centuries and were strictly controlled. [...] The North American fur trade, during the 17th and 18th centuries, provided enough pelts of hare, rabbit, lamb, and wolf to appeal to the crowd that could not afford the luxury furs, which remained to be only accessible to the elite. [...] The royal families of Europe frequently use ermine to create robes and line their crowns. However, before the 19th century, fur was used as accents, like linings, accessories, and for trimming gowns. [...] Full fur jackets did not appear on the fashion scene until the mid-19th century as a display of wealth by the newly prosperous middle class. Seal skin {{was one of the first}} furs to be used for a coat. [...] Fashion went through waves of monkeys, mice, and cat <b>fur</b> <b>dressing</b> during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The turn of the century focused on the exotic animals like lions, tigers, leopards, and polar bear fur. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, stopped the exotic animal fur market and the later part of the 20th century focused once again on more accessible fur like rabbit. [...] Today, fur is a very controversial issue with groups like PETA protesting the entire fur industry and designers, like Armani, have decided to go [...] "fur free." ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{contemporary}} areas of Alaska, Mara Wade (Lori Saunders) is a wild woman {{whose parents are}} killed in a Bear attack. Raised by wolves and wearing only a <b>fur</b> <b>dress,</b> she rescues and befriends an anthropologist named Ken Williams (Adam West) who is interested in teaching her {{what is in the}} world. But she is hunted as well by a ruthless carnival worker named Jarnagan (Theodore Marcuse) causing Ken to work to keep her safe.|$|R
2500|$|Since 1889, Mrs. Claus {{has been}} {{generally}} depicted in media as a fairly heavy-set, kindly, white-haired elderly female baking cookies {{somewhere in the}} background of the Santa Claus mythos. She sometimes assists in toy production, and oversees Santa's elves. It is worth noting that, when not portrayed as white-haired or elderly, she is often shown to have red hair. This could be because red hair is the color that most commonly fades to white with age. [...] She is usually depicted wearing a <b>fur</b> <b>dress</b> of red or green.|$|R
25|$|During {{the winter}} people wore cotton-wadded <b>dresses.</b> <b>Fur</b> was also common. Because {{ordinary}} people normally wore pure white undyed materials, {{the people were}} {{sometimes referred to as}} the white-clad people.|$|R
5000|$|This entire ghetto was {{producing}} <b>fur</b> coats, <b>dresses,</b> and the like. Whenever {{we tried to}} get at it in the past we were told: Stop! Armaments factory! Of course, {{this has nothing to do}} with Party Comrade Speer. It wasn't your doing. It is this portion of alleged armaments factories that Party Comrade Speer and I intend to clear out in the next few weeks.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} pages {{containing}} the introductory clauses, the pages are ruled with a single column and contain a priced inventory of laces, jewelry, <b>furs,</b> embroideries, <b>dressing</b> bags and objects of art. A large number of the articles are explained in footnotes. A {{large part of the}} will is in Cook's own handwriting. It is dated 17 October 1919, but there is a codicil dated 2 March 1924.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, the Southern Altay Section of the Institute of Archaeology of Novosibirsk {{excavated}} a "frozen tomb" at Ak-Alakha (2500 m above sea level). The burial pit (5 x 5 m) and the funerary chamber were preserved. Nine sacrificed horses were found, with their horse trappings similar to Pazyryk. A {{man and a woman}} were buried in two wooden sarcophagi. Felt and <b>fur</b> <b>dresses</b> as well as daggers, bows and arrows were deposited in the sarcophagi. A carved piece of quiver depicted two tigers attacking a boar. The high and complex headdresses in felt, were decorated with birds and deer in wood gilted with gold foil. The saddles were decorated with ornaments representing fish. The representations of Ak-Alakha are similar to the royal kurgans of Tuekta, Bashadar and Pazyryk art, but belonged probably to people of the small nobility of a higher class than the deceased of Ulandryk, Justyd and Bashanta.

50|$|A rather narcissistic duck. He is {{a superstar}} singer and often holds concerts at the Green-Green Grassland. Wolffy {{is a great}} fan of his, in one episode {{dressing}} in drag to get his autograph. But this is often contradicted, {{such as in the}} episode where Wolffy kidnaps Bian Zui Lun, shaves him and uses his <b>fur</b> to <b>dress</b> up as him and gain access to the goats. His name is parody of Zhou Jielun (Jay Chou).|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Helen co-created {{alongside}} her biologist sister, Kate Storey, the project Primitive Streak, a science-art collaboration elucidating eleven key events in human embryonic development. Primitive Streak {{is a collection}} of twenty seven dresses, which brings these eleven key events to life in textile form. [...] First funded by the Wellcome Trust, Primitive Streak made its debut at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1997. The exhibition has since gone on to win two awards, has toured in seven countries and has been seen by five million people. In 2015 the new Reading Room at Wellcome Collection in London showcases the Red <b>Fur</b> Implantation <b>Dress.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hester has olive-colored skin, messy, dirty {{brown hair}} and brown eyes. Hester's style is {{described}} as pretty nerdy. She wears cat t-shirts, floral skirts and a bad nylon tracksuit jacket from the '80s. Hester also wears a neck brace because of her scoliosis. Chanel calls her [...] "Neckbrace" [...] because of this. As Chanel #6, Hester wears Chanel's white and pastel glamour <b>dresses,</b> <b>fur</b> coats and sparkly high platforms.|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1953, the Bill Williams Mountain Men of Williams, Arizona are a {{group of}} {{business}} men, doctors, judges and ranchers who re-enact the life and rides of nineteenth-century <b>fur</b> trappers.

The Bill Williams Mountain Men explore the mountains, canyons, and deserts of Arizona during their annual spring 200-mile Rendezvous Ride, held since they organized in 1980.|$|R
60|$|But besides these common habits, {{they have}} {{official}} and ceremonious occasions, {{on which they}} wear beautiful <b>furs</b> and theatrical <b>dresses</b> and disguises, including large masks; and their war-dress, formed of a thick doubled leathern mantle of elk or buffalo skin, frequently with a cloak over it, on which the hoofs of horses were strung, makes an almost impervious cuirass. Their love for music, general lively dispositions, except from provocation, but determination in avenging insult or wrong, is testified by all.|$|R
60|$|The United States import from South America, nutria, vicunia, chinchilla, {{and a few}} deer-skins; also {{fur seals}} from the Lobos Islands, off the river Plate. A {{quantity}} of beaver, otter, &c., are brought annually from Santa Fe. <b>Dressed</b> <b>furs</b> for edgings, linings, caps, muffs, &c., such as squirrel, genet, fitch-skins, and blue rabbit, are received from the north of Europe; also cony and hare's fur; but the largest importations are from London, where is concentrated nearly {{the whole of the}} North American fur trade.|$|R
40|$|Helen and Kate Storey’s Red <b>Fur</b> Neuralation <b>Dress,</b> {{from the}} Primitive Streak collection, {{originally}} created in 1997, is now permanently on {{show in the}} new Reading Room at Wellcome Collection, and {{opened to the public}} February 2015. Primitive streak is a science-art collaboration elucidating 10 key events in human embryonic development by artist/designer Helen Storey (London College of Fashion) and biologist Kate Storey (University of Dundee). Helen and Kate first collaborated on the project in 1997 to create a series of fashion/textile designs, spanning the first 1, 000 hours of human life. Producing these at London College of Fashion, Helen and Kate worked interactively using design at multiple levels to evoke the key embryonic processes that underlie our development. Elucidating the first 1, 000 hours of human life in fashion and textiles. This collection has been touring for 11 years, and has been seen by 5 million people in 8 countries. 14 years on, Helen and Kate collaborated again to produce new dresses, which explore the science behind the development and function of the lungs. The full collection was 27 dresses, of which 10 toured in 2011. www. primitive-streak. or...|$|R
40|$|Blocked in Paris in 1939 {{en route}} to South America, Andrzej Bobkowski (1913 - 1961), Polish writer and essayist, holds a diary {{during the period of}} German occupation. This {{document}} of great value, published in French in 1991, is rich in cultural, philosophical and literary references. It also provides fascinating details and observations on daily life of Parisians under the Nazi boot where fashion and elegance every day become a sort of aesthetic response to the situation and a patriotic duty. Fantasy hats and wooden soled shoes, rabbit <b>furs</b> and couture <b>dresses,</b> skirts for cyclists and legs painted {{due to the lack of}} silk stockings – French fashion dark years succeeded in combining creativity, comfort and chic to remain faithful to the ideal of beauty and femininity...|$|R
5000|$|She {{was not a}} fascist—ignorant, perhaps, of {{what that}} {{ideology}} meant. And she was not greedy. Though she liked jewelry, <b>furs</b> and Dior <b>dresses,</b> she could own as many as she desired without the need to rob others.... In 1964 Jorge Luis Borges stated that 'the mother of that woman Evita' was 'the madam of a whorehouse in Junín.' He repeated the calumny so often that some still believe it or, more commonly, think Evita herself, whose lack of sex appeal is mentioned by all who knew her, apprenticed in that imaginary brothel. Around 1955 the pamphleteer Silvano Santander employed the same strategy to concoct letters in which Evita figures as an accomplice of the Nazis. It is true that (Juan) Perón facilitated the entrance of Nazi criminals to Argentina in 1947 and 1948, thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war. But Evita played no part.|$|R
60|$|The Ostjak men {{arrived just}} before it became dark. They wore high flat-topped <b>fur</b> caps, a <b>dress</b> {{something}} like a long loose blouse, and trousers of fine leather tucked into boots that {{came up to the}} knee. Most of them had bows and arrows in addition to their fishing gear. Godfrey felt no uneasiness among these men as he would have done among the Buriats in the east, for they were now at a distance from any convict settlements, and these people would know nothing about the rewards offered to the natives in the neighbourhood of the mines for the arrest of prisoners. A present of some tobacco, of which Godfrey had laid in a large stock, put the Ostjaks into an excellent temper. Fish were broiling over the fire when they returned, and the two travellers joined them at their meal. After this was over and pipes lighted the subject of the boat was discussed. The Ostjaks were perfectly ready to trade. They said they would sell any of their six boats for three roubles, and that if they did not think any of these large enough they would build them a larger one in three days for six roubles.|$|R
