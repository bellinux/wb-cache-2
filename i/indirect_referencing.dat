40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{wanted to write a}} macro and not have to specify input parameters? Have you wanted to write a global macro that can be used with {{different}} data sets without having to know the content of key variables? For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, standardization is always a goal. The same reports are repeatedly needed but the study data that is used in the reports is often slightly different with a different study design or different number of arms or cohorts. The macro facility is helpful in achieving standardization and one tool within this facility that makes this possible is <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing</b> to macro variables. It is a very useful and powerful concept but may not be well known to even the most experienced SAS ® programmers. This paper uses examples to demonstrate this concept, along with how the macro processor resolves macro variables with multiple ampersands, {{and the use of the}} SYMPUT routine using DATA step variables and expressions for both arguments to produce multiple macro variables. It will show the progression of taking awkward code and condensing it with use of the SYMPUT routine and <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing.</b> All examples shown were done in the SAS system for PCs, version 8. 2. The intended audience for this paper is advanced level SAS programmers...|$|E
40|$|Runtime {{reconfiguration}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement of many telecommunication applications which also has been addressed by management standards like CMIP, 3 GPP TS 32. 602, and NETCONF. Two basic commands considered by these standards are CREATE and DELETE which operate on managed objects inside an application. The available configuration management technologies, like JMX, OSGi, and Fractal, {{do not support the}} CREATE and DELETE reconfiguration commands of the telecommunication standards. In this paper, we introduce a novel technology, called RSCM, for development of runtime reconfigurable applications complying with the telecommunication standards. The RSCM subagent takes the responsibility of loading the application from the configuration file, executing the runtime reconfiguration commands (including CREATE and DELETE), enforcing validity of the configuration state, and updating the configuration file according to the latest reconfiguration commands. We exploit the modular and object oriented features of the XML technology for storing the configuration state of a program in a configuration file. The software development process is tailored such that the design of XML schemas of managed classes is performed parallel to the design of software classes. In addition, a novel programming approach based on <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing</b> is proposed which allows safe and almost immediate deletion of managed objects at runtime. This <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing</b> mechanism affects the implementation of associations in class diagrams and prevents methods of a class to use the this pointer freely.

40|$|Abstract — Aliasing {{occurs when}} two {{variables}} {{refer to the}} same memory location. This technique has been exploited for constructing resilient obfuscation transforms in languages that extensively use <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing.</b> The theoretical basis for these transforms {{is derived from the}} hard complexity results of precisely determining which set of variables refer to the same memory location at a given program point during execution. However, no method is known for randomly generating hard problem instances. Unless we are able to evaluate the obfuscatory strength of these transforms using static analysis tools, we cannot correlate the resilience expected in theory with what actually holds in practice. In this contribution, we will outline the main difficulties in experimentally evaluating obfuscatory strength and give an overview of techniques that are suited for analysing wellestablished alias-based obfuscation transforms.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{published}} {{as part of}} a Dalton Transactions themed issue on: The Synergy between Theory and Experiment"Ni- 61 chemical shifts of Ni(all-trans-cdt) L (cdt = cyclododecatriene, L = none, CO, PMe 3), Ni(CO) (4), Ni(C 2 H 4) (2) (PMe 3), Ni(cod) (2) (cod = cyclooctadiene) and Ni(PX 3) (4) (X = Me, F, Cl) are computed at the GIAO (gauge-including atomic orbitals), BPW 91, B 3 LYP and BHandHLYP levels, using BP 86 -optimised geometries and an <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing</b> scheme. For this set of compounds, substituent effects on delta(Ni- 61) are better described with hybrid functionals than with the pure BPW 91 functional. On going from Ni(all-trans-cdt) to Ni(all-cis-cdt) the computations predict substantial shielding of the Ni- 61 nucleus by nearly 700 ppm, as well as a sharp increase of the electric field gradient at this position. The latter result is predicted to afford an undetectably broad Ni- 61 NMR line for the all-cis-cdt complex, rationalizing the apparent failure to record the NMR spectrum experimentally.

40|$|A {{frequency}} ratio RatioXH associated with two carrier frequencies in ppm is introduced for achieving auto-offsetting and -referencing (AOR) in biomolecular NMR. Once {{the center of}} 1 H is referenced, all the offsets in other dimensions are automatically determined and the centers of the spectral widths provide accurate indirect references. Since the scale in ppm is independent of the magnetic field strength, the AOR does not require manually updating carrier frequencies from time to time, making the multidimensional NMR experiments greatly simplified and reliable. It is extremely valuable when molecules need to be run {{a large number of}} experiments at different times and the data (chemical shifts, for example) need to be compared with each other. In AOR, the error arising from improper referencing of 1 H is handed down in the same amount to the other nuclei being referenced. This error-inheritance provides a measure of accuracy in <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing.</b> The temperature dependence of the {{frequency ratio}} of DSS is derived with the first-order approximation and it can be used for temperature dependent AOR. For nuclei other than 13 C, certain frequency ratios regarding TMS need to be derived (rather than measured) based on the recommended frequency ratios of DSS, thus avoiding conflicts and unifying the two standards...|$|E

40|$|Current {{popularity}} {{and lack of}} successful innovation {{in the field of}} Graphical User Interface(GUI) builders leads {{to the question of how}} we can pave the way for a second generation of (GUI) builders. This question requires a new approach on GUI builder innovation by changing event handling practices to integrate a Domain Specific Language (DSL). We propose a DSL based on R 2 ML that can be pre-compiled to. NET framework source code. The adoption of a DSL provides a starting point but offers similar problems with large numbers of rules like other previous unsuccessful innovations. We attempt to mitigate this concern with the adoption of an event correlation architecture which enables the realization of complex events. Complex events allow for the combining of primitive events to gain a higher level event which we propose is easier to relate to user requirements. We further reduce the number of rules developers require by introducing querying techniques to provide <b>indirect</b> <b>referencing,</b> rather than using traditional URI approaches which are more tightly coupled. Comparison of the lines of code our solution requires, against a comparison not using our solution, demonstrates a decrease in effort for developers.

40|$|Zero-Copy Objects System {{software}} enables {{application data}} to be encapsulated in layers of communication protocol without being copied. <b>Indirect</b> <b>referencing</b> enables application source data, either in memory or in a file, to be encapsulated in place within an unlimited number of protocol headers and/or trailers. Zero-copy objects (ZCOs) are abstract data access representations designed to minimize I/O (input/output) in the encapsulation of application source data within one or more layers of communication protocol structure. They are constructed within the heap space of a Simple Data Recorder (SDR) data store to which all participating layers of the stack must have access. Each ZCO contains general information enabling access to the core source data object (an item of application data), together with (a) a linked list of zero or more specific extents that reference portions of this source data object, and (b) linked lists of protocol header and trailer capsules. The concatenation of the headers (in ascending stack sequence), the source data object extents, and the trailers (in descending stack sequence) constitute the transmitted data object constructed from the ZCO. This scheme enables a source data object to be encapsulated in a succession of protocol layers without ever having to be copied from a buffer at one layer of the protocol stack to an encapsulating buffer at a lower layer of the stack. For large source data objects, the savings in copy time and reduction in memory consumption may be considerable...|$|E
