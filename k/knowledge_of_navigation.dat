60|$|It {{was with}} {{feelings}} of awe, not unmingled with fear, that I now seated myself on the cabin skylight and gazed upon the rigid features of my late comrade, while my mind wandered over his past history and contemplated with anxiety my present position. Alone {{in the midst of}} the wide Pacific, having a most imperfect <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation,</b> and in a schooner requiring at least eight men as her proper crew! But I will not tax the reader's patience with a minute detail of my feelings and doings during the first few days that followed the death of my companion.

60|$|The {{acquisition}} of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> has a strange effect {{on the minds of}} men. The average navigator speaks of navigation with deep respect. To the layman navigation is a deed and awful mystery, which feeling has been generated in him by the deep and awful respect for navigation that the layman has seen displayed by navigators. I have known frank, ingenuous, and modest young men, open as the day, to learn navigation and at once betray secretiveness, reserve, and self-importance as if they had achieved some tremendous intellectual attainment. The average navigator impresses the layman as a priest of some holy rite. With bated breath, the amateur yachtsman navigator invites one in to look at his chronometer. And so it was that our friends suffered such apprehension at our sailing without a navigator.|$|E

60|$|I was {{too young}} in the trade to keep any journal of this voyage, though my master, who was, for a Portuguese, a pretty good artist, {{prompted}} me to it; but my not understanding the language was one hindrance; at least it served me for an excuse. However, after some time, I began to look into his charts and books; and, as I could write a tolerable hand, understood some Latin, and began {{to have a little}} smattering of the Portuguese tongue, so I began to get a superficial <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation,</b> but not such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me through a life of adventure, as mine was to be. In short, I learned several material things in this voyage among the Portuguese; I learned particularly to be an arrant thief and a bad sailor; and I think I may say they are the best masters for teaching both these of any nation in the world.|$|E
60|$|The Crusaders {{were not}} {{sufficiently}} advanced in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> {{to attempt to}} enter Palestine by sea, and they therefore traversed Germany, Hungary, and the Greek Empire, trusting to the Emperor Alexis Comnenus {{to give them the}} means of crossing the Hellespont. Alexis was in great dread of his warlike guests; the schism between the Greek and Roman Churches caused continual heart-burnings; {{and at the same time}} he considered, very naturally, that all the lands in the East at present occupied by the Mahometans were his right. He would not, therefore, ferry over the Crusaders to Asia till they had sworn allegiance to him for all that they might conquer, and it was a long time before Godfrey would comply. At last, however, on condition that the Greeks would furnish them with guides and reinforcements, they took the oaths; but as Alexis did not fulfil his part of the engagement, they did not consider themselves bound to him.|$|E
60|$|The James {{was still}} lying in Philadelphia, {{undergoing}} repairs, {{and waiting for}} freight; but being now ready for sea, I shipped in her again, on a voyage to St. Thomas, with a cargo of flour. When we sailed, I left near a hundred dollars behind me, besides carrying some money to sea; the good effects of good company. At St. Thomas we discharged, and took in ballast for Turk's Island, where we got a cargo of salt, returning with it to Philadelphia. My conduct had been such on board this schooner, that her commander, who was her owner, and very old, having determined to knock off going to sea, tried to persuade me to stick by the craft, promising to make me her captain {{as soon as he}} could carry her down east, where she belonged. I now think I made a great mistake in not accepting this offer, though I was honestly diffident about my <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation.</b> I never had a clear understanding of the lunars, though I worked hard to master them. It is true, chronometers were coming into general use, in large vessels, and I could work the time; but a chronometer was a thing never heard of on board the James. Attachment to the larger towns, and a dislike for little voyages, had as much influence on me as anything else. I declined the offer; the only direct one ever made me to command any sort of craft, and remained what I am. I had a little contempt, too, for vessels of such a rig and outfit, which probably had its influence. I liked rich owners.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{a method}} that models user {{navigation}} on the web, {{as opposed to a}} single website, is presented, aiming to assist the user by recommending pages.

The experimental results showed that the method does indeed facilitate the modeling <b>of</b> web <b>navigation,</b> which was not possible with the existing web usage mining methods. However, a content-based recommendation model is shown to still outperform the proposed method, which suggests that the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>navigation</b> sequence does not contribute to the recommendation process.
