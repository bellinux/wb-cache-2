2500|$|Glow-transfer {{counting}} tubes, {{similar in}} essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge {{on one of}} a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of [...] "guide" [...] cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was <b>Dekatron.</b> Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named Selectron tubes.|$|E

50|$|Counter/Selector (separate-cathode) <b>dekatrons</b> {{have each}} cathode wired {{to its own}} pin; {{therefore}} their bases have at least 13 pins. Selectors allow for monitoring the status of each cathode or to divide-by-n with the proper reset circuitry. This kind of versatility made such <b>dekatrons</b> useful for numerical division in early calculators.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dekatron</b> {{was useful}} for computing, calculating and {{frequency-dividing}} purposes because one complete {{revolution of the}} neon dot in a <b>dekatron</b> means 10 pulses on the guide electrode(s), and a signal {{can be derived from}} one of the ten cathodes in a <b>dekatron</b> to send a pulse, possibly for another counting stage. Dekatrons usually have a maximum input frequency in the high kilohertz (kHz) range - 100 kHz is fast, 1 MHz is around the maximum possible. These frequencies are obtained in hydrogen-filled fast dekatrons. Dekatrons filled with inert gas are inherently more stable and have a longer life, but their counting frequency is limited to 10 kHz (1-2 kHz is more common).|$|E

50|$|Edmund ("Ted") Harry Cooke-Yarborough (25 December 1918 - 10 January 2013) was {{the lead}} {{designer}} of the Harwell <b>Dekatron,</b> one of the world's early electronic computers and also a pioneer of radar.|$|E
50|$|The VU-meter was {{originally}} developed in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC. In the 1970s-80s, neon-filled, planar dual display <b>dekatrons</b> {{with up to}} 201 segments per stereo channel were popular among broadcasters as fast bar graph VU meters.|$|R
2500|$|The world's first all-electronic desktop {{calculator}} was the British Bell Punch ANITA, {{released in}} 1961. It used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and <b>Dekatrons</b> in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [...] "Nixie" [...] tubes for its display. The ANITA sold well {{since it was}} the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick. The tube technology was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a [...] CRT, and introduced reverse Polish notation (RPN).|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen {{is used in}} tubes {{used for}} very fast switching, e.g. some thyratrons, <b>dekatrons,</b> and krytrons, where very steep edges are required. The {{build-up}} and recovery times of hydrogen are much shorter than in other gases. Hydrogen thyratrons are usually hot-cathode. Hydrogen (and deuterium) {{can be stored in}} the tube {{in the form of a}} metal hydride, heated with an auxiliary filament; hydrogen by heating such storage element can be used to replenish cleaned-up gas, and even to adjust the pressure as needed for a thyratron operation at a given voltage.|$|R

50|$|Later, {{with the}} {{development}} of electronic indicators, which started with the introduction of the <b>Dekatron</b> readout tube in the 1950s, and culminating in the modern digital indicator, totalised readings came to be directly indicated in decimal notation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>dekatron</b> {{fell out}} of {{practical}} use when transistor-based counters became reliable and affordable. Today, dekatrons are used by electronic hobbyists in simple [...] "spinners" [...] that run off the mains frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz) or as a numeric indicator for homemade clocks.|$|E
5000|$|The world's first all-electronic desktop {{calculator}} was the British Bell Punch ANITA, {{released in}} 1961. It used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and <b>Dekatrons</b> in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [...] "Nixie" [...] tubes for its display. The ANITA sold well {{since it was}} the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

50|$|Since {{at least}} the 1940s, argon, neon, and phosphored glow {{thyratron}} latching indicators (which would light up upon an impulse on their starter electrode and extinguish only after their anode voltage was cut) were available for example as self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays, or, combined in a 4x4, four-color phosphored-thyratron matrix, as a stackable 625-color RGBA pixel for large video graphics arrays.Multiple-cathode and/or anode glow thyratrons called <b>Dekatrons</b> could count forwards and backwards while their count state was visible as a glow {{on one of the}} numbered cathodes. These were used as self-displaying divide-by-n counter/timer/prescalers in counting instruments, or as adder/subtracters in calculators.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1961, the world's first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting) was announced. This machine used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode {{tubes and}} <b>Dekatrons</b> in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [...] "Nixie" [...] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for {{continental}} Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain {{and the rest}} of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical comptometers of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly [...] due to its large tube system. Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names [...] "Plus" [...] and [...] "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.|$|R
50|$|Low-power thyratrons (relay {{tubes and}} trigger tubes) were {{manufactured}} for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in <b>Dekatron</b> calculators, for voltage threshold detectors in RC timers, etc. Glow thyratrons were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even phosphorized {{and used as}} self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronics}} {{division of}} the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, UK built the Harwell <b>Dekatron</b> Computer in 1951, which was an automatic calculator where the decimal arithmetic and memory were electronic, although other functions were performed by relays. By 1953, {{it was evident that}} this did not meet AERE's computing needs, and AERE director Sir John Cockcroft encouraged them to design and build a computer using transistors throughout.|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, a <b>Dekatron</b> (or Decatron, or generically {{three-phase}} gas counting tube or glow-transfer counting tube or {{cold cathode}} tube) is a gas-filled decade counting tube. Dekatrons {{were used in}} computers, calculators and other counting-related products during the 1950s and 1960s. [...] "Dekatron," [...] now a generic trademark, was the brand name used by the British Ericsson Telephones Limited (ETL), of Beeston, Nottingham (not {{to be confused with}} the Swedish TelefonAB Ericsson of Stockholm).|$|E
5000|$|... in 1957, Cooke-Yarborough was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Electronics Division at AERE Harwell, and published [...] "An Introduction to Transistor Circuits".In 1980, Cooke-Yarborough was elected Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (later to become the Royal Academy of Engineering) and {{was appointed}} Chief Research Scientist at AERE until he retired in 1982.On 20 November 2012, Cooke-Yarborough attended the reboot of the Harwell <b>Dekatron</b> Computer at the National Museum of Computing, the last time that he appeared in public.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, Cooke-Yarborough joined UK Atomic Energy {{programme}} to work {{on nuclear}} instrumentation. Soon after his transfer to AERE Harwell in 1948, he supervised {{the production of the}} Harwell <b>Dekatron</b> Computer, working with fellow designers Dick Barnes and Gurney Thomas. All three visited the EDSAC computer in Cambridge during the design stage. In 1951, Cooke-Yarborough attended the first Bell Labs symposium on the transistor. Afterwards he developed the Harwell CADET computer, {{which was one of the}} first digital computers to use transistors.|$|E
5000|$|Internal designs vary by {{the model}} and manufacturer, but {{generally}} a <b>dekatron</b> has ten cathodes {{and one or two}} guide electrodes plus a common anode. The cathodes are arranged in a circle with a guide electrode (or two) between each cathode. When the guide electrode(s) is pulsed properly, the neon gas will activate near the guide pins then [...] "jump" [...] to the next cathode. Pulsing the guide electrodes (negative going pulses) repeatedly will cause the neon dot to move from cathode to cathode.|$|E
50|$|Bletchley Park {{in north}} Buckinghamshire was the {{principal}} Allied centre for codebreaking. The Colossus computer, arguably the world's first, began working on Lorentz codes on 5 February 1944, with Colossus 2 working from June 1944. The site was chosen, among other reasons, because {{it is at the}} junction of the Varsity Line (between Oxford and Cambridge) and the West Coast Main Line. The Harwell computer (<b>Dekatron),</b> now at the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley, was built in 1949 and {{is believed to be the}} oldest working digital computer in the world.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen dekatrons require high {{voltages}} {{ranging from}} 400 to 600 volts on the anode for proper operation; dekatrons with inert gas usually require ~350 volts. When a <b>dekatron</b> is first powered up, a glowing dot appears at a random cathode; the tube must then be {{reset to zero}} state, by driving a negative pulse into the designated starting cathode. The color of the dot depends {{on the type of}} gas that is in the tube. Neon-filled tubes display a red-orange dot; argon-filled tubes display a purple dot (and are much dimmer than neon).|$|E
50|$|The Harwell {{computer}}, later {{known as}} the Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell (WITCH), or the Harwell <b>Dekatron</b> Computer, is an early British relay-based computer of the 1950s. From 2009 to 2012, it was restored at the National Museum of Computing. In 2013, {{for the second time}} the Guinness Book of World Records recognised it as the world's oldest working digital computer, following its restoration, it previously held the title for several years until it was decommissioned in 1973. The museum uses the computer's visual, dekatron-based memory to teach schoolchildren about computers.|$|E
5000|$|An {{instrument}} which totalises {{the events}} detected over a time period {{is known as}} a scaler. This colloquial name stems from the early days of automatic counting, when a scaling circuit was required to divide down a high count rate to a speed which mechanical counters could register. This technique was developed by C E Wynn-Williams at The Cavendish Laboratory and first published in 1932. The original counters used the [...] "Eccles-Jordan divider" [...] circuit, today known as a flip flop. This was before the era of electronic indicators, which started with the introduction of the <b>Dekatron</b> tube in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Many {{types of}} cold-cathode {{switching}} tube were developed, including {{various types of}} thyratron, the krytron, cold cathode displays (Nixie tube) and others. Voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current, and were used to stabilize power supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A <b>Dekatron</b> is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting. Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by {{the position of the}} glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of integrated circuit counter devices.|$|E
5000|$|The museum also {{includes}} the world's oldest working digital computer (the Harwell <b>Dekatron</b> / WITCH), machines from the 1960s such as the Marconi Transistorised Automatic Computer (T.A.C.), Elliott 803 and 905, an ICL 2966 mainframe from the 1980s, {{a wide range of}} analogue computers, a hands-on retrocomputing gallery, and several restoration projects such as the PDP-8 and the PDP-11-based air traffic control system from London Terminal Control Centre at West Drayton near London. Further exhibits include mechanical and electronic calculators, a history of slide rules, a pair of Cray super computers, and a personal computing gallery with ten hands-on machines. Visitors can also see a re-build of the Cambridge University EDSAC computer that is underway (still in progress as of February 2017.) ...|$|E
