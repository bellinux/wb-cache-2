Besides that, the researcher also wants to study how total trade in Malaysia affected economic growth. This study also wants to discover the relationship between <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> and <b>total</b> trade on economic growth in Malaysia. Data are analyzed by using Pearson correlation, Durbin-Watson, mean square, F value, R Square and coefficient of variables as well as gap analysis through SPSS Program. <b>External</b> <b>debt</b> and <b>total</b> trade are known as the major contributors to the economy of a nation. This study examines the role of these two variables in the economic growth in Malaysia by using a Malaysia time series data covering a period of 30 years (19752005).

40|$|The program {{made good}} {{progress}} toward creating {{the conditions for}} faster sustained growth over the medium term. The economic policies aim to preserve the program's macroeconomic framework. Fiscal policy is expected to stay on a sustainable path. The central bank {{has been successful in}} achieving its inflation target. The proposed target for net international reserves will maintain an adequate reserve cushion. The prospects for sustained growth over the medium term remain favorable, provided the government maintains a strong fiscal policy and advance structural reforms.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{debt management}} from a solvency point of view. The approach is particularly useful since we can measure {{the effect of}} debt management policies, such as debt composition and maturity, in probabilities of insolvency. Thus, by introducing debt management with new financial solvency criteria we can {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} that management under the Mexican experience. In particular we evaluate the effect of having different debt composition and the impact of longer maturities in such probabilities. We observe that the probability of reaching a threshold that is unsustainable has decreased from the 1980 s and during the 1990 s and the 2000 s. In fact, the simulations suggest that the policy reaction function of the primary surplus to public debt is highly responsive, given the historical effort of debt reduction {{at the end of the}} 1980 s. Then, we run a simulation over the sub sample period 1996 - 2005, in which we incorporate explicitly the <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> reduction policy with different rates of reduction of the proportion of <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> to <b>total</b> ratio. We find that on average, reducing the proportion of <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> to <b>total</b> in 3 percent every period reduces the probability of a crisis in 0. 03. Finally, we incorporate an index of domestic maturity in the estimated model and introduce an explicit policy of maturity increases. If the average maturity of the domestic debt increases from zero to two percent every quarter, on average the probability of reaching the specified threshold in 0. 02. Similarly, increasing the rate of the term structure of debt from zero to four percent reduces the probability in 0. 037, increasing it at 6 percent per quarter decreases the probability i...|$|R

Real GDP growth averaged 2 percent during 2000 / 01 – 2004 / 05, compared with the 1990 s when growth in agricultural productivity and significant trade liberalization contributed to average real GDP growth of 5 percent. Inflation has remained in the low single digits, although it rose to 7 Â¾ percent in mid-October 2005. The overall and domestically financed deficits remained limited in 2004 / 05.

40|$|Guatemala, {{with over}} 10 million inhabitants, {{has the largest}} {{population}} and gross domestic product (GDP) in Central America. It also has the most inequitable distribution of income, wealth, and land ownership in the region. It has the lowest spending on education, health care, and other services. Additionally, it has the lowest tax revenue, less than 8 % {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 1995; in comparison, the average tax rate for Central America is 17 % and for Latin America 23 %. During the 1960 s and 70 s Guatemala experienced an inflation rate below 10 % and growth that averaged 6 % a year; however, wealth and income remained the most highly skewed in the region, demonstrating that economic growth by itself does not alleviate poverty in a highly unequal society. Between 1980 and 1985 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell 20 %, macroeconomic instability increased, and the country experienced a fiscal and balance of payments crisis combined with major <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> arrears. By 1990 annual inflation had grown to the extreme level of, for Guatemala, 60 %. In 1991 Guatemala attempted a comprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment program, cleared its World Bank arrears and, in 1993, reached a Paris Club agreement to reschedule $ 540 million of foreign debt arrears. By 1994 inflation had again been reduced to almost 10 %. In 1995 Guatemala had <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> <b>totaling</b> $ 2. 95 billion, or 23 % of GDP. The IDB held approximately 21 % of Guatemala's <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> while the World Bank held approximately 7 %. <b>External</b> <b>debt</b> is expected to rise significantly during the reconstruction process due to extensive World Bank and IDB loans. Guatemala signed a global peace accord on December 29, 1996, ending 36 years of internal war and conflict. The international financial community met in a Consultative Group meeting hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank in Brussels in January 1997 and pledged $ 1. 9 billion in loans and donations to Guatemala for the implementation of the peace accords.
