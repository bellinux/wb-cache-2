40|$|While most general {{circulation}} models assume spectrally independent surface emissivity and nonscattering clouds in their longwave radiation treatment, spectral {{variation of the}} index of refraction of ice indicates that in the far IR, snow surface emissivity can vary considerably and ice clouds can cause nonnegligible scattering. These effects are more important for high‐elevation polar continents where the dry and cold atmosphere is not opaque in the far IR. We carry out sensitivity studies to show that in a winter month over the Antarctic Plateau including snow surface spectral emissivity and ice <b>cloud</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>in</b> radiative transfer calculation reduces net upward far‐IR flux at both top of atmosphere and surface. The magnitudes of such reductions in monthly mean all‐sky far‐IR flux range from 0. 72 to 1. 47 Wm − 2, with comparable contributions from the <b>cloud</b> <b>scattering</b> and the surface spectral emissivity. The reduction is also sensitive to sizes of both snow grains and cloud particles. Key Points Ice cloud and snow surface radiative properties vary considerably in the far IR Snow surface emissivity and <b>cloud</b> <b>scattering</b> affect far IR comparably Even for far‐IR radiation alone, the impact is nonnegligibl...|$|R
40|$|Although active sensors {{can provide}} cloud {{profiles}} at good vertical resolution, clouds are often coupled with dynamics to form fast and organized structures. Lack {{of understanding of}} these organized systems leads to great challenge for numerical models. The deficiency is partly reflected, for example, in poorly modeled intraseasonal variations (e. g., MJD). Remote sensing clouds {{in the middle and}} upper troposphere has been challenging from space. Vis/IR sensors are sensitive to the topmost cloud layers whereas low-frequency MW techniques are sensitivity to liquid and precipitation at the bottom of cloud layers. The middle-level clouds, mostly in the ice phase, require a sensor that has moderate penetration and sensitivity to <b>cloud</b> <b>scattering,</b> <b>in</b> order to measure cloud water content. Sensors at submm wavelengths provide promising sensitivity and coverage with the spatial resolution needed to measure cloud water content floating in the upper air. In addition, submm-wave sensors are able to provide better measurements of upper-tropospheric humidity than traditional microwave instruments...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from {{a case study}} in which coincident 35 and 94 GHz radars located at Chilbolton, England, were used to measure crystal size in cirrus. In the presence of larger crystals the 94 GHz radar scatters sufficiently beyond the Rayleigh regime that the difference in reflectivity factor measured by the two can be directly related to size. This enables more accurate estimation of ice water content than would be possible using a single radar. The small crystals {{at the top of the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the Rayleigh regime at both wavelengths, which provides a valuable method of calibration, but also means that sizing is not possible in this part of the cloud. Ice water content and median volume diameter were derived and compared with the analyses of the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model. The smallest measurable median volume diameter in this case study was around 200 m, although it is believed that with both radars sensitive down to 35 dBZ, it should be possible to measure median diameters of 100 m. Scattering calculations have been carried out to determine the sensitivity of these measurements to crystal density, crystal aspect ratio and the shape of the size distribution. Density is found to be the most significant source of uncertainty, possibly introducing errors of 20 % into retrieved diameter. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the importance in clouds {{of these two}} mechanisms compared to a third scattering mechanism: coherent particle scattering, which is caused by spatial variations in the liquid water content of the clouds.
