60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} murdered somewhere down a back street, and if I should miss him very much.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had fancied she {{experienced}} any difficulty in standing up before that innocently good-humored face, but I {{could not resist}} saying:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so," [...] said Sidney absently. I {{could see}} he wasn't {{thinking}} of me at all. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were thinking of Mrs. Rennie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> the same. Surely it is impossible! Only a {{schoolmaster}} still! Do {{you know}} his Christian name--is it Richard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Mike Kenny, the postman, <b>I</b> think. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{has brought}} a letter from sister May. Mother expects one, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, {{intent upon}} her roll: [...] "How funny <b>he</b> is! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did hear {{anything}} but our scolding voices? Where were we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's reasonable,' I answered: for I am a {{political}} economist. 'The benefit should be mutual.' But <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to}} propose at sight to me.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} {{forcibly}} that Wright {{did all the}} calling. He hurried, too, tried to keep in the lead. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew his voice would be recognized by the hiding man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{told that}} Commodore Barney keeps his men jumpin' so lively at fightin' that they don't {{have time for}} anythin' else," [...] the lad said slowly, as if {{speaking}} to himself, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> counted that the commodore could raise the price of oysters.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{did it for}} a joke, {{a double}} joke on Reddy and myself," [...] Jimmy went on, {{scratching}} his head thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Mr. Sewell, as you {{are quite}} aware, plays it {{exceptionally}} well. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> realizes that the major is not fond of losing." ...|$|R
60|$|Will Clerk {{says he has}} {{a theory}} on the {{vitrified}} forts. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> and <b>I</b> agree. I think accidental conflagration is the cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{caught up}} with me on the road home, and grinned as cheerfully as usual. But his grin could never deceive me again. I had seen the REAL Jonas. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could ever see the REAL PHIL--whom NOBODY, not even you, Anne, has ever seen yet.|$|E
60|$|Hearing a soft footfall, I {{glanced over}} my shoulder, {{to see the}} Mexican that I had noticed at the station. He was coming from across the street. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{watching}} me. He might be. My heart began to beat violently. Turning once again, I discovered that the fellow could not {{be seen in the}} pitchy blackness. Then I broke into a run.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} {{consciously}} practising on the sensibilities of this gentle creature. If he had I {{believed he had}} gained his point. But his position had in fact become to my sense so precarious that I hardly ventured to be glad. [...] "His better self just now seems again to be taking shape," [...] I said. [...] "It will {{have been a good}} deed on your part if you help to restore him to all he ought to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what the}} trouble is! That rascal knocked this fellow {{down and then}} hurried on, Sam! Poor fellow! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is much hurt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The old man's mighty fly this evenin'. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{really has}} trailed that float to a standstill. I'd sooner think he's stringin' us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Brown makes {{at such an}} hour of night! [...] He's celebrating {{something}} strange. [...] <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> {{sold his}} farm, [...] Or been made Master of the Grange." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} applause, chiefly from the Count's suite; Checco paused {{as if he had}} {{come to the end of}} his preface, and were {{gathering}} himself up for the real matter of his speech. There was deadly silence in the hall, all eyes were fixed on him, and all minds were asking themselves, 'What will he say?' Girolamo was leaning forward, resting his chin on his hand, looking anxious. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> regretted that he had called the meeting.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{reconcile}} these books {{with the man}} from what I had seen of him, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could possibly read them. But when I came to make the bed I found, between the blankets, dropped apparently as he had sunk off to sleep, a complete Browning, the Cambridge Edition. It was open at “In a Balcony,” and I noticed, here and there, passages underlined in pencil. Further, letting drop the volume during a lurch of the ship, {{a sheet of paper}} fell out. It was scrawled over with geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had left}} me {{to return to his}} fierce pack. A feeling of {{loneliness}} overwhelmed me. With a sigh I turned to the work of dragging the canoe down to the sea. As I entered the jungle where the dugout lay a hare darted from beneath the boat's side, and a well-aimed cast of my javelin brought it down. I was hungry--I had not realized it before--so I sat upon the edge of the canoe and devoured my repast. The last remnants gone, I again busied myself with preparations for my expedition to the island.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Peter, {{speaking}} out loud without thinking, [...] "where he builds his nest. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> builds {{it on the}} ground, the way Creeper does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, <b>he's</b> gone.... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{really was}} the old Texas King Fisher. No one would ever believe it.... But <b>if</b> <b>he</b> killed the Jorths, I'll shore believe him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, the {{excellent}} Monk! He {{is the family}} hero. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> enjoys it more than you? Did he really never let you guess how much he was hurt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{stared at}} him, {{but as he}} chose {{to believe that a}} very unusual hailstorm was a visitation from heaven I did not think it worth while arguing the point. Only <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really did believe this. Then I remembered that such an event was said to have afflicted the old Egyptians in the hour of their pride because they would not [...] "let the people go." [...] Well, these blackguardedly Black Kendah were {{certainly}} worse than the Egyptians can ever have been; also they would not let us go. It was not wonderful therefore that Marût should be the victim of phantasies on the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how happy}} and gay I was {{in those first}} few days! There was not a thought of the past, not an {{ambition}} or desire of any sort to bother me. Just to live seemed pleasure enough. I enjoyed eating and sleeping; I loved to talk and laugh; I {{was glad to have}} work to occupy me--and that was all! Then things began to happen that puzzled me. The man Hopkins declared he could not trust me because I had once been a thief, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could speak truly. I resented the thought that I may once have been a thief, although I wouldn't mind stealing, even now, if I wanted anything and could take it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} Mr. Mellaire's gaze, {{and saw the}} burnt-out, aged little Scotchman squatted on a spare spar and sucking a pipe. One arm was in a sling and {{his head}} was bandaged. Beside him squatted Mulligan Jacobs. They were a pair. Both were blue-eyed, and both were malevolent-eyed. And they were equally emaciated. It {{was easy to see}} that they had discovered early in the voyage their kinship of bitterness. Andy Fay, I knew, was sixty-three years old, although he looked a hundred; and Mulligan Jacobs, who was only about fifty, made up for the difference by the furnace-heat of hatred that burned in his face and eyes. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> sat beside the injured bitter one in some sense of sympathy, or if he were there in order to gloat.|$|E
6000|$|... "The plot thickens, eh?" [...] he said. [...] "What is Mr. Scobell {{doing in}} New York, <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{has not come}} {{to keep an eye}} on his interests?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha!" [...] cried Richard. [...] "I {{wonder how}} <b>he</b> likes it. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> remembers holding {{me up to}} the window, and vowing that he meant me only good!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Two things {{particularly}} {{pressed into}} their minds. One was {{the thought of}} their children, and I do not care to tell how often in the day now they calculated the time in England, and tried to guess to a half mile or so where those young people might be and what they might be doing. [...] "The shops are bright for Christmas now," [...] said Marjorie. [...] "This year Dick was to have had his first fireworks. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> burnt his dear little funny stumps of fingers. I hope not." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the sun shone warm, and the canyon was delightful. I roamed around, sat on sunny stones, and lay {{in the shade of}} pines. Deer browsed in the glades. When they winded or saw me they would stand erect, shoot up their long cars, and then leisurely lope away. Coyotes trotted out of {{thickets}} and watched me suspiciously. I could have shot several, but deemed it wise to be saving of my ammunition. Once I heard a low drumming. I could not imagine what made it. Then a big blue grouse strutted out of a patch of bushes. He spread his wings and tail and neck feathers, after the fashion of a turkey-gobbler. It was a flap or shake of his wings that produced the drumming. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> intended, by his actions, to frighten me away from his mate's nest. So I went toward him, and got very close before he flew. I caught sight of his mate in the bushes, and, as I had supposed, she was on a nest. Though wanting to see her eggs or young ones, I resisted the temptation, for I was afraid if I went nearer she might abandon her nest, as some mother birds do.|$|E
60|$|I {{came out}} on the lake-front, at last, and then I knew where I was. I was walking along before the {{glittering}} jewelry shops when I saw a curious performance. A lady passed by, and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him; he made no offer {{to step out of the}} way; he did not apologize; he did not even notice her. She had to stop still and let him lounge by. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had done that piece of brutality purposely. He strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table; two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water. I waited; presently a youth came by, and this fellow got up and served him the same trick. Still, it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately. To satisfy my curiosity I went around the block, and, sure enough, as I approached, at a good round speed, he got up and lounged lazily across my path, fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight. This proved that his previous performances had not been accidental, but intentional.|$|E
60|$|At Liverpool, at the dock, {{when we had}} touched, twenty {{people came}} on board and I had already made out Mr. Porterfield at a distance. He was {{looking up at the}} side of the great vessel with {{disappointment}} written (to my eyes) in his face--disappointment at not seeing the woman he loved lean over it and wave her handkerchief to him. Every one was looking at him, every one but she (his identity flew about in a moment) and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not observe it. He used to be lean, he had grown almost fat. The interval between us diminished--he was on the plank and then on the deck with the jostling officers of the customs--all too soon for my equanimity. I met him instantly however, laid my hand on him and drew him away, though I perceived that he had no impression of having seen me before. It was not till afterwards that I thought this a little stupid of him. I drew him far away (I was conscious of Mrs. Peck and Mrs. Gotch looking at us as we passed) into the empty, stale smoking-room; he remained speechless, and that struck me as like him. I had to speak first, he could not even relieve me by saying 'Is anything the matter?' I told him first that she was ill. It was an odious moment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a saintly old man Keggs looks,' said Elsa. 'Don't {{you think}} so? <b>He</b> looks as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had never even}} thought of doing {{anything}} <b>he</b> shouldn't. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever has?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was just}} to show he was run after. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thinks we are running after him? Momma, I am tired of him! I wish he wouldn't speak to me any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Singular," [...] said Uncle John, [...] "that Patsy's friend {{turns out}} to be a mystery, even in his own home. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is a leader of the Mafia, or just a common brigand?" ...|$|R
