Our present understanding of the coupled transport of charge, spin and heat relies on the two-channel model for spin-up and spin-down electrons having equal temperatures. Here we report the observation of different (effective) temperatures for the spin-up and spin-down electrons in a nanopillar spin valve subject to a heat current.

Process related temperature gradients and thermal inhomogeneities cause residual stresses, and distortions and influence the microstructure. Variations in wall thickness can cause <b>heat</b> <b>accumulations.</b> These occur predominantly in filigree part areas and can be detected by utilizing off-axis thermographic monitoring during the manufacturing process.

By discussing and comparing experimental data with simulation results in terms of temperature distributions both the potential of numerical approaches and the complexity of determining suitable computation time efficient process models are demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} first thermal model and {{detailed}} analysis of the heating of an electromagnetic (EM) skinequivalent phantom with a finite thickness at 60 GHz. The 1 -D heat transfer equation is solved analytically for homogeneous phantoms with finite thicknesses. The temperature rise dynamics and heating distribution within the phantom are calculated for several phantom thicknesses (5, 10, and 15 mm) using measured thermal properties of the phantom. Analytical results are confirmed by numerical analysis based on EM-thermal cosimulations. Furthermore, the numerical model is validated by measurements using an experimental setup based on the high-resolution infrared thermometry. The impact of uncertainty of EM and the thermal parameters of the numerical model upon heat deposition is also studied. Our results reveal that, for short exposure durations (i. e., less than 1 min), the surface temperature is well described by the semi-infinite and finite-thickness phantom models, whereas, for longer exposures (more than 1 min), finite-thickness models must be used to properly account for <b>heating</b> <b>accumulation</b> close to the phantom boundaries.

Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself may also result in variations in the focality, shape, and depth of cortical penetration of the magnetic field. Differences in the coil substance as well as the electronic operation of the power supply to the coil may also result in variations in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting magnetic pulse (e.g., width or duration of the magnetic field pulse). All of these features should be considered when comparing results obtained from different studies, with respect to both safety and efficacy.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300-10,000 V peak-to-peak. [...] Higher precision can be achieved with pulsed waveforms. Using bursts of several tens of microseconds in duration the tissue can be cut, while the size of the heat diffusion zone does not exceed the cellular scale. <b>Heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> during repetitive application of bursts can also be avoided if sufficient delay is provided between the bursts, allowing the tissue to cool down. The proportion of ON time to OFF time can be varied to allow control of the heating rate. A related parameter, duty cycle, is defined as the ratio of the ON time to the period (the time of a single ON-OFF cycle). In the terminology of electrical engineering, this process of altering an amplitude of a periodic waveform is called modulation.|$|E

50|$|Other {{significant}} differences exist {{depending on the}} time period of the data and formula used for calculating growing degree-days. First, to be comparable growing degree-day numbers from various sources need {{to come from the}} same time period. Due to both a variable climate and climate change, a comparison of a ten-year period from the 1970s and the 2000s would be inappropriate as the variation and trends over time would make them incomparable. Furthermore, a sufficient time period is suggested to allow the averaging to smooth out some of the variability. The standard time period in use is the climatological normal period of 30 years, however if 30 years of data is not available then at the minimum five years should be used. However a five-year period is not directly comparable to a 30-year period. How data are averaged (i.e., hourly, daily, or monthly) is also very important. While weather stations today can average data to an hour, a minutes or even seconds, historical data used to calculate growing degree-days has been done mostly on daily or monthly averages (the table above was done using monthly climatological normals). Shorter term averaging to minutes, or more commonly hourly, arguably better reflects the true thermal effects on the crops, but will result in growing degree-day values that are lower than both daily and monthly. Monthly averaged data can be very problematic as it can underestimate <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> during the first and last months of the growing season. Therefore, it is paramount that one know the time period that the growing degree-day values are calculated from so as to be comparable.|$|E

All days during the growing season are then added up (all negative values are set to zero), with the sum of the growing degree-days used to determine the region's classification in the original Winkler index as follows:The system was originally developed for and is used officially in California and was based on the general ripening capabilities and wine styles that can be achieved in the climate due to <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> (growing degree-days).
