In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the jungyō (regional tour) department, a less high-profile position.|$|E

25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} may have trouble in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that an organization does not have enough time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over trying to change the culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Neither cross-side network effects nor same-side network {{effects are}} {{sufficient}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> to be a MSP. Examining traditional supermarkets, {{it is clear}} that shoppers prefer higher number of suppliers and bigger variety of goods, while suppliers value higher number of buyers. Nevertheless, a supermarket does not qualify as an MSP because it does not enable direct contact between shoppers and suppliers. On the other hand, such network effects are not required for a firm to be seen as an MSP. One example is the situation in which niche event organizers implement a ticketing service managed by a small on-line ticket provider in their websites. Consumers affiliate with the on-line ticket provider only when they go to the website to buy the ticket. However, cross-side network effects and same-side network effects are common in MSPs.|$|E

25|$|While in an organization, it is {{important}} to focus on traits and functionalities of leaders from within, it is also key to focus on the relational side of leadership. Being relational with leaders/followers allows for relationships to be built. While looking at the two different models (vertical dyad linkage theory and leader–member exchange theory), different perspectives from each side are gained. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> to be democratic, the LMX theory supports the claims of it. The influence of VDL model helped get LMX theory to where it is today. Usually the assumption is leaders can only build close relations with trusted assistants due to lack of time and resources. Leaders developing relations usually results in partnerships with certain followers, but leaders have the responsibility to make relations and offer partnerships to all of the followers (Hackman & Johnson, 2009, pg. 94). Making partnerships with all of the followers will increase the performance of the organization as a whole. Once this relation is built a relation trust is built and more information is able to be revealed to the organization leader.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> to {{be focused}} on a {{democratic}} leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information and come up with creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E
