40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} collective interactions between <b>hamstrings</b> extensibility, anterior knee laxity, and <b>hamstrings</b> and quadriceps muscle activation {{as predictors of}} anterior knee shear forces during single-leg landings in females. Forty-five healthy, recreationally active females participated in a single data collection session during which <b>hamstrings</b> muscle extensibility and anterior knee laxity were measured, followed by measurement of surface electromyography of the quadriceps and <b>hamstrings</b> and estimation of anterior knee shear forces during single-leg landings. Five single-leg drop landings were conducted from a 30 cm platform positioned 30 % of {{the height of the}} participant behind the center of a force plate. Electromyographic data were normalized to maximum volitional isometric contractions at 30 ° of knee flexion, and forces were normalized to body weight. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the ability of <b>hamstrings</b> extensibility, anterior knee laxity, and <b>hamstrings</b> and quadriceps pre- and post-landing activation amplitudes to predict initial, rate, and peak anterior knee shear forces during the landings. The primary findings were that <b>hamstrings</b> pre-landing activation negatively predicted anterior knee shear force at initial ground contact an...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the role of the <b>hamstrings</b> musculature during dynamic loading tasks with different contraction types (concentric vs. eccentric vs. stretch-shortening cycle). It was hypothesized that: (1) the <b>hamstrings</b> musculature would exhibit greater muscle activation in concentric compared to eccentric contractions, and (2) that the <b>hamstrings</b> would exhibit greater muscle activation in the stretch-shortening cycle compared to concentric contractions.|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Hamstrings</b> strains {{are common}} and {{debilitating}} injuries in many sports. Most <b>hamstrings</b> exercises are performed at an inadequately low hip-flexion angle because this angle surpasses 70 ° {{at the end}} of the sprinting leg's swing phase, when most injuries occur. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of various hip-flexion angles on peak torques of knee flexors in isometric, concentric, and eccentric contractions and on the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio. DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. SETTING: Research laboratory. Patients and Other Participants: Ten national-level sprinters (5 men, 5 women; age = 21. 2 ± 3. 6 years, height = 175 ± 6 cm, mass = 63. 8 ± 9. 9 kg). Intervention(s) : For each hip position (0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° of flexion), participants used the right leg to perform (1) 5 seconds of maximal isometric <b>hamstrings</b> contraction at 45 ° of knee flexion, (2) 5 maximal concentric knee flexion-extensions at 60 ° per second, (3) 5 maximal eccentric knee flexion-extensions at 60 ° per second, and (4) 5 maximal eccentric knee flexionextensions at 150 ° per second. Main Outcome Measure(s) : <b>Hamstrings</b> and quadriceps peak torque, hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio, lateral and medial <b>hamstrings</b> root mean square. RESULTS: We found no difference in quadriceps peak torque for any condition across all hip-flexion angles, whereas <b>hamstrings</b> peak torque was lower at 0 ° of hip flexion than at any other angle (P . 05). CONCLUSIONS: Hip-flexion angle influenced <b>hamstrings</b> peak torque in all muscular contraction types; as hip flexion increased, <b>hamstrings</b> peak torque increased. Researchers should investigate further whether an eccentric resistance training program at sprint-specific hip-flexion angles (70 ° to 80 °) could help prevent <b>hamstrings</b> injuries in sprinters. Moreover, hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio assessment should be standardized at 80 ° of hip flexion...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the neuromuscular activation characteristics of the <b>hamstrings</b> during the 'Nordic' <b>hamstrings</b> exercise (NHE) {{and changes in the}} eccentric strength of the knee flexors with NHE training. Initially, the normalised root mean square electromyographic (EMG) activity of the <b>hamstrings</b> of both limbs during various phases (90 - 61 degrees, 60 - 31 degrees and 30 - 0 degrees of knee extension) of the NHE were determined in 18 soccer players. Subsequently participants were randomly allocated to either a training (n = 10) or control group. The isokinetic eccentric peak torques of the dominant and non-dominant limbs were recorded at 60, 120 and 240 degrees/s pre- and post-training. The EMG values of both limbs were comparable (P = 0. 184) and greater EMG activity was recorded at more extended knee positions of the NHE (P = 0. 001). 4 weeks of NHE training significantly improved peak torque by up to 21 % in all assessment conditions. Data indicate the <b>hamstrings</b> of both limbs are engaged identically during the NHE and training results in gains in the eccentric peak torque of the <b>hamstrings</b> of both limbs; these gains may augment the force that the <b>hamstrings</b> can withstand when forcefully stretched, attenuating injury risk...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} electrical stimulation of <b>hamstrings</b> and L 3 / 4 dermatome on the swing phase of gait. Materials and Methods. Five subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) with spasticity were included. Two electrical stimulation methods were investigated, i. e., <b>hamstrings</b> and L 3 / 4 dermatome stimulation. Both interventions were applied during the swing phase of gait. The main outcome measures were step length, maximum hip, and knee flexion during the swing phase of gait. In three subjects changes of spinal inhibition during gait were evaluated using the Hoffman reflex/m (motor) -wave (H/M) ratio at mid swing. Results. The hip flexion decreased 4. 6 degrees (p < 0. 05) when the <b>hamstrings</b> were stimulated during the swing phase, whereas the knee flexion was not changed. The step length did not change significantly. One subject showed a decrease of the H/M ratio to a nonpathologic level during <b>hamstrings</b> stimulation. Conclusion. It was concluded that <b>hamstrings</b> stimulation during the swing phase results in a reduction of the hip flexion in all five SCI subjects. The H/M ratio of the vastus lateralis was normalized using <b>hamstrings</b> stimulation in one of three subjects. Stimulation of the L 3 / 4 dermatome provides no significant changes in gait performance, but in one subject the H/M ratio increased...|$|R
40|$|Many {{clinical}} studies {{have emphasized the}} role of the <b>hamstrings</b> and the iliotibial band on knee mechanics, although few biomechanical studies have investigated it. This study therefore examined two hypotheses: (a) with loading of the <b>hamstrings,</b> the tibia translates posteriorly and rotates externally and the tibial contact pattern shifts anteriorly; furthermore, the changes in tibial kinematics alter patellar kinematics and contact; and (b) loading the iliotibial band alters the kinematics and contact pattern of the tibiofemoral joint similarly to loading the <b>hamstrings,</b> and loading the iliotibial band laterally translates the patella and its contact location. Five cadaveric knee specimens were tested with a specially designed knee-joint testing machine in an open-chain configuration. At various flexion angles, the knees were tested always with a quadriceps force but with and without a <b>hamstrings</b> force and with and without an iliotibial band force. The results support the first hypothesis. Hence, the <b>hamstrings</b> may be important anterior and rotational stabilizers of the tibia, a role {{similar to that of the}} anterior cruciate ligament. The results also support the second hypothesis, although the iliotibial band force had a smaller effect on the tibia than did the <b>hamstrings</b> force. Both forces also changed patellar kinematics and contact, demonstrating that these structures should also be considered during the clinical management of patellar disorder...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) -deficient subjects increase the level of <b>hamstrings</b> activation and this has been interpreted as a means to cope with increased anterior tibial laxity in the knee. This study aimed to establish to what extent co-activation strategies in ACL-deficient subjects are load level and knee angle dependent. Eleven chronic ACL-deficient and 15 control subjects were positioned in a range of postures and asked to exert a feedback controlled vertical ground reaction force (GRF; 30, 60 % and maximum), while horizontal forces were not constrained. Surface electromyography of the leg muscles and GRF were measured. In postures with the knee over and in front of the ankle, ACL-deficient subjects generated, respectively, 2. 4 and 5. 1 % MVC more <b>hamstrings</b> activation than control subjects. Enhanced <b>hamstrings</b> co-activation in ACL-deficient subjects was more apparent in extended than in flexed knee angles. For both ACL-deficient and control subjects, <b>hamstrings</b> co-activation was larger in males than in females. It is concluded that ACL-deficient subjects show a task dependent increase in <b>hamstrings</b> co-activation, but its clinical significance remains to be shown. © Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|R
