40|$|Vibrational-resolved ion and <b>ion-pair</b> <b>yield</b> {{spectra of}} N 2 and CO taken at their 1 s⃗π* {{resonance}} excitations reveal decay-channel-dependent core hole lifetimes. The linewidths of the yield spectra {{tend to be}} shortened {{when the number of}} electrons ejected in the deexcitation process increases, finally becoming narrower than the total ion yield or absorption natural lifetime width of the core-excited states of N 2 and CO, respectively. In contrast to this, the linewidths of the yield spectra for the singly charged molecular ions, N 2 + and CO+, are shown to be broader than their corresponding natural linewidths. This linewidth shortening and broadening observed in the ion yield spectra are explained by the effect of different internuclear distances on the lifetime of an excited molecular state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ionic photofragmentation {{of carbon}} {{monoxide}} following carbon 1 s and oxygen 1 s excitation has been mea-sured quantitatively with tuned synchrotron light and time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Wiley–McLaren appara-tus modified with an additional ion lens for improved quantitative performance. The sensitivity of the apparatus to kinetic energy and angular distribution effects has been characterized for selected lens settings through ion trajectory simulations and experimental measurements. Three distinct modes of the added lens have been identified (focus, defocus, and maximum). The focus mode has the least sensitivity to details of the angular and ion kinetic energy distri-bution and, therefore, is the best mode for measuring quantitative partial ion and <b>ion-pair</b> <b>yields.</b> The defocus mode has the most sensitivity to angular and kinetic energy distributions and, therefore, is the mode that provides the most infor-mation about the kinematics of photofragmentation. Branching ratios for ion and ion-pair production in all positive io...|$|R
