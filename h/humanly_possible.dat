If a maneuver is attempted, the instructor [...] "interpolates the initial control movements" [...] and predicts which maneuver is being performed. The instructor then gives {{advice on how to}} complete the maneuver and offers guidance if a mistake is made. Grant believed that the code is sometimes [...] "too picky", and he stated that it expects players to perform maneuvers more precisely than is <b>humanly</b> <b>possible.</b> The team initially planned to include an online multiplayer component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area—thereby giving players the ability to compete with one another. However, the feature was not implemented into the final game. The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism. Problems with artificially intelligent judges were also a factor in the feature's removal.|$|E

5000|$|Otto {{does not}} build its own trucks, instead {{focusing}} on making hardware kits {{which can be}} installed relatively quickly on trucks at service centers or factories. The goal of the company {{over the next few}} years is for the technology to be used by truck drivers during long-haul drives to allow them to rest during the journey. This in turn would reduce the number of hours it takes for drivers to complete a journey by potentially being able to drive continuously, and overcome the 11-hour legal restriction on manual driving.As of August 2016, Otto has converted five Volvo 780 semis with self-driving technology, and is testing them on interstate highways. They use similar technology to those developed by Google and Nissan, equipping the trucks with radar, cameras, and lidar. The automated technology makes driving more efficient, and would allow a truck driver to sleep while the truck is driving itself. Levandowski has stated: [...] "Our goal is to make trucks drive as <b>humanly</b> as <b>possible,</b> but with the reliability of machines." ...|$|R

What pains me most is the way that, more than a year later, Brydan's indiscretion is still being dragged up again and again. He didn't actually know what {{the meaning of the word}} 'kaffir' was. He actually heard the South African players say it. He thought it was a swear word, so when he said it, he obviously had no idea what he was saying. He was only 18 years old and the other person didn't even hear it and it didn't really affect the match. I was there, sitting close to where Brydan was as <b>humanly</b> as <b>possible</b> apart from being on the court, and you couldn't hear anything. If you had been there you wouldn't have heard anything either so it's not like he was ranting or raving at his opponent, calling him names and being racist, because he's anything but.

500|$|Hobbs' {{technique}} {{was based on}} strong forearms and good foot movement. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that [...] "his footwork was, as near as is <b>humanly</b> <b>possible,</b> perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body." [...] He played every type of shot—he {{did not have a}} [...] "signature" [...] shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that [...] "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them." [...] This was the period in which he became known as [...] "The Master", and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; [...] 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} traffic congestion in San Antonio. We propose a way to understand traffic by building a simulation model that imitates human driver behavior. Our implementation has a heavy focus on environmental features, such as landmarks, lane usage, and driver familiarity with an area.

We propose that adding environmental features that influence decision making will be a closer representation of true human behavior.

40|$|As a {{political}} entity created in 1920 on the south-eastern {{border of the}} Mediterranean basin, {{after the collapse of}} the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon had quickly to find its identity and to erect the structural elements of its personality. At the end of the First World War, Charles Corm worked towards that end and became the symbol of an era. He proposed that Lebanon identify itself not only with Mediterranean civilization but with the foundation of a civilization as <b>humanly</b> wide as <b>possible.</b> Our paper has three areas of focus: 1 – Corm’s promotion of a humanistic dimension to nationalism through “The Lebanese Friendship Circle” and “The Phoenician Magazine”, 2 – presentation of two texts that are considered as foundational for this philosophy: Humanism and the Mediterranean, and Humanism of Lebanon, and 3 – the theme that recurs throughout his poetry, and elsewhere, a theme that illustrates all the humanistic values that he preached.

2500|$|In August 1914, {{he started}} {{suffering}} from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At {{the end of the}} war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health. In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: [...] "No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything <b>humanly</b> <b>possible</b> to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse...Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe". The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an [...] "Aryan soldier-king" [...] and as a [...] "Siegfried" [...] who had embraced the [...] "struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry". Chamberlain went on to call the war [...] "a life-or-death struggle...between two human ideals: the German and the un-German". Accordingly, the Reich must [...] "for the next hundred years or more" [...] strengthen all things German and carry out [...] "the determined extermination of the un-German". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: [...] "I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations-1870 and 1914-and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes." [...] In his 1914 essay, [...] "Whose Fault Is the War?", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain. Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war and the French and Russians were just British puppets. [...] Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited, were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. Röhl wrote the war made the [...] "brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular" [...] of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain [...] "more intense".|$|E
