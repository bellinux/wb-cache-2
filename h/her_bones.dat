5|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} falsely imprisoned and trafficked {{her across the}} country. He married her and {{tortured}} her, breaking several of <b>her</b> <b>bones</b> and burning her body. In order {{to cope with the}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine and almost died. Eventually, she got out of prostitution and, with her mother's support, went through drug rehabilitation, finished high school, and eventually received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed, {{and she had no}} kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered <b>her</b> <b>bones</b> and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1861, Ranavalona died in {{her sleep}} at the Manjakamiadana palace in the Rova of Antananarivo. Twelve {{thousand}} zebu were slaughtered and their meat distributed to the populace in her honor, and the official mourning period lasted nine months. Her body was laid in a coffin made of silver piastres in a tomb at the royal city of Ambohimanga. During her funeral, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined {{for use in the}} ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three historic royal residences in the Nanjakana section of the compound where the event was held. In 1897, French colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen's body and the remains of other Merina sovereigns to the tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo in an attempt to desanctify Ambohimanga. <b>Her</b> <b>bones</b> were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina. Her son, Prince Rakoto, succeeded her as King Radama II.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of <b>her</b> <b>bones</b> and burned her body.|$|E
5|$|The gangsters {{have bought}} a weapon off the Brotherhood {{which can help}} them fight against Inhumans. They open the box {{containing}} the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force takes out the gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her which can help Johnson heal—her recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing <b>her</b> <b>bones.</b> Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts it, but it defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She thinks this should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.|$|E

50|$|The {{patient had}} a small uterus, with an endometrial stripe {{that could not be}} clearly identified. At the age of 15 years, 5 months, <b>her</b> <b>bone</b> age was 11 or 12 years, and at the age of 17 years, 8 months, <b>her</b> <b>bone</b> age was 13.5 years. <b>Her</b> <b>bone</b> mass was lower than {{expected}} for her age, and levels of osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide were both elevated, suggesting an increased rate of bone turnover. She was 162.6 cm tall, and her growth velocity indicated a lack of estrogen-induced growth spurt at puberty. The patient had normal pubic hair development (Tanner stage IV) and severe facial acne, which could both be attributed to testosterone. Her ovarian pathology was attributed to the elevated levels of gonadotropins. In addition to her absence of breast development and areolar enlargement, the patient also appeared to show minimal widening of the hips and a lack of subcutaneous fat deposition, which is in accordance with the established role of estrogen and ERα in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics.|$|R

25|$|Her {{remains were}} found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To {{preserve}} her body during the long summer trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered {{in a mixture of}} ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved <b>her</b> <b>bones</b> rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a lump in her breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned {{and she had a}} second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

40|$|We {{report a}} patient with therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) {{that may have been}} caused by {{regional}} radiation or hormonal therapy after surgery. A 36 -year-old Japanese woman developed right breast cancer and underwent breast-conserving surgery and regional radiation to the right breast without adjuvant systemic therapy because she wished to pre-serve her fertility. Two years later, she developed multiple bone metastases of breast cancer and received hormonal therapy.
