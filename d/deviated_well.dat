40|$|AbstractDeviated well {{is one of}} {{the main}} well types to develop coalbed methane in China. It's been widely used by various coalbed methane {{companies}} in recent years. Compared with traditional oil and gas wells, coalbed methane wells are characterized by shallow depth and strict well spacing, which means higher wellbore quality control technology. Furthermore, coalbed methane wells are apt to produce coal dust during dewatering and coal dust causes serious abrasion of pipe and rod. It's required to improve wellbore quality. This paper analyzes the weakness of current wellbore quality control standard and technology for coalbed methane wells on the basis of the characterization of coaled methane wells and finds out the key factors that control wellbore quality of coalbed methane <b>deviated</b> <b>wells.</b> The technology is developed to improve wellbore quality of coalbed methane wells from trajectory design and real-time control. Through the on-site test in Baode block, Shanxi Province, the technology is further improved and it's confirmed by the test result that this technology can improve the wellbore quality of coalbed methane <b>deviated</b> <b>wells.</b> In addition, this paper also presents some good suggestions for compiling standard about wellbore quality control for coalbed methane <b>deviated</b> <b>wells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Highly <b>deviated</b> <b>wells</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{development}} of marine oilfield, old oilfield and low permeability oilfield. However, during the drilling process, cuttings bed is often formed in the highly deviated section, which affects rate of penetration and downhole safety, and restricts the development of drilling technology of the highly <b>deviated</b> <b>wells.</b> Therefore, the critical velocity to protect stationary bed development(CVPSB) was studied to overcome the shortcoming of the critical velocity to protect bed development(CVPB). This paper advanced a new method to identify CVPSB, developed two-layer model and three-layer model, and analyzed the effect of different parameters including hole angle, cutting diameter, ROP etc on the CVPSB. This paper may serve as a guideline for controlling parameters in drilling and choosing model in developing cuttings bed software...|$|R

Salt-proximity VSPs (E) are reflection surveys to help define a salt-sediment interface near a wellbore by using a source on top of a salt dome away from the drilling rig. Drill-noise VSPs (F), also known as seismic-while-drilling (SWD) VSPs, use the noise of the drill bit as the source and receivers laid out along the ground.

50|$|Underbalanced {{drilling}} {{is usually}} {{more expensive than}} conventional drilling (when drilling a <b>deviated</b> <b>well</b> which requires directional drilling tools), and has safety issues of its own. Technically the well is always in a blowout condition unless a heavier fluid is displaced into the well. Air drilling requires a faster up hole volume as the cuttings will fall faster down the annulus when the compressors are taken off the hole compared to having a higher viscosity fluid in the hole. Because air is compressible mud pulse telemetry measurement while drilling (MWD) tools which require an incompressible fluid can not work. Common technologies used to eliminate this problem are either electromagnetic MWD tools or wireline MWD tools. Downhole mechanics are usually more violent also because the volume of fluid going through a downhole motor or downhole hammer is greater than an equivalent fluid when drilling balanced or over balanced {{because of the need}} of higher up hole velocities. Corrosion is also a problem, but can be largely avoided using a coating oil or rust inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|In seismic reservior characterization, it is {{important}} that the measured sonic log used is accurate and consistent. Due to anisotropic effects in the reservoir, which is majorly caused as a results of interbedded sequence of sand and shales, sonic log (compressional and shear wave velocities) acquired in vertical wells are different from those acquired in deviated wells. Rock physics models are created for anisotropic heterogeneous sand-shale sequence. These models are varied as a function of angle, porosity, saturation and net to gross. Variation of Thomsen anisotropic parameters and anelliptic parameters as a function of saturation and net-to-gross are investigated in order to understand the significant of anisotropy on these properties. From the rock physics modelling, anisotropic effect becomes more pronounced at high propagation angle and also the variation of the geologic parameters strongly depends on the propagation angle. Anisotropy effects decreases with increasing net-to-gross and anelliptic parameters are more sensitive to fluid saturation compared to Thomsen anisotropy parameters. A method is proposed for anisotropy correction of deviated wells using core measurement (model rock properties) of sand and shale from the study area, the inclination angle of the well and the net to gross ratio of the reservoir. The anisotropy corrected logs are then used for improved rock physics interpretation using the rock physics templates(RPT) and AVO analysis. The proposed correction is lithology dependent and the correction is significant in regions with low net-to-gross. Discrimination of lithologies and fluid saturation on the rock physics template is enhanced as a result of the anisotropy correction. The rock physics templates are constructed for different net to gross and propagation angles for varying fluid saturation in order to account for anisotropic effects. There is better separation of water sands and gas sand on the horizontal RPT(created at 72 deg) compared to vertical RPT(created at 0 deg). Vertical well, <b>deviated</b> <b>well</b> and anisotropy corrected well log data from the North Sea are superimposed on the rock-physics templates. Poor separation of lithology and saturation is observed on the RPT using the <b>deviated</b> <b>well.</b> It can be observed that the anisotropy corrected <b>deviated</b> <b>well</b> follows similar trends as the vertical well. Anisotropy effect on the reservoir properties that are accounted for using the proposed method are clearly seen on 3 D rock physics templates. AVO inversion is also performed on the horizon attribute data from study area. The inverted rock physics properties are plotted on the created rock physics models for two vertical wells from the study area. The two vertical wells show different AVO class response. The net-to-gross and porosity are different for the two wells and in general, these observations are constrained by local geology...|$|E
