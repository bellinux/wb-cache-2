His first {{marriage}} to Venita Varden in 1936 ended in 1938 when Venita got an interlocutory <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce.</b> They reconciled, but finally divorced in 1944. (She died in 1948 {{in the crash}} of United Airlines Flight 624 at Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania).|$|E
500|$|Feynman did {{not return}} to Cornell. Bacher, who had been {{instrumental}} in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from Neodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she had taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at Michigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in Boise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by his violent temper. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a Republican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing ("Where there's smoke there's fire") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of [...] "extreme cruelty". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.|$|E
2500|$|Manson {{received}} five years' parole in September 1958, {{the same}} year in which Rosalie received a <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce.</b> By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman with an arrest record for prostitution made a [...] "tearful plea" [...] before the court that she and Manson were [...] "deeply in love... and would marry if Charlie were freed." [...] Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so testimony against him would not be required of her.|$|E

However, Daines was re-elected with his majority reduced to 7,359. In October 1952 he had some negative publicity when his wife obtained a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> against him on grounds of his misconduct.|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} on child support payments {{has suggested that}} a large problem exists with post-divorce payments of child support. Much of this research, however, suffers from the methodological flaws of mixing together people who wers divorced with people who were never married any of questioning only the custodial parent:. This study surveyed a sample <b>of</b> 378 <b>divorcing</b> families and obtained matched data from both custodial and noncustodial parents. Respondents were interviewed immediately after their divorce and again one year later. In addition, <b>decrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> were examined and payment records were analyzed through the clerk of the court. The results revealed that only 80 % <b>of</b> the <b>decrees</b> contained the provision that child support be paid through the clerk. Regardless <b>of</b> what the <b>decree</b> ordered, most parents paid directly to the custodial parent. This finding suggests that to rely on clerk records exclusively yields a highly misleading underestimate of child support payments...|$|R
2500|$|While in New York, he courted Ethel May Hamilton, {{an actress}} who had {{appeared}} in the stage musical Florodora under the name Ethel May Harrison. [...] Her father was a broker, and was an investor in the English antiques store on Fifth Avenue that employed Taylor, The Antique Shoppe. The couple married in an Episcopal ceremony on 7 December 1901, at the Little Church Around the Corner, [...] and had a daughter in 1902 or 1903. Taylor was active socially, belonging to a yacht club, and know to carry on affairs with women. The Deane-Tanners were well known in New York society and members of several clubs. He was known as a ladies' man and a heavy drinker, possibly depressed, when he abruptly vanished on 23 October 1908, at the age of 36, deserting his wife and their daughter, Ethel Daisy. After Taylor's disappearance, friends said he had suffered [...] "mental lapses" [...] before, and his family thought at first he had wandered off during an episode of amnesia. His wife obtained a state <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> in 1912.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} came {{the little red}} bull, drawing the cart to the office door. Justice Benaja Widdup had his shoes on, for he was expecting the visit. In his {{presence}} Ransie Bilbro handed to his wife a five-dollar bill. The official's eye sharply viewed it. It seemed to curl up {{as though it had}} been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun-barrel. But the Justice refrained from comment. It is true that other bills might be inclined to curl. He handed each one a <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce.</b> Each stood awkwardly silent, slowly folding the guarantee of freedom. The woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at Ransie.|$|E

50|$|In 1883 Chisholm {{left town}} suddenly, having {{suffered}} a large business loss around $100,000 and used clients money to repay. He and his 15-year-old son fled to Evanton, Illinois, just outside Chicago. His wife was ill {{at the time}} and she later came to Chicago and petitioned for a divorce. Eventually she secured a <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> absolute <b>divorce.</b> Although the legality <b>of</b> this <b>divorce</b> under Canadian law was questioned, she remarried in July 1889, to the Hon. George Eulas Foster, Minister of Finance for Canada.|$|R
50|$|For {{three years}} Paget took his theatre company on tour around Britain and Europe. His wife disapproved of his {{lifestyle}} and obtained a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> on 7 November 1900; {{the marriage was}} later annulled due to nonconsummation, according to Lady Anglesey's grandson by her second marriage, the historian Christopher Simon Sykes. The breakdown of his marriage effectively gave Paget more freedom to enjoy his self-indulgent lifestyle. By this stage he {{had already begun to}} mortgage his estates to raise money.|$|R
60|$|The course which things thus took {{created a}} great deal of delay in the formal annulling of the {{marriage}} with Catharine, which Henry was too impatient and imperious to bear. He would not wait for the <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> but took Anne Boleyn for his wife before his previous connection was made void. He said he was privately married to her. This he had, as he maintained, a right to do, for he considered his first marriage as void, absolutely and of itself, without any decree. When, at length, the decree was finally passed, he brought Anne Boleyn forward as his queen, and introduced her as such to England and to the world by a genuine marriage and a most magnificent coronation. The people of England pitied poor Catharine, but they joined very cordially, notwithstanding, in welcoming the youthful and beautiful lady who was to take her place. All London gave itself up to festivities and rejoicings on the occasion of these nuptials. Immediately after this the young queen retired to her palace in Greenwich, and in two or three months afterward little Elizabeth was born. Her birth-day was the 7th of September, 1533.|$|E

She was outraged, and the local Conservatives were sympathetic to her. Somerset de Chair was left in no doubt {{that he would not be}} readopted, and on 14 June 1950 he announced that he would not be fighting the next election. On 28 June, Judge Bensley Wells granted Thelma de Chair a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> on grounds <b>of</b> the adultery of her husband in an undefended suit.|$|R
5000|$|When Brignoli went on his European {{tour in the}} 1870s, {{his wife}} {{accompanied}} him. The failure of the venture made him angry and abusive and their relationship intolerable. She also learned {{that he was being}} unfaithful. She returned to New York and filed for divorce. The charges made against Brignoli were [...] "habitual cruelty, a neglect to provide for his wife, and adultery." [...] The charge of adultery was proven to the satisfaction of the Referee and the judge issued a <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> absolute <b>divorce.</b> Brignoli sailed back to Europe the same day to complete his engagements in England.|$|R
50|$|Marital rape {{is not a}} {{criminal}} offence in Niue. A man cannot be convicted of the rape or attempted rape of his wife unless a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> nullity, judicial separation, or separation order was {{in place at the}} time of the act. Sexual violence against girls is addressed in the Niue Act 1966, which provides that those who have or attempt sexual intercourse with a girl under 15 are liable to terms of imprisonment. Despite this, sexual assault on minors has been reported as occurring “regularly”. Cultural and societal beliefs have the effect of inhibiting the reporting of these offences. Where complaints are lodged, they are frequently subsequently withdrawn or dropped. The introduction of a mandatory reporting obligation on figures of authority, and a “no-drop” policy ensuring cases are not closed prematurely have been touted as possible solutions.|$|R

50|$|He married {{first in}} 1921, then {{secondly}} in 1944 and {{was granted a}} <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> in 1956. He married again in September 1954, in New Jersey, to Baroness Huszar, a Hungarian. In 1954 his second wife was arrested in Montreal, for possessing counterfeit United States money, and acquitted after trial. He later won a lawsuit against her solicitor, who had argued that although he had conducted her defence without entering Canada, he was a licensed Canadian solicitor {{as well as an}} English one and thus not required to comply with English regulations. His wife was again, however, arrested in 1955, this time for the possession of narcotics; she was convicted, and they were divorced in 1959.|$|R
50|$|On leave {{again in}} 1938, he married Margaret McWilliam. However, {{she refused to}} go back with him to Northern Rhodesia and he never saw her again. On his return, he was posted to Balovale in the {{northwest}} province, and acted as Secretary on the Balovale Commission under MacDonell. Jones was appointed District Commissioner, Balovale, in July 1939. After Britain’s declaration of war against Germany, his request for leave to go on active service was rejected. In June 1942 he was granted a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> from his wife, which was made absolute on 26 October 1942. On 8 November, he married Nancy Featherstone, a nurse working in Northern Rhodesia. He was subsequently posted to Feira in the Eastern Province where his wife bore two children, Elisabeth in 1944 and Timothy in 1946.|$|R
5000|$|The Prince and Princess of Wales: where Shackleton {{represented}} the Prince. Diana {{was able to}} negotiate a £17 million settlement and observers saw the outcome as a creditable draw. On the same date that Buckingham Palace announced {{to the public that}} the Prince and Princess had reached a settlement, The Queen issued Letters Patent to regulate the styles and titles of former members of the Royal Family after divorce. Information about those Letters Patent was included by the Palace in the same press release that contained the announcement <b>of</b> the <b>divorce</b> agreement. In accordance with those Letters Patent, Diana lost her style of Royal Highness when the <b>decree</b> absolute <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> was issued. The forfeiture of the title of Royal Highness is often attributed to the diligence of Shackleton, but styles of members of the Royal Family are governed by the prerogative of the Sovereign.|$|R

50|$|A {{divorce in}} England and Wales is only {{possible}} for marriages {{of more than}} one year and when the marriage has irretrievably broken down. Whilst it is possible to defend a divorce, the vast majority proceed on an undefended basis.

5000|$|The {{taxpayer}} {{must be able}} {{to claim}} an exemption for the child. However, this test is still met if the only reason that the taxpayer cannot claim the child's exemption is that the noncustodial parent is claiming the exemption (under a written release of exemption or a pre-1985 <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> decree of separate maintenance, or written separation agreement).|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} leaving Parliament, Turner's extravagant {{lifestyle}} {{caught up with}} him. He had spent more on expenses while being a Member of Parliament than he had received in salary, which he put down to the [...] "great deal of entertaining" [...] {{he had to do}} in connection with the University. He had had to borrow a great deal from his bank, and his decision to stand down from Parliament was actually prompted by financial difficulties: in 1958 his affairs were placed in the hands of accountants and a committee of creditors. He was declared bankrupt, and disclosed liabilities of £6,956 compared with assets of £662. The bankruptcy hearing referred discreetly to [...] "marital difficulties" [...] which had also affected him; in 1966 Turner's wife, whom he had married in 1938, obtained a <b>decree</b> nisi <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> against him on grounds of his desertion.|$|R
2500|$|Days {{before the}} <b>decree</b> {{absolute}} <b>of</b> <b>divorce,</b> letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older than yours, Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|R

[...] The court will grant a <b>decree</b> <b>of</b> <b>divorce</b> [...] "if it is satisfied that the marriage relationship between the parties to the marriage has reached such a state of disintegration that there is no reasonable prospect of the restoration of a normal marriage relationship." [...] This ground of divorce is {{the same as that of}} irretrievable breakdown of the marriage in terms of section 4 of the Divorce Act. Whether or not the courts will interpret the provisions of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act on the irretrievable breakdown ground of divorce in the same way as they have interpreted this ground under the Divorce Act remains to be seen.|$|E
