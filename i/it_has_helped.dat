Sports originating in England include association football, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, rounders, hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> the development of golf, sailing and Formula One.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E

25|$|Early {{versions}} of the SD specification were available only after agreeing to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that prohibited development of an open source driver. However, the system was eventually reverse-engineered, and free software drivers provided access to SD cards that did not use DRM. Since then, the SDA has provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license. Although most open-source drivers were written before this, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> to solve compatibility issues.|$|E
25|$|Kebara 2 is {{the most}} {{complete}} post-cranial Neanderthal skeleton ever found and has {{played a major role}} in three debates on Neanderthal anatomy and behaviour, namely the anatomical constraints of childbirth, their ability to speak, and the shape and size of their chests. The first of these debates <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> settle, the second it has not, and the third it has sparked by questioning the barrel-shape that Neanderthal chests were thought to have since they were described by Hermann Schaaffhausen in 1858.|$|E
25|$|UNICEF. UNICEF is {{particularly}} active in school {{water supply and}} sanitation, {{as well as in}} hygiene education through schools. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> to provide schools with 170 wells and rehabilitate 50 water pumps. This has contributed to reducing the prevalence of guinea worm infection from 1,956 cases in 2000 to 30 cases in 2005 and also to increasing water access in schools from 39% to 82% over the same period. Sanitation and hygiene education was intensified, using primary schools as an entry point: 139 schools were equipped with special latrines, teacher and students were trained in hygiene education, and children participated in activities targeting behavior change in families.|$|E

One program that signals the shift was the foundation's support as the underwriter of Spike Lee's documentary on New Orleans, When the Levees Broke.

25|$|The first {{seeks to}} resolve a longstanding debate in {{historical}} linguistics by making a case for the Kurgan hypothesis {{on the origins of}} the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, {{were it not for the}} ability to digest milk.|$|E

25|$|Rwanda’s {{experiment}} in mass community-based justice {{has been a}} mixed success. Many Rwandans agree that it has shed light on what happened in their local communities during the 100 days of genocide in 1994, even {{if not all of}} the truth was revealed. They say it helped some families find murdered relatives’ bodies which they could finally bury with some dignity. It has also ensured that tens of thousands of perpetrators were brought to justice. Some Rwandans say that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> set in motion reconciliation within their communities. The majority of praise for Gacaca has come from Rwanda's government and the Rwandan citizens who have direct experience with the system. Naturally this is a biased source, however {{it is important to note}} that it is those most affected by the Rwandan genocide who are offering praise, citing a sense of closure, acceptance, and forgiveness following Gacaca trials. The Gacaca trials also served to promote reconciliation by providing a means for victims to learn the truth about the death of their family members and relatives. They also gave perpetrators the opportunity to confess their crimes, show remorse and ask for forgiveness in front of their community.|$|E

Ruggiero also discusses Occupy's success in the United States, stating that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> to change media discussions by introducing terms like [...] "the 99%" [...] into popular discourse and also by bringing national attention to the plight of the impoverished. He remarks that the protest movement has not only helped to highlight the [...] "heartlessness and inhumanity" [...] of the socio-political system, but that it has also helped to provide solidarity with those [...] "being crushed" [...] under that system.

[...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar."

25|$|As Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, {{though a}} Dorian city, had ended its close {{relations}} with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,144), and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,178).
