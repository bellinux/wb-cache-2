5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to <b>hum</b> <b>to</b> each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional <b>hum</b> <b>to</b> the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Dalmatia in July 1357. Split, Trogir, and Šibenik soon {{got rid of}} Venetian {{governors}} and yielded to Louis. After a short siege, Louis's army also captured Zadar {{with the assistance of}} its townspeople. Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who had succeeded Louis's father-in-law in 1353, surrendered western <b>Hum</b> <b>to</b> Louis, who claimed that territory as his wife's dowry. In the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358, the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and Durazzo in favor of Louis. The Republic of Ragusa also accepted Louis's suzerainty. The Dalmatian towns remained self-governing communities, owing only a yearly tribute and naval service to Louis, who also abolished all commercial restrictions that had been introduced during the Venetians' rule. The merchants of Ragusa were explicitly entitled to freely trade in Serbia even during a war between Hungary and Serbia.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Jackson was {{contacted}} by Ric Birch of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) to mix sound for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney. Jackson felt that his skills {{would be put}} to best use as organiser and audio director rather than as one man behind a mixing console. He put together a team of audio professionals {{as well as an}} equipment design composed of digital nodes linked with optic fibre to transport digital audio around the largest venues without attenuation or ground <b>hum.</b> <b>To</b> wire the spectacle which played to 110,000 people in attendance and some 3billion distant viewers around the world, redundant systems were connected throughout so that a single failure point could not halt the show. To complete the assignment, Jackson said one of the main factors was working within budget, which was not unlimited as it had been with Streisand. He served as audio director for the opening ceremony on 15 September and the closing ceremony on 1 October. Before the event, he told a reporter, [...] "I have a well rehearsed crew in place and {{there is every reason to}} expect it to go well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Lane of The New Yorker {{states that}} [...] "there is barely any music, sensual or otherwise, and Carter Burwell's score {{is little more}} than a fitful murmur", and Douglas McFarland states that [...] "perhaps [...] salient formal {{characteristic}} is the absence, with one telling exception, of a musical soundtrack, creating a mood conducive to thoughtful and unornamented speculation in what is otherwise a fierce and destructive landscape." [...] Jay Ellis, however, disagrees. [...] " [...] missed the extremely quiet but audible fade in a few tones from a keyboard beginning when Chigurh flips the coin for the gas station man", he said. [...] "This ambient music (by long-time Coens collaborator Carter Burwell) grows imperceptibly in volume so that it is easily missed as an element of the mis-en-scene. But it is there, telling our unconscious that something different is occurring with the toss; this becomes certain when it ends as Chigurh uncovers the coin on the counter. The deepest danger has passed as soon as Chigurh finds (and Javier Bardem's acting confirms this) and reveals to the man that he has won." [...] In order to achieve such sound effect, Burwell [...] "tuned the music's swelling <b>hum</b> <b>to</b> the 60-hertz frequency of a refrigerator." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Deol {{appeared}} in the action drama Badal alongside Rani Mukerji, under the director's helm of Raj Kanwar. The film is set in 1984 when riots were engulfing parts of Punjab and Delhi. Deol plays the character of Badal, a boy who witnesses the massacre {{of his family and}} villagers by the corrupt Police Inspector Jai Singh Rana (Ashutosh Rana) and grows up to be a dreaded terrorist, fueled by the anger and hatred of the authorities who wrongly deprived him of his family and friends. The film is inspired by [...] The Devil's Own (1997), starring Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford. Following this he starred alongside Karisma Kapoor in <b>Hum</b> <b>To</b> Mohabbat Karega (2000), and reunited with Rani Mukerji to star in Bichhoo (2000), a blatant remake of Luc Besson's 1994 film Leon, starring Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. In Bichhoo, Deol plays Reno's role, Jeeva, a young man from a struggling middle-class family who has the misfortune of falling in love with the wealthy Kiran (Malaika Arora). Her cruel, disapproving father in rage at their relationship has Jeeva's mother and two sisters publicly arrested for prostitution, and eventually all three kill themselves. Jeeva becomes a professional killer and later exacts vengeance against Kiran's father and his henchmen. He and his neighbour Kiran Bali (Mukherjee) soon witness the entire Bali family get murdered. Jeeva now decides to help Kiran seek revenge on the men who killed her family. The film and Deol's performance was panned by the critics, with Sakanya Verna of Rediff.com citing the film as [...] "one of the most painful of the year" [...] and commenting, [...] "Bobby Deol's performance is quite, well, robotic. He religiously hangs on to a brooding expression right through the film. Why o why doesn't someone insist he goes to an acting school?" ...|$|E

He used to array himself in his regimentals, and saunter about like {{an officer of the}} Coldstream Guards, strolling down to his club in St. James's.

60|$|HAVING {{accompanied}} Sir James Boss on his {{voyage of}} discovery to the Antarctic regions, where botany was my chief pursuit, on my return I earnestly desired {{to add to}} my acquaintance with {{the natural history of}} the temperate zones, more knowledge of that of the tropics than I bad hitherto had the opportunity of acquiring.

60|$|She {{shook her}} head with parted lips and a slight touch of girlish coquetry in her manner.

I started--as well I might--for I recognized one of Enriquez' favorite and most extravagant guitar solos. It was audacious; it was barbaric; it was, I fear, vulgar. As I remembered it--as he sang it--it recounted the adventures of one Don Francisco, a provincial gallant and roisterer of the most objectionable type. It had one hundred and four verses, which Enriquez never spared me. I shuddered as in a pleasant, quiet voice the correct Miss Mannersley warbled in musical praise of the PELLEJO, or wineskin, and a eulogy of the dicebox came caressingly from her thin red lips. But the company was far differently affected: the strange, wild air and wilder accompaniment were evidently catching; people moved toward the piano; somebody whistled the air from a distant corner; even the faces of the geologist and doctor brightened.|$|E
60|$|When our {{five weeks}} at the seaside were up, {{and it was}} time to go home, we had great questionings what was to be done with <b>Hum.</b> <b>To</b> get him home with us was our desire; but who ever heard of a humming-bird {{travelling}} by railroad? Great were the consultings. A little basket of Indian work was filled up with cambric handkerchiefs, and a bottle of sugar and water provided, and we started with him for a day's journey. When we arrived at night the first care was to see what had become of Hum, who had not been looked at since we fed him with sugar and water in Boston. We found him alive and well, but so dead asleep that we could not wake him to roost; so we put him to bed on a toilet cushion, and arranged his tumbler for morning. The next day found him alive and humming, exploring the room and pictures, perching now here and now there; but as the weather was chilly, he sat for the most part of the time in a humped-up state on the tip of a pair of stag's horns. We moved him to a more sunny apartment; but, alas! the equinoctial storm came on, and there was no sun to be had for days. Hum was blue; the pleasant seaside days were over; his room was lonely, the pleasant three that had enlivened the apartment at Rye no longer came in and out; evidently he was lonesome, and gave way to depression. One chilly morning he managed again to fall into his tumbler, and wet himself through; and notwithstanding warm bathings and tender nursings, the poor little fellow seemed to get diphtheria, or something quite as bad for humming-birds.|$|E
