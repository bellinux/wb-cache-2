5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E

5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E

25|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{aspect of the}} censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, {{but the fact that}} Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity. Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> mass. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.|$|E
